1
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,300
Jack, this is hard for me.

2
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,860
The Chinese have proof that you led the assault on their consulate.

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,800
And now the Chinese want me.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,010
That's right.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,540
Listen to me very carefully.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,620
The man they sent to take you into custody has orders to kill you.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,780
Orders from who?

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,970
Someone in Logan's camp.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,680
Dale Spaulding, Secret Service.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,070
I have orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,680
I intend to execute those orders.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,200
Jack.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,090
He's dead.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,770
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,600
Oh, Jack.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,090
Give me the epinephrine.

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,330
I hope it's not too late.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,410
He really looks dead.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,820
Come on, Jack!

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,450
Come on, Jack, damn it!

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,430
Hey.

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,790
All right, Chloe, I need you to run interference with the local coroner.

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,360
Make sure their database synchs up with Jack's information.

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,670
That won't cover the autopsy.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,010
There's not going to be an autopsy.

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,460
They wanted Jack dead,

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,270
now he's dead.

28
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,640
Mr. President, you saved my life.

29
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm only sorry it came to this.

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,610
I just wanted to let you know that I was out.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,390
I'm glad.

32
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,060
Jack, you do understand that when you hang up

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,520
for all intents and purposes.

34
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,250
Jack Bauer is dead.

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,220
I understand that, sir.

36
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,390
Mr. President,

37
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,170
it's been an honor.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,360
Jim Nichols!

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,300
You're on pump number one.

40
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,750
Sterling Rush, Patrick Priest!

41
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,800
You're on pump number four.

42
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,300
Phil Stone, Greg Nelson, you're on pump five.

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,100
Sorry, guys, that's all I got today.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,660
Hey, Frank?

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,300
Look, I... I know I promised you work today, but...

46
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,160
pump seven went off line last night.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,800
That's all right, I'll try again tomorrow.

48
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,700
Yeah, tomorrow'll be much better.

49
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,400
See you tomorrow.

50
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,960
The sun is shining,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,900
but the air is cool at President Logan's retreat

52
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,060
where Russian President Yuri Suvarov

53
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,500
is expected to arrive later this morning.

54
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,360
Everything worked for me

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,800
up until the chapter on your first campaign.

56
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,550
I'm sorry, but I think it's a little long winded

57
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,640
and I think that we can cut that down by half.

58
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,700
So, why don't we start with the paragraph...?

59
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,800
You didn't hear a word I just said, did you?

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
Yes, I was listening.

61
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,000
No, you weren't.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
You're right.

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,750
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,960
Are you okay?

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,700
I can use a break.

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,900
What's going on?

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,960
What do you mean?

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,500
I mean you've been distracted ever since you got to Los Angeles.

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,460
I don't know, it's...

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,800
it's like you're somewhere else.

71
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,200
Writing my memoirs...

72
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,000
maybe it's put me in a melancholy mood.

73
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,600
Is that all it is?

74
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,900
Yeah.

75
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,400
David... I'm your brother.

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,200
It's all right, really.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Okay.

79
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Well, then let's get back to work.

80
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,150
One more chapter and we'll take a break.

81
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,800
Why don't we jump down to... um... chapter six?

82
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,510
There's going to be a lot of questions

83
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,200
about your relationship with Sherry.

84
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,900
David!

85
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,700
No, no, no, no, no...

86
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,900
get help!

87
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,950
Stay with me.

88
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,340
Stay with me!

89
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,700
Get help!

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,800
Walt.

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,860
My chair?

92
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,800
Don't worry, Mr. President.

93
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,700
I had it adjusted.

94
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,560
Good.

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,860
Adjusted? Wait a minute.

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,450
What are we talking about here?

97
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,960
Yuri Suvarov is over six feet.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,060
Russian president can't be looking down

99
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
on the President of the United States when the cameras roll.

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,060
That's a risky proposition, Walt.

101
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,900
The press finds out about it and they...

102
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,210
Don't underestimate the power of the image, Mike.

103
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,970
Stalin and Churchill, they both sat for FDR at Yalta.

104
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,660
This is the defining moment of my administration.

105
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,400
We have to make sure that the media presents it the right way.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,300
I'll get it.

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
Yeah, put him through.

108
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,850
Have you checked on my wife?

109
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
Ah, she's still getting ready.

110
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,300
- She'll be fine, sir.  - Hmm.

111
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,900
I'm in contact with Dr. Hill.

112
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,000
I'd feel better if you would check on her yourself.

113
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
She cannot have one of her meltdowns today.

114
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,160
Look...

115
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,500
you're the only one she listens to, walt.

116
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,650
Yes, sir.

117
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,900
Thank you.

118
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,900
Mike?

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,900
Mike, what is it?

120
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,000
David Palmer's been assassinated.

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
What?

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,400
It just happened.

123
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, my god.

124
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
Where?

125
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,200
In L.A.

126
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
I don't believe this.

127
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,760
Mr. President, uh...

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,300
CTU is standing by to brief you directly.

129
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Whenever you're ready.

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,200
Make sure LAPD sets up a hard perimeter.

131
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,660
They're sending everyone they've got.

132
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,500
- Where are they on witnesses?  - Nowhere yet.

133
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,660
Who's running search and sweep?

134
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,500
Secret Service, but they're shorthanded.

135
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,660
Narrow the search area.

136
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,200
Make sure ballistics runs a line of fire trajectory.

137
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,000
Sir, President Logan's ready.

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll call ballistics.

139
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,400
Put the President through.

140
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes, sir, go ahead.

141
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Mr. President.

142
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,300
Bill...

143
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,950
not to diminish the loss that we're all feeling right now,

144
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,400
but I'm expecting the Russian president very soon, so...

145
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,600
let's say what needs to be said.

146
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,800
Of course, sir.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Have you arrested the person who did this?

148
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,260
Not yet, sir.

149
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,700
Then what do you have?

150
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,500
Sir, the damage inflicted by the single shot indicates

151
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,660
that President Palmer was hit

152
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,800
by a 308 caliber bullet fired from an adjacent building.

153
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,900
We've initiated an interagency protocol, level five...

154
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,260
Don't...

155
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,900
don't give me protocols, Bill.

156
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,060
Give me results.

157
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,500
Whoever did this, I want them dead or in custody

158
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,900
by the time the Russians get here.

159
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,260
Yes, Mr. President.

160
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,600
But until we know more,

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,600
I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty, sir.

162
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,760
No.

163
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,760
Absolutely not.

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,060
Mr. President, we can't discount the possibility

165
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,900
that this attack is somehow connected to the arms agreement.

166
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,560
A former president was assassinated 15 miles from where you are

167
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,200
and I'm sure I don't need to explain the significance of this day.

168
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,100
Do you realize what kind of political

169
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,060
and economic capital

170
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,700
I've spent just to get the Russians to the table?

171
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,100
If we call this off, they won't come back.

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,900
Spencer?

173
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,100
Spencer!

174
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,460
What?

175
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
Get out of my bed.

176
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,600
Yeah.

177
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,000
I had a good time last night, too.

178
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,500
I'm serious, this was a mistake.

179
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,660
Get out of here.

180
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,100
What do you mean, a mistake?

181
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,660
We had a great time.

182
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,300
I don't get involved with people who work for me.

183
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
It's too late for that.

184
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,160
I would appreciate it

185
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,460
if you didn't tell everybody at work about this.

186
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't want everyone thinking I'm some kind of slut.

187
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,700
Believe me, no one's ever going to think that.

188
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,600
What's that supposed to mean?

189
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,600
You should lighten up, you know?

190
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,200
You'll live longer.

191
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,660
What are you doing?

192
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,400
When you quit overanalyzing the situation,

193
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,060
I think you're gonna find out

194
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,200
that you and I are pretty good together.

195
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
So I'm telling you in advance, yes.

196
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,700
Yes, what?

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll let you buy me dinner.

198
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,160
Get me drunk.

199
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,500
Have your way with me.

200
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,000
Anytime you want.

201
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,400
You know, um, arrogance doesn't turn me on.

202
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,810
I've read that some women respond to it,

203
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,200
but I'm just letting you know, I don't.

204
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,460
What is it?

205
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,600
President Palmer's been shot.

206
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,800
He's dead.

207
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,360
Who is it?

208
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,800
It's me, Frank.

209
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Hey.

210
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,400
I saw your truck outside.

211
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,660
I thought you were on today.

212
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,000
- Oh, Ned didn't need me this morning.  - Hmm.

213
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
It's so terrible, what happened.

214
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,400
Are you okay?

215
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

216
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,160
Come on, I'm making breakfast.

217
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,220
Okay.

218
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,300
Frank's gonna join us.

219
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,360
Great.

220
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,240
Derek, stop it.

221
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,010
Morning.

222
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,800
Use a glass, please.

223
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,690
Here.

224
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,400
Excuse me.

225
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,520
Can I ask you something, Frank?

226
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,900
Yeah, sure.

227
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,730
That rig in Alaska you worked on,

228
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,350
what was that called again?

229
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
The albatross.

230
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,980
And you were there last year?

231
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,280
Yeah, why?

232
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,450
It's funny.

233
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,220
My friend's got a brother who's been working on that rig for five years

234
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,210
and he's never heard of any Frank Flynn.

235
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,830
It's a big platform.

236
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,790
Yeah, well, my friend's brother says everyone knows everyone.

237
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,300
What is this, an interrogation?

238
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,450
I just don't like being lied to.

239
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,430
Derek.

240
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,890
No, it's all right.

241
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,050
No one's lying to you, Derek.

242
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,240
Really?

243
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,150
When you're out there, a lot of the guys just use nicknames.

244
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,630
Yeah.

245
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,040
What's your friend's brother's name?

246
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,550
Eat your breakfast.

247
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,120
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

248
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,330
Sorry.

249
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,010
He's just kind of protective of me.

250
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,120
But it's the best thing in the world for him to have a man around here.

251
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,390
Look, what he said about me and Alaska...

252
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,890
No, you don't owe me an explanation.

253
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,950
I figure if you had wanted to tell me about your past you would have told me already.

254
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,250
I trust my instincts

255
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,610
and I trust you.

256
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,410
Former President David Palmer was killed just a short while ago.

257
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,490
Now, no information has been released to the public at this time,

258
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,820
but an independent source has verified that palmer was in Los Angeles

259
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,810
visiting his brother and former White...

260
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,830
Bill will call if he needs us, you know that.

261
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,960
No, he won't.

262
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,520
Authorities are remaining very tightlipped as

263
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,840
the LAPD and secret service seal off the area

264
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,040
and there has been no word on whether this was an accident...

265
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,490
It's not our job.

266
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,570
This is different.

267
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,670
Come on, Michelle.

268
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,940
I'm just as upset as you are.

269
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,380
David Palmer meant a lot to me, too.

270
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,260
But there are other people at CTU who can handle this.

271
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,670
No one who was active during the other attempts on his life.

272
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,630
Tony, you and I worked up suspect profiles.

273
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,950
We ran scenarios.

274
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,540
And they have our records on file.

275
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,530
They don't have our experience.

276
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,550
I never once regretted our decision to leave CTU.

277
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,730
But I don't want to look back on today and realize I could have helped.

278
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,210
We're running a business here, Michelle.

279
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,610
Rick Rosen is expecting us to make a presentation in less than an hour.

280
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,090
You can handle the meeting on your own.

281
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,100
Michelle, don't do this.

282
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,380
It's Rick, leave me a message.

283
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,890
Yeah, Rick, it's Tony Almeida.

284
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,860
Look, I just wanted to call you and let you know

285
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,870
that Michelle's not gonna be able to make our meeting today.

286
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,710
She had to go someplace.

287
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,480
On second thought...

288
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,680
I'm going with her.

289
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,590
Michelle!

290
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,700
Michelle!

291
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,820
Did Jepson brief you on what's happening?

292
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,100
Said there was a car bombing.

293
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,610
Two former CTU agents were hit.

294
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,850
Yeah, their names are Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.

295
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,310
You knew them?

296
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,300
Yeah.

297
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,470
We're data mining for a connection between them and President Palmer.

298
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,290
I sent the parameters to your screen.

299
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,230
I'll get on it.

300
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:32,810
Yeah?

301
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,340
It's Edgar, are you coming in?

302
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,680
Yeah, I just got paged on a level five protocol,

303
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,930
of course I'm coming in.

304
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,400
I wanted to give you a heads up before you got here.

305
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,420
Heads up?

306
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,670
It's bad, Chloe.

307
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah, President Palmer was gunned down.

308
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,650
I'd say that's pretty bad.

309
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,750
It's not just him.

310
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,650
What are you talking about?

311
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,470
Someone planted abomb in Michelle Dessler's car.

312
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,100
What?

313
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,800
Michelle's dead.

314
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,370
Tony's not doing too good.

315
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,790
Doesn't make any sense.

316
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,310
They were retired.

317
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,470
Buchanan thinks it's linked to Palmer somehow.

318
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,530
We're cross referencing everything we have on Palmer with Tony and Michelle

319
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,390
to see if we can find a connection,

320
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,340
anything they may have had in common.

321
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,480
Chloe?

322
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,230
Go.

323
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,100
- Chloe?  - I'll call you back.

324
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,140
- Why?  - I'll call you back.

325
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,910
Chloe?

326
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,760
Since I don't have to go to work today,

327
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,390
I can take care of the fence out back if you want.

328
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,810
Oh, that'd be great.

329
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,930
I can't thank you enough for all the work you've down around here.

330
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,340
It's the least I could do.

331
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,390
Excuse me.

332
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,350
Yeah?

333
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,920
Jack, I know this isn't protocol.

334
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,960
Please don't hang up on me, I need your help.

335
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,490
Uh, hold on, I can barely hear you.

336
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,380
I don't have a very good signal. Excuse me.

337
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,210
What is it?

338
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,220
They got Tony and Michelle.

339
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,970
Michelle is dead. Tony is in critical condition.

340
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,100
Now they're gonna kill me.

341
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,760
What are you talking about?

342
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,150
There's four people that know you're alive.

343
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,990
Three of them are down.

344
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,270
Jack, I'm the only one left.

345
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,400
This has to be about you.

346
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,320
It's the only thing the four of us have in common.

347
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,570
What happened to Tony and Michelle?

348
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,200
There was a car bomb.

349
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,250
There was a guy outside my apartment and he was chasing me.

350
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,830
Oh, my god.

351
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,030
Where is he now?

352
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,360
I think I lost him.

353
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,190
I'm at a pay phone, I dumped my cell phone.

354
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,410
I don't know what to do now.

355
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,140
Chloe, you need to go dark.

356
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,310
That means zero contact with anyone.

357
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,230
Even CTU?

358
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,330
Especially CTU.

359
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,550
Whoever's behind this is probably monitoring them.

360
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,490
Someone out there knows I'm still alive.

361
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,640
Who?

362
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,700
I don't know, but that's what we need to find out.

363
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,080
Right now, I want you to head north out of Los Angeles.

364
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,240
There's an abandoned oil refinery at Variel and Topanga.

365
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,780
I want you to wait for me there.

366
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,190
You can take cover by the large storage tanks at the north end of the field.

367
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,620
You're coming to L.A.?

368
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,820
Give me about a half an hour.

369
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,210
Okay, thanks.

370
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,690
Tony Almeida is being medevaced in.

371
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,790
We have a trauma team standing by to receive him in medical.

372
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,520
You're bringing him to CTU?

373
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,880
If there's a second attempt on his life, we can't protect him in a hospital.

374
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,160
This doesn't track.

375
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,620
Michelle and Tony have been inactive for over a year.

376
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,600
Who'd want them dead?

377
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,390
Whoever wanted Palmer dead.

378
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,350
So we're assuming they're connected.

379
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,310
The timing was too close to write it off as a coincidence.

380
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,280
There is a connection.

381
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,820
Let's find it.

382
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,450
Sir, the DOD liaison is here.

383
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,990
I need to set her up with the security protocols for the Summit.

384
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,210
I'll take care of it.

385
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,840
You have your assignments.

386
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,710
Send updates directly to my screen.

387
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,760
Where is she?

388
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,220
She just cleared security.

389
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,050
Thank you.

390
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,200
Audrey.

391
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,050
Bill.

392
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,250
Must be hard for you to be back here.

393
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,870
Thank you, Bill, I'm fine.

394
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,010
I'm sorry about Michelle.

395
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,440
Walt Cummings briefed me on the way over here.

396
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,140
He said that you wanted to postpone the signing of the treaty.

397
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,700
President Logan is making a mistake.

398
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,480
I don't disagree.

399
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,560
Have you let him know that?

400
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,470
He's the President, Bill.

401
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,820
It's his call.

402
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,900
That's what I'm afraid of.

403
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,870
He wants me to make sure that your top priority is still security for the Summit.

404
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,030
Station five is set up for you.

405
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,700
When you're situated, we'll go over the revised security protocol.

406
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,280
Great, thank you, Bill.

407
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,860
David Palmer was a man of truth and of honor

408
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,110
and his influence will be felt for generations to come.

409
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,950
Our nation grieves for its loss.

410
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,790
Martha and I offer our deepest sympathy.

411
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,850
You look beautiful, Mrs. Logan.

412
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,850
I look like a wedding cake.

413
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,060
Let's start over.

414
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,560
Oh, you can get that.

415
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,040
Is Mrs. Logan ready?

416
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,100
Not quite.

417
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,580
You didn't tell her about David Palmer?

418
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,310
No.

419
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,680
Thank you.

420
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,530
She'll take it hard when she finds out.

421
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,720
They've been friends for a long time.

422
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,190
You don't have to talk about me like I'm not here.

423
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,630
Excuse us, Evelyn.

424
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,820
Martha.

425
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,540
I...

426
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,020
I'm sorry, look, I know...

427
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,070
I know I'm late, I'm sorry.

428
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,670
I just... I'm having a bad hair day.

429
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,850
Martha...

430
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,300
I've got some very bad news.

431
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,170
But...

432
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,120
- it's not Charles, is it?  - No.

433
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,380
No, he's fine.

434
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,910
He wanted to tell you himself...

435
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,280
Well...

436
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,300
What? Walt, Walt...

437
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,770
well, what...

438
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,630
what is it?

439
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,820
David Palmer was assassinated.

440
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,650
No...

441
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,690
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,310
I know how close you were.

443
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,680
When did this happen?

444
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,030
Less than an hour ago.

445
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,740
This morning?

446
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,710
I...

447
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,620
I...

448
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,870
I have to talk to Charles.

449
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,000
He's doing damage control,

450
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,940
trying to keep this from pushing the treaty off the front page.

451
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,160
No, no, oh, no, I have to talk to him now.

452
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,560
- No, he's doing a press conference...  - no!

453
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,340
Martha!

454
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,950
Martha!

455
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:35,990
Agent North!

456
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,360
Call John, tell him not to let Mrs. Logan anywhere near the stage.

457
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,440
Yeah, give me Dr. Hill.

458
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,400
As I look back upon the deeds of David Palmer,

459
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,950
not only one of this country's greatest leaders,

460
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,050
but one of this world's greatest men...

461
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,290
- our nation grieves for its loss...  - Mrs. Logan...

462
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,640
Let go of me.

463
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,550
Let go of me!

464
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,470
- Let go!  - I can't let you...

465
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,460
... to President Palmer's entire family

466
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,110
and to them, I also pledge the full resources of this great nation

467
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,900
to find and to punish those responsible.

468
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,410
- No, no, no.  - Get away from me.

469
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,830
- I can't let you go out there.  - Don't... don't touch me.

470
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,890
Don't touch me.

471
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,960
Get away from me now

472
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,130
or I swear I will have your family eating dog food out of a can.

473
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,910
Martha, stop it!

474
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,010
Mike, damn it, I am the First Lady!

475
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,690
Tell your storm trooper to stay away from me!

476
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,030
I need to talk to my husband.

477
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,450
Martha, look...

478
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,890
he's in the middle of a press conference right now.

479
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,570
Hundreds of millions of people are watching him live.

480
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,430
What is it, Martha? What is so urgent?

481
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,800
Maybe I can help.

482
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,830
Tell Charles I want to see him when he's done.

483
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,720
All right.

484
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,230
Don't shoot me.

485
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,930
What the hell are you doing here?

486
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,840
I'm sorry I followed you. I'm just...

487
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,460
I'm just worried about my mother.

488
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:11,840
Get up.

489
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,240
Get up.

490
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,230
Get up!

491
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,660
Damn it!

492
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,550
Come here, you're going with me.

493
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,000
This is none of my business.

494
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,840
This is none of my business, I won't tell anyone.

495
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,260
Just let me go, okay?

496
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,630
I really wish I could, kid, but I can't.

497
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,780
You're going with me.

498
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,070
Now get in the helicopter.

499
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,990
Frank, Frank, come on, please.

500
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,530
Move!

501
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,920
Prep a sterile cranial field.

502
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,850
I need access to the right hemisphere.

503
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,720
Right away.

504
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,800
I need to talk to Tony before he goes into surgery.

505
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,090
He's non responsive.

506
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,700
According to the paramedic on the chopper,

507
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,740
he suffered a closed head trauma that's affected his speech.

508
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,240
They're going to try to insert a stint to relieve the pressure.

509
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,470
Will he be able to talk then?

510
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,150
The doctor doesn't know.

511
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,670
I want real time updates on his progress.

512
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,730
We need Tony to explain this.

513
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,420
What is it?

514
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,990
I may have found a connection between Tony and David Palmer.

515
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,190
Tony's phone records?

516
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,290
One call in particular.

517
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,160
The last time Tony spoke to President Palmer was the day that Jack Bauer was killed.

518
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,000
Pull the transcripts?

519
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,300
I tried, but the files were corrupted.

520
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,600
What's he hiding?

521
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,020
Something about Jack's death.

522
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,970
Are you kidnapping me?

523
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,140
No!

524
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,260
Then where are you taking me?

525
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,520
Los Angeles.

526
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,600
Why?

527
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,240
Because I couldn't leave you back there.

528
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,420
You'd have gone to the police and I couldn't let that happen.

529
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,450
But what is this about?

530
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,850
Who are you?

531
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,810
Someone who's not supposed to still be alive.

532
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,820
Like some kind of witness relocation thing?

533
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,710
Yeah, something like that.

534
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,710
So you were a criminal.

535
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,580
No.

536
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,020
Listen, Derek, the less you know about me, the better.

537
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,800
So what are you going to do with me?

538
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,330
Hello?

539
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,330
Diane, it's me.

540
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,920
Frank, I can just barely hear you.

541
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,780
What's that noise?

542
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,890
I'm in a helicopter with Derek.

543
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,760
Derek?

544
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,910
Yeah, he's fine.

545
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,540
Listen, Diane, I need you to pick him up in Los Angeles for me.

546
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,740
Why is he with you?

547
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,820
I'll explain everything as soon as I see you.

548
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,090
Frank, Frank, what are you doing with Derek?

549
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,620
Diane, please just do this for me.

550
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,740
I need you to get in a car and start driving now.

551
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,470
You're scaring me.

552
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,970
Diane, do you remember this morning

553
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,540
when you said that you trusted me?

554
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,980
Right now, I need you to trust me.

555
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
Derek's going to be fine. Just do what I say.

556
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,330
I need you to get in a car and start driving towards Los Angeles.

557
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,860
Don't talk to anybody about this.

558
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,890
And I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

559
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,200
Frank?

560
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,750
I don't understand,

561
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,990
you're just going to hand me back to my mom?

562
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,560
I thought you were worried about me going to the police.

563
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,110
I have something to do in Los Angeles.

564
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,750
Once it's done, it doesn't matter.

565
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,710
How are you doing?

566
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm sorry, Charles.

567
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,700
I didn't mean to make a scene.

568
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,920
I know that.

569
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,340
Dr. Hill says you haven't been taking your medication.

570
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,520
I don't like the way the pills make me feel.

571
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,750
Marty...

572
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,990
we just need to get through today.

573
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,070
Charles...

574
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,390
the reason that I needed to...

575
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,210
- needed to talk to you...  - what is it, honey?

576
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,200
Go ahead.

577
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,770
I think...

578
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,190
that David was killed because of something he was about to tell me.

579
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,130
Come on.

580
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,620
What are you talking about?

581
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,270
He called me yesterday.

582
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,610
He said he wanted to meet with me.

583
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,400
Meet with you about what?

584
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,910
He said it concerned national security and that it involved you.

585
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,840
- Me?  - Yes.

586
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,050
What else did he say?

587
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,520
Just that he would explain when he saw me.

588
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,530
If this was so important,

589
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,990
why wouldn't he have called me himself?

590
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,860
Well, Charles, you shut him out of this white house about 18 months ago.

591
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,780
You know that.

592
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,690
He had no real access.

593
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,890
Except through you.

594
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,220
You don't believe me.

595
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,380
I didn't say that.

596
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,640
You didn't need to.

597
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,160
Martha...

598
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,220
I am not making this up.

599
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,390
I am not crazy.

600
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,840
- I am not a fool, Charles!  - Martha...

601
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,360
it's going to be all right.

602
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,170
I'm not making this up.

603
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,700
All right.

604
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,820
I'll have Walt look into it.

605
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,610
You will?

606
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,790
Yes.

607
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,850
Thank you.

608
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,980
But right now...

609
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,630
President Suvarov and his wife are arriving in one hour.

610
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,460
I need you to be there.

611
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,780
I need you by my side.

612
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,080
I'm sorry.

613
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,500
Was she all right?

614
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,050
No, Walt, she's not all right.

615
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,110
She's having another one of her delusions.

616
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,800
She thinks that David Palmer was killed

617
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,650
because of something he was about to tell her.

618
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,420
She's imagining she's in the middle of one of her own conspiracy theories.

619
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,100
Well, what should we do?

620
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,660
Nothing.

621
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,180
Spenser, have you talked to Chloe this morning?

622
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,480
No, why?

623
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,070
She left her apartment about a half hour ago.

624
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,210
She should've been here by now.

625
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,380
It's probably traffic.

626
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,070
She commutes against traffic

627
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,040
and she's not answering her cell phone.

628
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,520
I wouldn't worry about it.

629
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,890
She sounded strange when I talked to her.

630
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,190
She always sounds strange.

631
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,200
I'm gonna call Adamson, have him run a locate on her cell.

632
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,410
Don't waste his time, Edgar, she's fine.

633
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,670
I'm sure of it.

634
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,490
- What makes you so sure?  - It doesn't matter.

635
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,620
It does to me.

636
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,240
I saw her, okay?

637
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,880
Uh, about half an hour ago.

638
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,000
- But I thought you said...  - Forget what I said.

639
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,410
- Where did you see her?  - Man...

640
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,720
do you really need me to spell it out for you?

641
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,070
Don't worry about Chloe.

642
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,850
She's fine, all right?

643
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,970
You can just let me out here.

644
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,820
There's nothing here.

645
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,080
Just pull over, please.

646
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,720
Why won't you talk to me, Frank.

647
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,500
Can you please tell me what's going on?

648
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,010
Please.

649
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,850
A friend of mine's in trouble.

650
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,560
I needed to pick her up in a hurry.

651
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,110
This is the only way I could get to her quick enough.

652
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,100
Chloe.

653
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,660
Jack!

654
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,870
- Are you okay?  - I'm fine!

655
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,300
What's happening?

656
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,060
Why would anyone want to kill the people who know you're alive?

657
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,050
I don't know yet, but we're gonna find out.

658
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,300
Right now, I need to get access to CTU's archives from a secure location.

659
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,740
Can you help me do that?

660
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,570
I can't do it from my laptop.

661
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,640
But there's a research loft at Cal Tech.

662
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,840
I can get us in.

663
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,720
Who's that?

664
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,460
I'll explain as soon as we're in the car.

665
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,640
I don't have a car, I took a cab.

666
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,090
Come on, get in the helicopter. We got to go.

667
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,000
Derek, get back in.

668
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,220
- Jack?  - What?

669
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,390
It's them.

670
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,010
How did they find me?

671
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,860
I don't think they ever lost you.

672
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,550
Come on.

673
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,030
What's going on, Frank?

674
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,080
Who are they?

675
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,710
What are we waiting for? Take off!

676
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,170
We're not at speed!

677
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,950
We're not gonna make it. Get out!

678
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,640
Get out now, and stay by the side of the helicopter!

679
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,200
Here! Take him and go into the refinery!

680
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,790
Find somewhere to hide! Move!

681
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,220
I can't see a thing.

682
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,720
Double back, cut him off.

683
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,240
Go through the smoke screen, I'm going around.

684
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,490
Go over here.

685
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,320
Hold your fire, Chloe!

686
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,300
Jack, what are you doing? Let's get out of here.

687
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,020
Chloe, take Derek and walk away.

688
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,190
Walk away now!

689
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,210
At the rate you're bleeding out,

690
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,570
you're not gonna make it unless you get medical attention.

691
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,950
You tell me what I want to know

692
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,160
and I will get you to a hospital, do you understand me?

693
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,390
Do you understand me?

694
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,560
Yeah.

695
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,600
Four people knew I was alive.

696
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,290
This morning, you tried to take them out.

697
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,290
Why?

698
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,050
Palmer was my primary target.

699
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,580
They only cared about Palmer.

700
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,110
The others were just a diversion...

701
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,090
to set you up, make it look like you did it.

702
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,160
Why'd they want to kill Palmer?

703
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,640
To keep him from talking.

704
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,950
They had to shut him up.

705
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,900
What'd he know?

706
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,890
I wasn't given that information.

707
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,160
Only hired...

708
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,180
to take out the principle.

709
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,140
You're the one that killed Palmer.

710
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,890
Yeah.

711
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,300
Who's behind this?

712
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,420
I got my orders through a code of silence.

713
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,540
We never use names, you know that.

714
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,100
That's all I know. Take me to a hospital.

715
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


716
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,600
What's going on?

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,100
What do you mean?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,100
I'm your brother.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,600
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,800
It's all right, really.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,300
Okay.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
One more chapter and we'll take a break.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,500
David.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,500
Get help!

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,000
Whoever did this,

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,100
I want them dead or in custody by the time the Russians get here.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,700
I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty, sir.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,300
No.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,900
Absolutely not.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,400
I think...

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,300
that David was killed

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,500
because of something he was about to tell me.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,200
He said that it concernednational security

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,000
and that it involved you.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,000
Was she all right?

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,000
No, Walt, she's not all right.

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,700
She's having another one of her delusions.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,800
What is this, an interrogation?

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,400
I just don't like being lied to.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,500
No one's lying to you, Derek.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,100
Sorry.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
You don't owe me an explanation.

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,000
If you had wanted to tellme about your past,

30
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,000
you would have told me already.

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,200
Yeah?

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
Jack, I know this isn't protocol.

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,900
Please don't hang up on me.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,800
I need your help.

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,100
They got Tony and Michele.

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,800
Michele is dead.

37
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,900
Tony's in criticalondition.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,900
Now they're gonna kill me.

39
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,000
What the hell are you doing here?

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,400
I'm sorry I followed you.

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm just...

42
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm just worried about my mother.

43
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,600
You're going with me.

44
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,600
Hold your fire, Chloe!

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Palmer was my primary target.

46
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Set you up.

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Make it look like you did it.

48
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,800
You're the one that killed Palmer.

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,900
Yeah.

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,100
The President's retreat is still vulnerable.

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
You need to post two more people here at Delta.

52
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
It's a high probability point of infiltration.

53
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,700
We'll have to pull assets from somewhere else.

54
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, Marcie, hi,

55
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,000
can you give me the figures?

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,700
Excuse me, sir.

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Sorry to interrupt.

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,400
What is it, Edgar?

59
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
We have a visual on a suspect.

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,900
I thought you might want to know.

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
He may be the Palmer shooter.

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Were you able to make an ID?

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,500
I think you should see for yourself.

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
About an hour before President Palmer was shot...

65
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,800
someone broke into the service entrance of the building across the street,

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
the one the sniper used.

67
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,900
We have a frame grab from a security video.

68
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,100
I ran it through a high-res filter,

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
so it may take a few seconds to render.

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,700
Audrey.

71
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,200
What is going on here, Jack?

72
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,300
They're setting me up to take the fall for Palmer's assassination.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
Palmer's not even president anymore.

74
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,400
Why would they want him dead?

75
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,100
I don't know.

76
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,400
You need to get as far away from here as you can.

77
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,400
Just disappear.

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
No, what I need to do is I need to find out

79
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,500
who really killed President Palmer.

80
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,800
How are you gonna do that?

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,000
Start at the beginning.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
Investigate the original crime scene.

83
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,000
David Palmer was visiting his brother when he was shot.

84
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Maybe he left something there that can help me.

85
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,900
That's crazy.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,300
Palmer was assassinated an hour ago.

87
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,600
The place is gonna be crawling with Secret Service, FBI, local police.

88
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,300
I need access to a building schematic

89
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,900
and an interagency deployment grid.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Can you get that for me or not?

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Yeah.

92
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,600
I should be able to log on remotely from the site.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,500
Okay.

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,900
Come on, let's go.

95
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,600
How could you kill that guy?

96
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,200
I'm sorry you had to see that, Derek.

97
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,300
Get in the van.

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,700
I'm not going anywhere with you.

99
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,700
You're gonna do exactly what I tell you

100
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,100
until I pass you off to your mother.

101
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,100
Let go of me.

102
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,600
Let's get something straight, kid.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
The only reason you're still conscious is

104
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,900
because I don't want to carry you.

105
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,300
Now get in the van.

106
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,700
Preliminary analysis indicates the video hasn't been doctored.

107
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,900
Then Jack was in the building the sniper fired

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,200
from at the same time President Palmer was assassinated.

109
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,100
That's impossible.

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
This whole thing is impossible.

111
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,800
Bill, you were there when Jack was shot.

112
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,800
He had not pulse, no vitals.

113
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,400
And I have no idea how Jack staged his own death.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,400
But I understand his reasons.

115
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,900
He was about to be handed over to the Chinese government to spend the rest of his life in prison.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,900
None of that explains why Jack would want to kill David Palmer.

117
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,600
I had Curtis pull the phone logs.

118
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,400
Palmer, Tony and Michelle were all talking to Jack right before he was supposedly killed.

119
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,600
Our working theory is that they conspired to help Jack fake his own death.

120
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,500
Now you're saying that

121
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,900
Jack was behind the attack on Tony and Michelle, too?

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
Why would Jack want to kill the people who helped him?

123
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,000
Something may happened

124
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,700
and he stopped trusting them to keep his secret.

125
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,800
Jack would never murder his friends.

126
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,600
Audrey...

127
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't want to believe Jack did this either.

128
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,000
But right now, it's the best explanation for the evidence that we have.

129
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,900
The White House needs to know about this.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,200
Yeah, I'll call the President.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,500
Bill.

133
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,900
What is it, Curtis?

134
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I had Adamson run a data recovery operation on Tony's phone records.

135
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,700
They show Chloe was on those calls with President Palmer and Tony.

136
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,800
Chloe knew Jack was alive?

137
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,300
Apparently.

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,300
We called her in an hour ago,

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,500
she should have been here by now.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
I've been trying to call her on her cell,

141
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,000
but she's not answering.

142
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,700
I wanted to run a locate but Spencer talked me out of it.

143
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,000
- If anything happens to her it's your fault.  - Stop.

144
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,500
Have Adamson track her cell,

145
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,300
we need to get to her before Jack does.

146
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,300
Put out an interagency alert.

147
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Jack Bauer is now the prime suspect in President Palmer's assassination.

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,300
Emphasize that he's a former agent,

149
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,800
well trained and should be considered extremely dangerous.

150
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,800
Excuse me, sir.

151
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,300
What is it, Walt?

152
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,400
Mrs. Logan called again.

153
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,400
I can't keep putting her off about this phone call with David Palmer.

154
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,400
Why would David Palmer call my wife about a national security threat?

155
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,700
That's what she says he wanted to talk to her about.

156
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
A matter of national security.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Maybe if I investigated the phone call?

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,900
No, you need to stay focused on the Summit.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,700
I am, sir.

160
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
Which is why we can't risk having Mrs. Logan obsess about this phone call.

161
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,500
Showing her the truth might help her get on with her responsibilities today.

162
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,600
So what are you...

163
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,600
what are you suggesting?

164
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, if David Palmer called her yesterday,

165
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,900
our communications office will have a recording of their conversation.

166
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,000
Get that for me.

167
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,300
Yes, sir.

168
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,100
And Walt...

169
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
thank you for doing this.

170
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Mr. President,

171
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,000
Audrey Raines is holding on line three.

172
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,300
Miss. Raines, this is President Logan.

173
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
You're also on with Walt Cummings.

174
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,500
Sir, CTU has a suspect in the assassination of President Palmer.

175
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,400
Good!

176
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,000
Who is it?

177
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Miss. Raines?

178
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
It's Jack Bauer, sir.

179
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Jack Bauer's dead.

180
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,100
We've all been living under that assumption, sir.

181
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,100
I don't understand.

182
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,400
What makes you think it's Bauer?

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,900
CTU has verified surveillance video placing Jack Bauer at the same time

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,700
in the same building as the sniper who killed President Palmer.

185
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,900
Audrey, this is Walt Cummings.

186
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Let me get clear on this.

187
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,300
Are you saying that Bauer shot David Palmer?

188
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,500
We're proceeding under that assumption, yes.

189
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,400
Why? For what possible reason?

190
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,000
David Palmer might have known that Jack Bauer was alive,

191
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,600
knowledge that he shared with three other CTU agents,

192
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
all of whom have been targeted in the last hour.

193
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
The man does have a history of insubordination,

194
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,900
irrational behavior, drug addiction.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Jack Bauer has a history of great service to this country.

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,900
How does this affect your threat assessment for the Summit?

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,200
We're still recommending that you delay or reschedule

198
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,900
until Jack Bauer's apprehended.

199
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,400
Miss. Raines, you have a suspect.

200
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Find him.

201
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,700
Yes, sir.

202
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,800
Sir, President Suvarov arrives within the hour.

203
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Should we think about informing his security chief that he's a potential target?

204
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
No, no.

205
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,400
I... I want this information limited to those involved in the man hunt for Jack Bauer.

206
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,800
Understood?

207
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,100
Yes, sir.

208
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,100
I found Haas.

209
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
He and his men are all dead.

210
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,200
How did this happen?

211
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm not sure.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The last time I spoke to Haas,

213
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
he was about to move on Bauer and the woman.

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
Is there any sign of Bauer now?

215
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,200
No.

216
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,700
I'll dispatch a team and track him.

217
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,100
We'll have him in 24 hours.

218
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,800
No, let CTU find Bauer.

219
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,000
Once they have him in custody,

220
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,000
we'll take him out.

221
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,700
You're not concerned Bauer will impede the operation?

222
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
He won't have chance.

223
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
We launch in less than an hour.

224
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,100
All of their hardware's military spec,

225
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,300
fragmentation grenades, percussion grenades.

226
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,100
Here's a communit we can use.

227
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,600
Who are these people?

228
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah?

229
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,800
Frank.

230
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,100
Will you please tell me what's going on?

231
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Diane, I know it's hard,

232
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
but please try not to worry.

233
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,500
Derek is fine.

234
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Where are you now?

235
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,900
Um, I'm... I'm about a half hour outside of L.A.

236
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Just tell me where to meet you.

237
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,200
I don't know yet.

238
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Just keep heading towards the city.

239
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,200
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

240
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,500
Can I talk to him?

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
Of course, hold on.

242
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,000
It's your mother.

243
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,800
Talk to her.

244
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,600
Mom?

245
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,600
Derek.

246
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,000
Are you okay?

247
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Yeah, I'm all right.

248
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,200
Are you sure?

249
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,600
Jack, we're about a block away.

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Say goodbye to your mother.

251
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,700
I have to hang up now, Mom.

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Don't worry.

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
Derek, I love you.

254
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,700
Me, too.

255
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,400
Give me the phone.

256
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Get to the back of the vehicle.

257
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,400
Go!

258
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,900
While security agencies are remaining hushed,

259
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,500
speculation begins to grow.

260
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,200
We're told though

261
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,400
that that speculation will not be addressed

262
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,100
because the government says security right now is of utmost importance.

263
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,100
Now, look behind me,

264
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,900
you'll see the Los Angeles apartment building

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
where President David Palmer was assassinated a little more than an hour ago.

266
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,400
You can also see Americans of all ages have started to gather to mourn

267
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,600
and pay their last respects to the beloved former president

268
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,700
who surprised many almost three years ago with his 11th-hour announcement

269
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,000
that he would not be seeking second term.

270
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,400
All right, go ahead though.

271
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,800
Let her through.

272
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,800
We're clear.

273
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,000
Go on up front.

274
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Hold the light on the bag.

275
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,300
Can you get a wireless access point from down here?

276
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,900
Yeah, I'm reading the agents' transponders.

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,100
I can track their locations to within three feet.

278
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,900
Jack, there are 167 agents in and around the location,

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
25 of them in Wayne Palmer apartment alone.

280
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,300
I know.

281
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,300
That's why we better hope

282
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,600
that this is gonna be the last place they're gonna be looking for me.

283
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,500
Testing one, two.

284
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,900
Testing one, two, three.

285
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,100
Okay.

286
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,400
This is field ops communication unit.

287
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
All you need to do is put it in your ear and we're set to go.

288
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,500
Derek, put out the light.

289
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,000
Officer.

290
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,300
I live in this building.

291
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,200
I was told that...

292
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,900
- What...  - Relax.

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He's really good at this.

294
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,800
You sure he's okay?

295
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,600
Yeah.

296
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,400
I think.

297
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,300
All right, do you copy?

298
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,400
Yeah.

299
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,400
Wayne Palmer's apartment is the penthouse.

300
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,300
I'm going up now.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,700
Jack, there are four agents waiting at the lobby.

302
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,200
Hold off on going up if you can.

303
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,600
Too late.

304
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm entering the apartment.

305
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Most of the agents are in the living room.

306
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,900
That must be where Palmer was shot.

307
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,300
There are two rooms to the north, 15 feet.

308
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Probably bedrooms.

309
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,900
They're clear, no agents.

310
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,800
This first room is a study.

311
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,900
Let me know if anyone comes this way.

312
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,900
We'll do, Jack.

313
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,300
You keep calling him Jack.

314
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,100
He told my mother and I his name's Frank.

315
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,600
Who is he, really?

316
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
His name's Jack Bauer.

317
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Up until a year and a half ago,

318
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
he worked for the government.

319
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,800
Is that why we're in the building where the President was killed?

320
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
Please don't ask me any more questions.

321
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,800
Can't you at least tell me

322
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
why he had to pretend he was someone else?

323
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
Certain people thought the best way

324
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,300
to cover up their mistakes was to get rid of Jack.

325
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,500
You mean, kill him?

326
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,300
Yes.

327
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Jack had to give up everything and everyone in his life,

328
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
including his daughter.

329
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,100
He has a daughter?

330
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,900
I've already told you more than I should.

331
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,300
Chloe, I have the computer in the study booted up.

332
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,800
President Palmer had a user account.

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,100
Is it password secured?

334
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,000
No, there are about a dozen files,

335
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
only one of them's encrypted.

336
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,100
That's where I'm gonna look.

337
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay, give me the computer's IP address.

338
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll upload a decryption program to it.

339
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,900
Hold on.

340
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,900
2 9 2 dot 1 6...

341
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,100
2 dot 1 2 dot 2.

342
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,400
Someone's at the door.

343
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,800
Not according to the deployment grid.

344
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,000
There are no agents there.

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,600
Do not move.

346
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,600
Do not raise your voice.

347
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,400
You son of a bitch.

348
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,000
You killed my brother.

349
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,900
Mr. Palmer, you know I didn't do that.

350
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,500
Whatever evidence they showed you against me has been fabricated.

351
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
I served your brother for years.

352
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,200
I would've gladly given my life for his.

353
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,500
He was my friend.

354
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,000
The only reason that I am here

355
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
is to try and figure out why

356
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,300
and how he was assassinated.

357
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
I was hoping to find clues on that computer.

358
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,900
Why don't you step into the next room, Jack,

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
and ask the Secret Service to help you find it?

360
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Because I'm being set up.

361
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Whoever's behind this has planted evidence against me making me the shooter.

362
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,800
It would be useless to try and convince the authorities otherwise.

363
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,200
You think you're gonna convince me?

364
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If I killed your brother,

365
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,900
why didn't I kill you

366
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
when you walked through the door?

367
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,300
Think about this, Wayne.

368
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Why would I be here?

369
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,900
Please... I need your help.

370
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Jack, how do you expect me to believe you under these circumstances?

371
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,100
Take the gun.

372
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,800
Jack, what are you doing?

373
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,100
Take the gun.

374
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,800
MAN That after two terms in the House

375
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,100
and one in the Senate,

376
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,300
David Palmer was elected president...

377
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,800
There you are, Mrs. Logan.

378
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
David and I first got to know each other

379
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,300
when he was elected to Congress.

380
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
He and Charles never saw eye to eye politically, but...

381
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
David never let that get in the way of our friendship.

382
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,800
Oh...

383
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,800
that picture's from his inauguration.

384
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,100
At the ball,

385
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,700
I was one of the first people David asked to dance.

386
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,100
Mrs. Logan, I need a few more minutes with your hair...

387
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,700
I know! I can do it myself.

388
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,300
Just trying to help.

389
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
Um, I'm sorry, Evelyn, I know.

390
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,700
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,700
Mrs. Logan.

392
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,500
May I... have a word?

393
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,300
Of course.

394
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,400
The President asked me to look into the call from David Palmer that you

395
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,100
told him about.

396
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,200
I was beginning to think you were ignoring me.

397
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,200
So when did this call take place?

398
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,300
Last night.

399
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,300
It woke me up.

400
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
I had fallen asleep watching the news,

401
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
so it was somewhere between 10:00 and 11:00.

402
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,800
Well, I'll have someone pull up the call from the audio archives.

403
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,900
Walt.

404
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,700
He doesn't believe me, does he?

405
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,800
Charles.

406
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,100
He thinks I'm making the whole thing up.

407
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,900
I wouldn't say that, Mrs. Logan.

408
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, of course you wouldn't say it.

409
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,200
Mrs. Logan...

410
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,800
Walt, you can go now.

411
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,700
He leaves behind a son and daughter

412
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
as well as a shocked and grieving nation.

413
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,600
David Palmer, dead today at age 55.

414
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,000
Your brother say or do anything out of the ordinary before he was shot?

415
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,600
He was acting distracted ever since he came to Los Angeles.

416
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,700
I finally called him on it this morning.

417
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,000
What'd he say?

418
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,000
He never had the chance to say anything, Jack.

419
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,600
The decryption program's finished running.

420
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,000
You should be able to open the file.

421
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,400
Okay, I'm going into it now.

422
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,600
That's the first chapter of his memoir.

423
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,100
That doesn't make any sense.

424
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,400
Why would he encrypt that?

425
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,500
I mean, there are printouts of it all over the place.

426
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,300
Maybe he hid some information in the document.

427
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,900
We're gonna have to compare this to the printout.

428
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,800
See if he added or changed anything.

429
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Got one right here.

430
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,100
You haven't sent the file allocations.

431
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,000
What's the problem?

432
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,300
I need a higher level access code.

433
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,100
Look, you're still upset about me and Chloe.

434
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,100
I don't care about that.

435
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,100
I care that if you hadn't left her on her own this morning.

436
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,400
Maybe she'd be okay right now.

437
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,500
Don't you think I know that?

438
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,000
Look, you're just making it harder for me to do my job.

439
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Use Chloe's access code, JJ72.

440
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,300
You won't get fire walled with it.

441
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,700
Thank you.

442
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,200
- Edgar.  - What?

443
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,100
This is weird.

444
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,400
I tried logging in under Chloe's access code.

445
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,200
The system says I'm already signed in.

446
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,900
Let me see.

447
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,100
That's because Chloe's logged in remotely.

448
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,500
Are you sure it's her?

449
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,100
Yes.

450
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,700
See the way the traffic's redirected through an external socket?

451
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,300
Even I don't know how to do that.

452
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,000
Then she's alive.

453
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,860
Buchanan.

454
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,890
Sir, it's Edgar, I think we can find Chloe.

455
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,640
How?

456
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,110
She's accessing our system through a laptop, I'm running a locate now.

457
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,090
What's she using our system to do?

458
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,310
All I can see from here

459
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,060
is she's tracking Secret Service and FBI deployments.

460
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,650
The locate came back.

461
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,270
She's at Wayne Palmer's building.

462
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,170
The signal's faint.

463
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,750
It's possible she's in the parking garage under the building.

464
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,020
Let me know if she changes location.

465
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,520
Why would Chloe be at the scene of Palmer's assassination, tracking agents?

466
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,680
She wouldn't be... unless someone was forcing her.

467
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,610
What do you mean?

468
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,090
Maybe Jack left evidence behind he needs to erase.

469
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,800
Surrounded by all of those agents? Bill, that doesn't make sense.

470
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,030
Jack can explain it to us when we apprehend him.

471
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,260
This is Bill Buchanan at CTU.

472
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,450
I need to speak to the Secret Service field director immediately.

473
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,230
Yes.

474
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,370
Have you left yet?

475
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,070
No, we were delayed, we're still loading the truck.

476
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,680
You should be on your way by now.

477
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,880
Be there in 20 minutes, as planned.

478
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,150
Call me when you're approaching.

479
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,300
Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop.

480
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,520
Right there.

481
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,260
He added something in the middle of a sentence.

482
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,230
A name and an address.

483
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,530
There.

484
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,210
Chevensky 16 Transport Way.

485
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,330
Chloe, did you get that? It looks like an address.

486
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,990
Yes, Transport Way is a street at the Ontario Airport.

487
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,340
Okay, I want you to check all inbound flights into Ontario.

488
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,170
Look for a passenger Chevensky. Try and make the connection.

489
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,230
Jack, the Secret Service is changing its deployment.

490
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,950
How?

491
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,280
Suddenly, there are a lot of agents moving into the building.

492
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,860
I'm on my way down.

493
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,580
They know that I'm here.

494
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,550
Let me help you out of here, Jack.

495
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,930
No.

496
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,920
You can't risk being connected to me

497
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
and until we know who to trust,

498
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,520
you can't tell anybody about what we found, do you understand?

499
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,100
I'm going to do everything I can to find out who did this to your brother.

500
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,670
I'll be in touch.

501
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,970
Chloe, I need another way out of here.

502
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,260
Checking.

503
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,760
Jack, across the hall, through the kitchen.

504
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,260
One agent at the door.

505
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,050
Copy that.

506
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,120
I'm in the elevator.

507
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,190
Where are they concentrating their agents?

508
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,650
Jack, they cut off access to my grid, I don't know where the agents are.

509
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,830
They were grouping in the lobby.

510
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,320
I'm getting out on the second floor.

511
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,230
Come on, Jack.

512
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,970
What'd you get for me on Chevensky?

513
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,140
He's not a passenger, he's a baggage supervisor at the airport.

514
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,920
Jack Bauer!

515
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,680
Agent O'Brian!

516
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,460
The perimeter is sealed! There is no way out!

517
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,490
Step into view with your hands in the air!

518
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,300
We know you're down here!

519
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,890
Step into view with you hands in the air!

520
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,120
We got a visual!

521
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,520
Do not shoot! We need them alive!

522
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,050
No one fire!

523
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,380
No one fire!

524
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,120
Do not fire!

525
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,050
Step out of the vehicle!

526
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,300
Check the back! Get the side!

527
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,230
Step to your left! Get down on your knees!

528
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,800
Cuff her!

529
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,340
Open the back!

530
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,300
Bauer's not here. Secure the area.

531
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,790
Get in!

532
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,540
Give me my bag!

533
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,110
Come on.

534
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,870
Got it.

535
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,910
Frank.

536
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,890
Yeah, it's me.

537
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,650
Listen, Derek is all right, I just need to know where you are.

538
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,720
I'm on the 210 at the 10.

539
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,610
Okay, I want you to take the 10 East to the Ontario Airport.

540
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,600
When you get there, I want you to go to the parking lot in front of the terminal.

541
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,360
I'll meet you on the west side of that parking lot, do you understand me?

542
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,010
Yeah, yeah.

543
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,990
Diane, listen to me.

544
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,800
I am so sorry that I got you involved in this.

545
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,070
But everything's gonna be all right, I'll be there in a few minutes, okay?

546
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,640
Okay.

547
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,460
Okay, thanks.

548
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,860
Mr. Buchanan, this is Agent Jennings.

549
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,970
There's no sign of Jack Bauer yet, but we've apprehended your agent, Chloe O'Brian.

550
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,760
She was trying to escape our agents and get away from the building.

551
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,300
You're telling me she wasn't under duress?

552
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,240
Not as far as I can tell.

553
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,860
Put her on the phone.

554
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,080
Uncuff her.

555
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,750
Bill Buchanan wants to talk to you.

556
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,480
Hi.

557
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,240
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

558
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,290
Jack didn't kill anybody.

559
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,330
He's being framed to cover up the real reason Palmer was assassinated.

560
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,450
This is according to Jack.

561
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,930
This is according to the man who killed Palmer, I heard his dying confession.

562
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,950
You'll find his body at the refinery, just north of the city at Variel and Topanga.

563
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,410
Chloe, do you have evidence that Palmer's assassination has anything to do with the Summit?

564
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,230
No, Jack's trying to figure all that out.

565
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,960
How? Where is he?

566
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,920
I can't tell you.

567
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,970
Why not?

568
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,370
Because I don't think you believe him, I think you're just trying to arrest him.

569
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,650
Chloe, I'm not going to ask you again.

570
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,460
I'm ordering you to tell me where Jack is.

571
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,070
I'm sorry, I'd like to tell you, but I can't.

572
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,610
Chloe!

573
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,210
Sir?

574
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,090
Bring her back to CTU.

575
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,370
Curtis, keep a team to the refinery. See what you can find there.

576
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,760
Edgar, make sure Chloe goes into a holding cell when she gets back.

577
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,660
That woman, Chloe...

578
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,670
she told me some stuff about what you used to do.

579
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,730
Yeah, well, she shouldn't have.

580
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,630
Why did you have to lie?

581
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,240
Couldn't you have just told us the truth?

582
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,770
First of all, Derek,

583
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,800
you have to understand that I never thought anything like this could ever happen.

584
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,340
After your mother rented me that room,

585
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,170
I started to remember what it was like to have a family.

586
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,690
How nice it was.

587
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,790
I started to believe that a guy like me could actually get a second chance.

588
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,880
I know you don't believe this now...

589
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,950
but I really do care about you

590
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,890
and I care about your mother.

591
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,980
I hope one day, you can understand that.

592
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,190
Charles?

593
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,720
Evelyn said you wanted to talk to me?

594
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,880
I do.

595
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,530
Did Walt find the tape of the phone call?

596
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,690
I told him approximately when it took place.

597
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,670
Why don't we sit down?

598
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,210
No, I don't want to sit down.

599
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,640
All right.

600
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,830
You don't need to be concerned that there's any connection

601
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,050
between David's death and the phone call he made to you.

602
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,370
He said it was a matter of national security, those were his exact words.

603
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,270
There's got to be a connection, of course.

604
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,040
There isn't.

605
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,130
David was killed by an unstable ex-CTU agent.

606
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,510
This was not a conspiracy, this was one man acting out some kind of grudge.

607
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,430
Did you hear the call?

608
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,030
Marty, can we just drop this?

609
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,740
Did you or didn't you hear it?

610
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,580
Martha.

611
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,920
It's David Palmer, did I wake you?

612
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,980
No, no, David, not at all, what's going on?

613
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,560
I need to talk to you.

614
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,130
It's hardly a matter of national security,

615
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,230
but I'm hosting a charity dinner next month

616
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,350
for the Art in Action Scholarship Program.

617
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,070
- That sounds wonderful.  - No, that's not what he said.

618
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,740
- No, that's not what he said.  - I would very much like you and the President to be there.

619
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,590
That is not it, that is not it,

620
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,610
Charles, that's not it.

621
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,770
Thanks so much for calling, let me...

622
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,370
Martha, listen!

623
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,490
Thank you, Martha.

624
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,140
Of course.

625
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,960
- Please send the President my best.  - No, that's not...

626
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,390
- that's not what he said.  - Yes, it is.

627
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,110
No, that is... that is a trick.

628
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,700
- Listen to me...  - I am not crazy.

629
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,580
- Marty... Martha!  - I know what I heard!

630
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,620
- listen to me  - I know what I heard.

631
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,120
I spoke to Dr. Hill.

632
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,840
He said if you were not consistent with your medication,

633
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,650
you could become disoriented.

634
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Your memory can be affected.

635
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:47,830
He aid that?

636
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,280
Yes!

637
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,800
That's why you remember something different.

638
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,590
I know you don't like how these pills make you feel,

639
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,830
but you need to take them.

640
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,050
If Jack was responsible for President Palmer's assassination,

641
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,620
why would Chloe cover for him? It just doesn't make sense.

642
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,320
There's something else going on here and we're missing it.

643
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,090
NSA just intercepted some chatter identifying the Summit as a target.

644
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,460
We're sourcing it now,

645
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,650
but the reliability is approaching 95 per cent.

646
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,600
Is there a time frame?

647
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,580
Within the next 15 minutes.

648
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,920
That's when the Russian president is scheduled to land.

649
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,510
President Logan said he will not postpone this summit.

650
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,480
In light of this, he may not have a choice.

651
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,320
Put me through to Mike Novick.

652
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,020
I'm watching Suvarov's helicopter leave the airbase.

653
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,260
His arrival at the retreat is on schedule.

654
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,260
As are we.

655
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,730
We'll go dark now.

656
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,720
No communication until after you strike.

657
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,750
I will monitor your progress from here.

658
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,090
Understood.

659
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,460
Mr. President?

660
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,480
Yeah, Mike, what is it?

661
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:14,150
CTU has confirmed intelligence suggesting President Suvarov's helicopter will be targeted.

662
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,610
How good is this intelligence?

663
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,430
Very good.

664
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,720
They're updating their recommendation that you delay or reschedule.

665
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,470
No, I've told them, I'm telling you.

666
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,840
I will not postpone this summit!

667
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,660
Then at least have Suvarov alter his arrival plan.

668
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,230
His chopper can land at a different site and he can be brought here by motorcade.

669
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,270
The risk would be substantially reduced.

670
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,060
And the impact of his arrival would also be reduced.

671
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,970
I've got the media waiting for a landing five minutes from now!

672
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,150
- Mr. President...  - I don't want to hear it, Walt.

673
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,020
It's up to Secret Service and the Air Force to protect our airspace!

674
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,530
Make sure they do the job.

675
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,090
There's your mom.

676
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,290
Hey.

677
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,060
I'm sorry about the way I treated you erlier.

678
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,070
You're a good kid.

679
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,410
Go get your mom.

680
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,020
Mom.

681
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,460
Oh, my God!

682
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,730
Oh, are you okay?

683
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,510
I was so worried!

684
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,350
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:58,080
You got to tell me right now what the hell is going on here, Frank.

686
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,570
My name's not Frank.

687
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,210
It's Jack Bauer.

688
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,460
I lied to you.

689
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,810
I lied to you about a lot of things.

690
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,950
I'll explain as soon as I can, but right now,

691
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,510
you and Derek need to go to this address.

692
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,300
CTU?

693
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,500
Counterterrorist Unit, I used to work there.

694
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,060
You need to ask for a man named Bill Buchanan. Tell him I sent you.

695
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,030
I'm sorry.

696
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,160
I have to go.

697
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,980
When we get there, what do we tell him?

698
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,100
Tell him the truth.

699
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,780
Where can I find the Baggage Claim Supervisor?

700
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,030
Down that hall to the left.

701
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,610
Thank you.

702
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,460
DOD is still giving us the all clear on the air space and the retreat.

703
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,670
Any word from our agents on the ground?

704
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,700
Okay.

705
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,250
I'm all quiet so far.

706
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,350
But if they're going to attack the helicopter, it's going to be now.

707
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,800
Hi, Mr. President...

708
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,130
Our intel must have been wrong.

709
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,570
Mom, do you see those men?

710
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,390
Yeah.

711
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,880
That's where Jack went.

712
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,170
Something's wrong.

713
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,730
I have to warn Jack.

714
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,810
Derek, where are you going?

715
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,170
Come back here! Derek! Come back here!

716
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,830
Derek!

717
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,400
Come back here!

718
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,630
Wait!

719
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,560
- I've got to get my son!  - No! You...

720
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,670
Get off! You can't...

721
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,310
- Please move your car.  - I've got to get my son.

722
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,290
- Derek!  - Get back in!

723
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,040
Chevensky!

724
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,070
- Why was President Palmer killed?  - I don't know what you're talking about.

725
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,110
You are going to tell me what I want to know.

726
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,180
It's just a question of how much you want it to hurt.

727
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,380
No!

728
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,680
Get on the gound!

729
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,550
Down!

730
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,600
Quiet!

731
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,080
Quiet!

732
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:56,470
You will not be harmed as long as your president complies with our wishes.

733
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,870
Derek!

734
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,640
Derek!

735
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,420
Madam, stop!

736
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,770
- I have to get my son!  - You need to go the other way.

737
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,510
- My son!  - Go the other way.

738
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,540
This is a dangerous situation, I have to get my son!

739
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,580
I have dealt with the Martha Logan situation.

740
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,360
She's not going to be a problem?

741
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,930
No, I was able to alter the tape of the phone call

742
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,600
before the President heard it.

743
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,260
There's no longer any evidence on my end

744
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,780
at Palmer was trying to warn her about the attack.

745
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,650
Good.

746
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,310
The terminal and the hostages are secure.

747
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,650
It'll only be a matter of time until the President is notified of the demands.
﻿1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,810
Now, why would David Palmer call my wife about a national security threat?

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,510
Can't risk having Mrs. Logan obsess about this phone call.

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,760
David Palmer called her yesterday.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,330
Our communications office will have a recording of their conversation.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,570
Get that for me.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,240
You don't need to be concerned that there's any connection

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,990
between David's death and the phone call he made to you.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,410
He said it was a matter of national security.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,210
Those were his exact words.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,280
Martha, it's David Palmer.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,030
I need to talk to you.

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,080
It's hardly a matter of national security.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,380
No, that's not what he said, that is not what he said!

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,980
Yes, it is.

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,200
I have dealt with the Martha Logan situation.

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,530
I was able to alter the tape of the phone call before the President heard it.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,980
There's no longer any evidence on my end that Palmer was trying to warn her about the attack.

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,540
Sir, it's Edgar, I think we can find Chloe.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,510
She's accessing our system through a laptop.

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,270
I'm running a locate now.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,890
What'd you get for me on Chevensky?

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,250
He's a baggage supervisor at the airport.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,950
Jack Bauer! Agent O'brian!

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,000
We know you're down here!

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,110
Don't fire!

26
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,930
Do not fire!

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,540
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,530
Jack didn't kill anybody.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,350
He's being framed to cover up the real reason Palmer was assassinated.

30
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,260
Where is he?

31
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,390
I can't tell you.

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,150
Where can I find the Baggage Claim Supervisor?

33
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,350
- Down that hall to the left.  - Thank you.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,660
Chevensky!

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,790
Why was President Palmer killed?

36
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,100
You are going to tell me what I want to know.

38
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,510
It's just a question of how much you want it to hurt.

39
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,920
Mom, do you see those men?

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,980
I have to warn Jack.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,130
Derek, where are you going?

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,370
Come back here!

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,120
No!

44
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,430
Quiet!

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,810
Quiet!

46
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,700
You will not be harmed as long as your president complies with our wishes!

47
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,970
We have a critical incident in progress!

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,070
I want a facility lock down and a code five evac, right now!

49
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,590
Clear the area! Madam...

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,330
Officer, my son is in there.

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,090
I'm sorry, madam, we're evacuating the area.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,170
Follow these people.

53
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,320
Madam!

54
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,560
- Grab her!  - Yes, sir!

55
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,460
I have to get my son!

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,380
Sorry, lady, I'm sorry, you can't stay.

57
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,630
I have information for CTU!

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,750
My son is in there!

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,980
Everyone, quiet!

60
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,260
Do not move.

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,770
If you cooperate,

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,870
you have a chance of leaving this building alive.

63
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,270
If not, you will die.

64
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,120
Do you understand?

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,440
Take out all cell phones and pagers and drop them on the floor.

66
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,660
We're going to be okay.

67
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,280
Bring them in.

68
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,210
Everyone up.

69
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,350
Move it.

70
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,460
Chevensky?

71
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,960
Chevensky?

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,600
Yeah.

73
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,760
Well?

74
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,740
Chevensky's not here.

75
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,110
We have to find him. Keep searching.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,480
Mcclaren.

77
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,120
Listen very carefully.

78
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,610
We have hostages.

79
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,900
If you wish to keep them alive,

80
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,000
you'll make no attempt to enter the terminal.

81
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,990
We are wearing explosive vests.

82
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,460
We are prepared to detonate ourselves along with our captives.

83
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,330
If you make any efforts to enter the terminal,

84
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,320
you will spend the rest of the day collecting body parts.

85
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,540
Hello?

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,850
Set up a security perimeter.

87
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,890
We'll operate from the northwest apron behind hangar 12

88
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,930
and get those fire trucks out of here!

89
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,510
Everybody out!

90
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,380
Claremont, grab that woman in the yellow next to bailey.

91
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,100
Bring her up here. Quick!

92
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,520
All right.

93
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,220
Yeah, thank you.

94
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,120
Bill, I just spoke to the Director of Secret Service.

95
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,640
Now that Suvarov has arrived safely.

96
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,170
They're lowering their security level by one.

97
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,800
I think we should do the same.

98
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,660
I'll take our Tac teams off stand by.

99
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,040
Have we heard back from our unit that was sent out to the refinery?

100
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
Yeah, at least that part of Chloe's story checked out.

101
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,250
So it's possible that Jack was set up in Palmer's assassination.

102
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,260
We can't assume too much.

103
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,620
Jack still has a lot to answer for.

104
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,470
Buchanan.

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,660
Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack Bauer on the line.

106
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,090
- Put it through.  - Yes, sir.

107
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,930
Bill, put it on speaker phone.

108
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,930
Please.

109
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,050
Jack, it's bill.

110
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,580
Bill, I'm in Ontario Airport.

111
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,760
Gunman have just attacked and taken over terminal one.

112
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,070
They are carrying automatic weapons and they have hostages.

113
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,790
We haven't received any alerts.

114
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,880
Trust me, you will.

115
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,670
What are you doing at the airport, Jack?

116
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,760
I was following up a lead.

117
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,140
President Palmer knew of the planned attack.

118
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,880
I believe that's why he was assassinated.

119
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,770
We just received an interagency flash.

120
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
There's been an attack on Ontario Airport.

121
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,990
First reports are of several men carrying automatic weapons

122
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,690
and they've taken control of terminal one.

123
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,000
Go to alert level four.

124
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,430
Launch all available tac teams.

125
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,620
Curtis is in the air.

126
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,110
Redirect him to the airport.

127
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,400
Have him maintain operational control the moment he's on site.

128
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,320
Right.

129
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,030
Jack, we just received confirmation of the situation.

130
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,650
I want you out of there now, Jack.

131
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,020
Turn yourself in.

132
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,340
Let our people handle this.

133
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,230
Understand this, Bill.

134
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,930
I don't work for you.

135
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,610
I'm staying inside.

136
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,240
You want my intel, fine,

137
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,260
but I'm doing this my way.

138
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,930
How many hostiles are there?

139
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,140
Approximately 15 to 20.

140
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,650
Gunmen have locked down the terminal.

141
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,420
I'm going to be sending you photos of the hostiles.

142
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,580
They should be clear enough that you can identify them, hold on.

143
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,130
Okay, they're transmitting.

144
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:07,750
All right, Jack.

145
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,490
We'll pull a schematic of the airport and forward it to your cell.

146
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,260
Bill, hold on, one more thing.

147
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,510
A woman is going to contact you, her name is Diane Huxley.

148
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,660
I sent her and her son to CTU for protection.

149
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,770
Who are they?

150
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,280
I don't have time to explain,

151
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,330
but I'm responsible for them.

152
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,010
Just make sure they're safe, okay?

153
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,330
We'll take care of them, Jack.

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,340
Thank you.

155
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,110
I'll be standing by.

156
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,040
We have to alert the President.

157
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,070
Right.

158
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,910
I'd like to personally extend my condolences on the loss your country has suffered today.

159
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,550
Thank you, Mr. President.

160
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,750
I hope that what you and I accomplish here today

161
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,330
will serve as a fitting tribute to David Palmer's legacy.

162
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,700
I can't imagine anything more appropriate than the two of us establishing

163
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,950
a... a comprehensive antiterrorism alliance between our nations.

164
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,150
If you would excuse me for a moment, Mr. President.

165
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,530
Of course.

166
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,680
What's up, Mike?

167
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,740
Terrorists are controlling the main terminal of Ontario Airport in Los Angeles.

168
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,490
Terrorists?

169
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,300
Yes, sir, there are eyewitness reports of two casualties

170
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,480
and they've taken hostages.

171
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,360
Who are they?

172
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
Unclear.

173
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,920
CTU in Los Angeles is prepping a briefing.

174
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,390
Mr. President.

175
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,220
I suggest we move to the situation room.

176
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,130
Now?

177
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,080
CTU thinks this may be related to the Summit.

178
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,670
Related in what way?

179
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,590
I don't know, sir,

180
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,440
but we'll find out during the briefing.

181
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,240
Sir?

182
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,290
We should go.

183
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,690
Of course.

184
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,560
Mr. President, as you've probably been made aware,

185
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,710
a situation has developed that requires my immediate attention.

186
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,550
I have just been informed.

187
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,270
This is terrible news, indeed.

188
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,140
Please let me know if there is anything I can do.

189
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,210
I will, thank you, sir.

190
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,400
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.

191
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,360
Spencer?

192
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,820
Pulling the ground plan of the terminal off the NTSB server

193
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,190
and sending it to Jack Bauer now.

194
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,570
Good. Edgar.

195
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,310
Were you able to identify the terrorists from the photos Jack sent?

196
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,890
Still no matches on the watch list.

197
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
I tried three different encoding arrays.

198
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,570
Did you try widening the parameters?

199
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,030
If it was any wider, we could use the phone book.

200
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,790
Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.

201
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,740
Try using np-safe adaptive search.

202
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,050
You okay?

203
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,500
Thanks for asking, Edgar.

204
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,070
Chloe...

205
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,410
you managed to rack up four protocol violations.

206
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,950
Well, it's a lot worse than that if you count agency dot codes.

207
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,480
It's more like 26 violations.

208
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,370
Do you want me to figure out whose face that is?

209
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,750
Or I could just go wait in holding.

210
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,450
See what you can do.

211
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,060
Did it work?

212
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,930
We got something.

213
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,220
It's off an archive from the Bureau of Consular Affairs.

214
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
Anton Beresch,

215
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,920
a former army officer in one of the Russian breakaway republics.

216
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,520
Which means this definitely has something to do with the Summit.

217
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
I'll data-mine the interagency servers,

218
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,920
see what I can come up with.

219
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,100
DOD is receiving a localized broadcast from the airport.

220
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,630
The networks are also picking it up.

221
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,890
Spenser, put it on screen.

222
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,530
...citizens of the United States,

223
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,040
today your President and the President of Russia

224
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,100
have come together to sign what they have called an historical accord,

225
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,190
an Antiterrorism Alliance.

226
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,150
Your leaders claim it will bring peace and security to their respective countries.

227
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,300
As you'll soon learn, it'll accomplish exactly the opposite.

228
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,400
We are acting on behalf of the oppressed people of our region.

229
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,250
A people whose desire to be free is every bit as strong as your own.

230
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,470
We are prepared to use every means at our disposal to achieve our goal.

231
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,830
I have hostages.

232
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,750
Unless President Logan and President Suvarov

233
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,790
make a joint statement repudiating this accord,

234
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,110
I will order their execution.

235
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,950
You have exactly 90 minutes.

236
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,370
We have to get this lunatic off the air.

237
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,910
Sir, we can contact the networks,

238
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,980
but they're under no legal obligation to comply.

239
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,630
We take these actions with the full knowledge that we will be called butchers,

240
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,050
but we are only responding to the violence that has been

241
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,680
inflicted upon our own sons and daughters.

242
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,810
Until we as a people achieve our own due

243
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,030
national sovereignty,

244
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,450
terror will be met with terror.

245
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,060
That was a live feed from the Ontario Airport in southern California.

246
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,600
As we just heard,

247
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,660
the terrorists are demanding

248
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,210
that President Logan repudiate the antiterrorism accord.

249
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,690
This is insane.

250
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,630
How did these people get control of an entire airport?

251
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,870
We've been preparing for this summit for 16 months!

252
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,580
Every news agency in the world is here!

253
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,820
I... I've staked my entire administration on this day

254
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,840
and now these people are demanding that I go on national television

255
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,180
and publicly repudiate everything we've done?

256
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,630
Mr. President, perhaps you should take a few moments...

257
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,970
Mike!

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,030
I want this handled!

259
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,810
Do you understand?

260
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,580
I don't care how you do it, I don't care what it takes.

261
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,160
Fix it!

262
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,100
All right.

263
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,750
Go ahead.

264
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,180
Curtis, this is Jack.

265
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,560
I'm staring straight down on the main concourse.

266
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,690
I've got six hostiles wearing explosive vests.

267
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,890
Four of them are staying near the hostages.

268
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,230
I expect their orders are to detonate if we try and make a move.

269
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,200
The other two are roaming.

270
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,740
I've got two security doors on the northeast side of the concourse,

271
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,560
both are chained, but currently unguarded.

272
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,410
All right, get a recon unit over to the northeast wall.

273
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,520
All right, Jack, I'm gonna need you to quarterback this thing from inside.

274
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,420
Copy that.

275
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,270
Hey, I got a woman, Diane Huxley,

276
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,800
says she has information for CTU.

277
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,510
Diane Huxley, who is she?

278
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,230
Curtis, did you just say Diane Huxley?

279
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,080
Yes, I did.

280
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,070
Is she there?

281
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,970
Yeah.

282
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,760
Let me speak to her.

283
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,010
I'll bring her over.

284
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,150
Hello?

285
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,790
Diane, what's going on? What's wrong?

286
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,130
Derek is inside the terminal.

287
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,740
What are you talking about? I left him with you.

288
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,320
He saw some men, he wanted to warn you.

289
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,600
I tried to go after him.

290
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,850
There was an explosion.

291
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,590
Are you sure he made it all the way inside?

292
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,530
I don't know.

293
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,220
Hold on.

294
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,130
Damn it!

295
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,380
I see him.

296
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,990
He's with the other hostages, but he's not hurt.

297
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,460
Please don't let anything happen to him.

298
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,560
Jack, I can't lose my son.

299
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,290
Diane, listen to me.

300
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,260
I promise you on my life, I am gonna get Derek back to you.

301
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,850
Do you understand me?

302
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,410
Okay.

303
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,050
Let me speak to Curtis.

304
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,220
Jack.

305
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,840
Hey, Curtis, I need to ask you a favor.

306
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,270
I want you to let me, Huxley stay with you at the command post.

307
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,400
You got it.

308
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,170
I need you to let me know if the hostiles adjust their profile in any way.

309
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,440
Copy that.

310
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,610
I'll get back to you.

311
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,510
Son of a bitch!

312
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,410
His name is Anton Beresch.

313
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,340
He's a member of the Dawn Brigade,

314
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,800
a separatist movement blamed for numerous terrorist bombings in Russia.

315
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,890
Precisely the kind of terrorist organization

316
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,950
today's accord was designed to combat.

317
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,940
Bill, I have no intention of calling off this signing,

318
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,010
much less making a public statement to that effect.

319
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,780
So that gives you less than 90 minutes to rescue the hostages.

320
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,640
We're already operating under that timetable, sir.

321
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,710
We have a unit on the ground

322
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,350
and we're making an on site assessment.

323
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,700
Spare the agency patter, just get it done.

324
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,330
Sir, you need to be aware,

325
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,580
we should be prepared to accept additional civilian casualties.

326
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,740
More casualties?

327
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,380
It's a possibility we have to face, sir.

328
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,330
I'm not prepared to accept any such thing.

329
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,980
Bill, it's your job to make sure those people get out of there alive.

330
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,710
Mr. President, the terrorists are wearing explosive vests.

331
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,080
They've threatened to detonate themselves

332
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,980
and the hostages if any attempt is made to retake the terminal.

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,170
I'm aware of the situation.

334
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,780
Bill, have you tried initiating a dialogue with the terrorists?

335
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,150
Yes, what about talking to them?

336
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,330
Have you tried that?

337
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,510
Beresch placed a call to an airport police sergeant.

338
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,820
It was a blocked number, but we're in the process of back tracing it.

339
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,510
Look, whatever you do, just make sure it's done by the deadline.

340
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,870
When I put my name on that accord,

341
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,120
I do not want to be signing the death warrant of innocent American citizens.

342
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,990
Yes, Mr. President.

343
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,580
Do you have that number?

344
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,480
Yes, sir, we just completed the backtrace.

345
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,760
Try it.

346
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,190
It's gonna be okay.

347
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,580
It's gonna be okay.

348
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,340
Yes?

349
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,160
This is Bill Buchanan,

350
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,060
a Director of the Los Angeles Counterterrorist Unit.

351
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,290
I am listening.

352
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,680
the President has authorized me to speak on his behalf.

353
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,160
I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully.

354
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,530
I've told you how to resolve this peacefully.

355
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,730
Your president must make a public statement.

356
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,440
I know he's considering that option.

357
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,950
Then we have nothing more to speak about.

358
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,520
There must be some other way we can address your demands.

359
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,520
I don't think you understand just how serious we are.

360
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,770
Wait, we can talk about...

361
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,750
Data-mine the call.

362
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,240
Yes, sir.

363
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,360
Get up!

364
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,630
Up!

365
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,660
What?

366
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,080
Bring him.

367
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,260
Curtis, they're moving one of the hostages.

368
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,360
On your knees!

369
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,500
Oh, my god.

370
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,240
Please...

371
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,290
I have a wife.

372
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,830
So do I.

373
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,860
No.

374
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,570
You!

375
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,010
No.

376
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,240
Curtis, they're moving another one of the hostages.

377
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,640
I can't see where, I'm changing position.

378
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,770
Derek?

379
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,970
Madam, please, madam.

380
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,270
That's my son.

381
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,560
They're gonna kill my son!

382
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,040
That's my son!

383
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,030
Derek!

384
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,490
No, let me go!

385
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,790
In 15 minutes,

386
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,450
your president will get another demonstration of our commitment.

387
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,360
15 minutes.

388
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,180
I'm in position.

389
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,810
How much longer till you're ready to move in?

390
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,880
At least a half hour.

391
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,420
We're still transferring personnel from the Summit.

392
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,760
Negative, that's too long, you need to advance your attack.

393
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,340
We can't, we're just not ready.

394
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,900
Curtis, they're gonna kill that kid.

395
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,270
Jack...

396
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,110
I heard that woman Diane's side of the conversation.

397
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,570
This has nothing to do with her.

398
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,870
These people are gonna continue to kill hostages

399
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,120
until the Summit deadline.

400
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,300
We can't risk the lives of all those hostages for this one kid.

401
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:54,940
You know that.

402
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,290
I not gonna jeopardize the mission.

403
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,530
Just tell your men to hurry.

404
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,090
They will.

405
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,290
It's all connected.

406
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,710
Maybe that's enough, Mrs. Logan.

407
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,480
The doctor said you really shouldn't be watching this...

408
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,010
Evelyn...

409
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,080
David Palmer called me last night.

410
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,580
He said he had something to tell me.

411
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,070
It was a matter of national security.

412
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,240
I think it has something to do with this.

413
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,080
The terrorists?

414
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,010
Yes, I tried to tell my husband and Walt Cummings,

415
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,460
but they think I imagined the call.

416
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,210
So we checked the phone recordings.

417
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,120
The conversations don't match.

418
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,830
Someone altered the conversation, Evelyn.

419
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,580
Who would do something like that?

420
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,580
I don't know.

421
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,330
Now listen to me.

422
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,290
You have got to cover for me.

423
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,630
No one can know that I am gone, do you understand me?

424
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,500
Where are you going?

425
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,160
O'brian.

426
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,320
Chloe, is that you?

427
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,100
Jack?

428
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,770
What's going on? Why are you answering the phone?

429
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,320
Mr. Buchanan needed my help with the airport crisis.

430
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,520
Are you alone?

431
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,070
Yeah.

432
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,460
Okay, I'm going to send a picture of one of the hostiles over to your screen, hold on.

433
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,590
Okay, I got it.

434
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,450
I want you to enlarge the upper right corner of his vest.

435
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,930
Looks like a secondary detonator, cell phone activated.

436
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,720
Yeah, so the leader can set off the charges individually in case anybody gets cold feet.

437
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,860
I need the detonation frequency.

438
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,170
Okay, I'll have to I.D. the detonator.

439
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,100
It could take some time.

440
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,840
Just get started.

441
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,600
Did you clear this with Buchanan?

442
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,220
No.

443
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,660
Chloe, can you see the live feed?

444
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,930
Oh, my god, it's derek.

445
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,690
I need your help.

446
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,170
Okay, I'll get back to you.

447
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,200
Spenser...

448
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,800
I was really worried about you.

449
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,850
Uh, not now.

450
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,460
I need you to reconfigure Jack's phone to emit an alternate signal.

451
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,720
What for?

452
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,450
Could you just work up a procedure?

453
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,610
This is off protocol, isn't it?

454
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,020
Yes.

455
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,290
Spenser, you have more knowledge about bandwidth processing than anyone here.

456
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,950
I need you.

457
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,480
Got it?

458
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,120
Yeah.

459
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,930
It's Agent Pierce.

460
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,290
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan to the garden room.

461
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,780
She's still not ready.

462
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,440
President Logan is expecting her 15 minutes before the ceremony.

463
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,470
Could I speak with her?

464
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,690
What's going on?

465
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,160
She's in one of her moods.

466
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,930
If you push her, it'll make it worse.

467
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,200
I'll wait out here.

468
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,800
Thanks.

469
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,890
It's Mr. Burk, isn't it?

470
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,340
Uh, Mrs. Logan.

471
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,900
You work in the communications office, don't you?

472
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,740
Yes, madam.

473
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,600
I know that all phone conversations are recorded.

474
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,000
Where do they keep those recordings?

475
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,230
Uh, well, the calls are recorded onto a hard drive.

476
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,250
It's part of the central server.

477
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,980
Is there, by any chance, any hard copies?

478
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,670
Actually, the... the President insists on written transcripts as backups.

479
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,220
He's... he's kind of old-fashioned that way.

480
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,620
I know. Where do they store those transcripts?

481
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,000
Archive room down the hall.

482
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,610
Can you show me?

483
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,170
Access is restricted.

484
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,330
I'm the First Lady.

485
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,570
I understand, Mrs. Logan.

486
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,230
Uh... but there are security requirements.

487
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,950
You... you have to have an entry card.

488
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,740
Do you have one?

489
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,040
Well, yes, I do.

490
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,560
Can I borrow it?

491
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,340
It's extremely important.

492
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,530
Mrs. Logan, I'm sorry.

493
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,850
Um... there's... there's nothing I can do.

494
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,620
Mr. Burk.

495
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,580
We can continue this little dance if you really want to,

496
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,870
but you and I both know I am going to get into that room.

497
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,060
So you can save us both the trouble and just give me your entry card.

498
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,330
Mrs. Logan, you wouldn't...

499
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,610
You know, in three seconds, Mr. Burk.

500
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,580
I am going to scream louder than any woman you've ever heard in your life.

501
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,460
One... two...

502
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,610
Here's the card, here.

503
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,510
Thank you.

504
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,470
Yeah.

505
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,910
Thank you.

506
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,540
I'll return it very soon.

507
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,840
O'brian.

508
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,820
Chloe, they're going to kill Derek in less than three minutes.

509
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,860
I need that frequency.

510
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,100
We're still trying to find the manufacturer of the detonator.

511
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,690
Hurry, we're running out of time.

512
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,100
I know, but if we don't get the frequency right,

513
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,170
we could accidentally detonate all the vests.

514
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,710
Okay, there's no match on any of the Czech military components.

515
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,430
That leaves the German manufacturers.

516
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,410
Jack, we're trying to narrow it down.

517
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,600
Now, the first team will enter through the southeast door

518
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,170
and split into two flanks.

519
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,100
The primary kill shots will take out the hostiles wearing bomb vests.

520
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,450
Second team enters through the southeast door.

521
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,650
Forms a protective ring around the hostages.

522
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,270
We'll only have a few seconds to neutralize the hostiles.

523
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,420
So find your targets fast.

524
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,190
Go.

525
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,610
What's your time frame?

526
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,710
We're on target to launch the assault in 15 minutes.

527
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,290
Understood.

528
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,920
How old are you?

529
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,270
Fifteen.

530
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,060
Try to control your breathing.

531
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,920
Slow down.

532
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,360
See?

533
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,050
Better.

534
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,120
Please don't kill me.

535
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,840
That's up to your president.

536
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,600
Bill Buchanan.

537
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,290
Beresch is calling from the airport, sir.

538
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,590
This is Bill Buchanan.

539
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,100
The boy hasn't long to live.

540
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,480
We're haven't heard from the President yet.

541
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,420
We need more time.

542
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,560
No.

543
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,870
The President must announce the Summit is canceled

544
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,660
or I kill the boy.

545
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,570
We're doing our best to get an answer from the President.

546
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,470
I implore you to resolve this without further killing.

547
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,590
This boy's blood will be on his hands.

548
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,760
Come on, Chloe.

549
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,540
Jack, we just got a match on the manufacturer.

550
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,670
We're trying to figure out the frequency.

551
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
There's no match on the 2004 series.

552
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,970
It's got to be one of these three.

553
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,610
Hold him!

554
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,360
Agent Manning!

555
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,870
I got it.

556
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,340
Here it is.

557
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,840
We've got the trigger frequency for the detonator.

558
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,400
Go to submenu three on your phone.

559
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,490
I'm at submenu.

560
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,340
Enter this code, 6 3 3 9.

561
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,470
Now what?

562
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,500
The phone needs to reboot.

563
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,410
When it does, it'll give you a ready message.

564
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,760
Then you press the star key

565
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,270
and it should send the signal to set off the detonator.

566
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,320
Your president has abandoned you.

567
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,350
I'm not getting a ready message signal.

568
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,130
It takes time to reflash the rom.

569
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,650
Son of a bitch, come on!

570
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,010
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,790
I got it, I got it!

572
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,080
Curtis, what was that?

573
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,370
There was an explosion in the terminal.

574
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,540
We can't tell what it is from here.

575
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,330
Patch me through to Jack.

576
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,040
Stay in position! Keep the hostages together!

577
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,470
Check the exits, make sure the perimeter's secure!

578
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,780
It was Ibrim's vest.

579
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,360
It must have detonated by accident.

580
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,660
Jack, what's going on?

581
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,030
One of the terrorists' vests blew up.

582
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,780
But none of the hostages were hurt.

583
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,410
Were you responsible for that, Jack?

584
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,450
Jack, answer me.

585
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,530
Bill, they were going to kill another hostage.

586
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,540
I didn't have a choice.

587
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,230
I didn't compromise my position.

588
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,820
Now you tell me this,

589
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,560
are Curtis and his team on schedule?

590
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,960
Yes, the backup units are in position.

591
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,220
Go time is ten minutes.

592
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay.

593
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,550
Everyone.

594
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:31,440
Fall into formation B and run circuit checks on your vests.

595
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,510
The terrorists are revising their formation.

596
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,100
I'll contact Curtis in the next few minutes with final positions.

597
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,530
Thanks, Jack.

598
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,390
Mr. Buchanan, President Logan's on the line for you.

599
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,390
Mr. President.

600
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,770
The news is saying there was some kind of explosion inside the terminal.

601
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,440
Everything is under control, sir.

602
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,220
Our tactical units are in position.

603
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,510
Go time is ten minutes.

604
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,880
Then what caused the explosion?

605
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,390
Well, we're not entirely certain, sir.

606
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,960
We believe that our man inside may have been trying to stall the execution of a hostage.

607
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,970
He triggered the bomb vest of a hostile.

608
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,640
Did you authorize this action?

609
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,370
No, sir, he acted independently.

610
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,190
You should know, Mr. President, the man we're talking about is Jack Bauer.

611
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,380
Jack Bauer?

612
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,010
He was in the terminal when the terrorists attacked.

613
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,770
He's been helping us coordinate our operation from inside, sir.

614
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,630
I thought that Jack Bauer assassinated David Palmer.

615
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,360
There's mitigating evidence to suggest that Bauer may have been framed, Mr. President.

616
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,980
What evidence? What are you talking about?

617
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,750
It's complicated, Mr. President.

618
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,490
Why am I only hearing about this now?

619
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,600
I didn't want to distract you with details that could wait

620
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,120
until after we'd resolved this hostage situation, sir.

621
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,920
You tell me everything and I will decide which details are relevant.

622
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,970
With respect, Mr. President, we don't have time.

623
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,320
Then talk faster.

624
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,810
Mrs. Logan is due in the garden room right now.

625
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,130
Open the door, please.

626
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,480
Just a few more minutes!

627
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,960
Madam, it's my job to make sure she's there.

628
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,380
If you don't open the door,

629
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,130
I will open it myself.

630
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,670
Mrs. Logan.

631
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,950
How dare you barge in here.

632
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,840
Mrs. Logan.

633
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,640
This is a private residence.

634
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,030
Eelyn, if something happens to Mrs. Logan,

635
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,560
the blame will fall on you.

636
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,830
We both know that.

637
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:51,670
So I am urging you in the strongest possible terms to tell me where she is.

638
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,490
We're moving to entry positions.

639
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,000
Davies, Matthews, are your teams in place?

640
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,510
All teams in place and ready to go, Agent Manning.

641
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,070
All right, copy.

642
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,100
Go.

643
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,130
Oh, my god.

644
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,370
It's okay, listen, listen.

645
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,370
Derek's alive, he's okay.

646
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,320
Are you sure?

647
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,150
I can't go into details, but he's okay.

648
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,880
I have to go, we're mounting our rescue operation.

649
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,040
Thank you.

650
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,030
Keep an eye on her.

651
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,320
Let's go.

652
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,510
They're waiting for you in the garden room, Mrs. Logan.

653
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,780
I can get up myself.

654
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,000
All right.

655
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,170
But you still need to come with me.

656
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,400
Whatever you say, Aaron.

657
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,620
Whatever you say.

658
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,180
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Logan.  - It's all right.

659
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,670
I'm really sorry.

660
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,940
Evelyn, will you stop apologizing? It's annoying.

661
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,800
Besides, I got what I came for.

662
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,610
Yes.

663
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,230
You have a problem at the terminal.

664
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,330
Explain.

665
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,380
Jack Bauer is inside providing recon for CTU's rescue operation,

666
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,890
which will launch shortly.

667
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,860
Are you sure?

668
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,100
This came straight from the Director of CTU.

669
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,190
And Bauer was responsible for detonating the vest of one of Beresch's men.

670
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,140
Can you tell me Bauer's precise location?

671
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,390
No.

672
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,360
But I know he has a connection to one of the hostages,

673
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,480
a 15 year old boy named Derek Huxley.

674
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,790
I have to go.

675
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,470
Tell them that's being handled out of the press office.

676
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,880
Thank you.

677
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,700
Yes?

678
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,420
Mrs. Logan is back in her room, getting ready.

679
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,950
Why the delay?

680
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,000
She was in one of the archive rooms.

681
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,270
Archive rooms...

682
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,670
what was she doing there?

683
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,770
The First Lady is safe and accounted for.

684
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,470
You'll need to ask her about anything beyond that.

685
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,440
Thank you, Aaron.

686
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,190
C. T.

687
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,030
Go to the ticket counters.

688
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,700
Go to the west exit.

689
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,670
Manning.

690
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,020
Curtis, this is Jack.

691
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,340
Beresch's redeployed six men.

692
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,460
Are you ready for final positions?

693
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,730
Go ahead.

694
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,100
Four men were deployed to the east side of the terminal in front of the ticket counter.

695
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,340
The other two to the west side of the terminal in front of the emergency exits.

696
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:34,950
Do you copy?

697
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,920
Copy.

698
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,560
Okay, once you deploy,

699
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,980
I'll give you real time updates on their positions.

700
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,480
All right, Jack, I'm starting the countdown.

701
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,780
All teams stand by to execute.

702
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,240
This is it.

703
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,070
He's in the terminal now.

704
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,370
Okay.

705
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,070
Hostages up!

706
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,080
Hold on one second.

707
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,730
Hold on.

708
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,960
Hold on, Beresch is changing something.

709
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,540
He's moving...

710
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,820
Jack? Jack!

711
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,050
Curtis, what happened?

712
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,090
I lost Jack.

713
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,250
What do you mean, you lost him?

714
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,120
The connection's broken.

715
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,610
Can you reconnect?

716
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,190
I'm trying.

717
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,470
Jack Bauer.

718
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,470
Derek is a very brave young man.

719
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,490
I will shoot him in the head if you don't show yourself immediately.

720
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,040
- Curtis!  - It's not going through, Bill.

721
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,150
Can you move in without him?

722
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,140
The last thing Jack said was that Beresch was moving something.

723
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,430
He could be moving the hostages into the kill zone.

724
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,620
Abort.

725
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,780
All teams, abort the operation.

726
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,470
Repeat, this is an abort.

727
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,900
Bauer, if you want to save the boy,

728
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,740
present yourself now.

729
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Mr. Bauer!

730
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:39,000
Derek has five seconds left to live.

731
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,490
Four.

732
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,420
- Three...  - Beresch!

733
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,550
I'm lowering my weapon.

734
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,670
Secure him.

735
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


736
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,500
The terrorists are controlling the main terminal at Ontario Airport.

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,920
Today, your President and the President of Russia

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,080
have come together to sign an Antiterrorism Alliance.

4
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,710
I have hostages.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,550
Unless President Logan and President Suvarov

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,550
make a joint statement repudiating this accord,

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,540
I will order their execution.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,300
I want this handled!

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,270
Do you understand?

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,880
I don't care how you do it, I don't care what it takes.

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,070
Fix it!

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,150
David Palmer called me last night.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,260
He said it was a matter of national security.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,940
Those were his exact words.

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,220
I need to talk to you.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,360
It's hardly a matter of national security.

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,210
- That's not what he said.  - Yes, it is.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,050
No, that is a trick.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,230
I know that all phone conversations are recorded.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,620
Where do they store those transcripts?

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,320
Archive room, down the hall.

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,440
This is Bill Buchanan.

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,580
I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully.

24
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,480
I don't think you understand just how serious we are.

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,410
You make any efforts to enter the tunnel,

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,650
you will spend the rest of the day collecting body parts.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,730
Jack, I'm going to need you to quarterback this thing from inside.

28
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,210
I'm staring straight down on the main concourse.

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,620
We've got six hostiles wearing explosive vests.

30
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,110
We have to assume their orders are to detonate 

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,360
if we try to make a move.

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,070
Hey, I got a woman, Diane Huxley, 

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,720
says she has information for CTU.

34
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,180
Diane, what's going on? What's wrong?

35
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,110
Derek is inside the terminal.

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,370
You!

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,050
No.

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,260
Curtis, they're moving another one of the hostages.

39
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,250
Oh, my god, it's Derek.

40
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,720
You have a problem at the terminal.

41
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,140
Jack Bauer is inside providing recon for CTU's rescue operation.

42
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,600
Mr. Bauer!

43
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,560
Derek has five seconds left to live.

44
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,760
Four...

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,020
Beresch!

46
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,170
We've been trying from here, 

47
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,420
but we still can't make contact with Jack.

48
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,640
Can you make a visual, Curtis?

49
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,400
Negative.

50
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,440
Maybe Jack went dark intentionally.

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,560
Unlikely.

52
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,620
He was talking to us when his transmission cut off.

53
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,690
We have to assume he's been captured or killed.

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,080
Which means we need to mount this assault without his help.

55
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,600
Without Jack directing our teams,

56
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,470
success probability falls to less than 20 percent.

57
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,790
President Logan is going to sign this treaty in less than an hour.

58
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,280
If the terrorists are still in control, 

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,750
they'll kill all the hostages.

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,760
What do you want me to do, Bill?

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,290
Work up an assault plan that doesn't include Jack.

62
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,890
All right, I'm going back to the staging area, 

63
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,510
we'll coordinate from there.

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,450
Back to your stations, prepare to reconfigure.

65
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,960
All teams, stand down.

66
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,490
We're working up a new mission profile.

67
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,830
Mr. Bauer.

68
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,610
What is CTU's assault plan?

69
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,860
The boy means something to you,

70
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,870
otherwise, you wouldn't have given yourself up so easily.

71
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,840
Tell me the plan.

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,130
They're going to storm the north concourse doors on my command.

73
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,720
I'm coordinating the operation from in here.

74
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,980
Is there anyone else inside?

75
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,040
No.

76
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,360
Get me the plans to the terminal.

77
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,970
You've been a great help.

78
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,390
We'll keep the boy.

79
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,230
Bring me another hostage.

80
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,670
Anything you do in here today

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,970
will not stop that treaty from being signed.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,670
The United States government does not negotiate with terrorists.

83
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,820
You know that.

84
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,340
Your president is a weak man.

85
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,500
He'll back down once more blood is spilled.

86
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,010
Not him.

87
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,480
Move! Move!

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,180
Please...

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,390
please, you don't have to do this.

90
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,610
Vlad.

91
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,880
I can help you buy more time.

92
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,230
Please!

93
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,620
No!

94
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,920
You don't have to do this now.

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,570
CTU was supposed to have raided the terminal by now.

96
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,230
Why haven't we heard from them?

97
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,210
Bill Buchanan said they had a setback.

98
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,370
What kind of setback?

99
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,260
They lost contact with Jack Bauer.

100
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,000
Why? What happened to him?

101
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,220
They're not sure what happened to him,

102
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,330
but they need to reconfigure their assault plan.

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,310
Yeah.

104
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll tell the President.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,290
Beresch is transmitting from the terminal.

106
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,510
He's got another hostage.

107
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,380
We have waited patiently for you 

108
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,540
to renounce this unholy pact with our oppressors,

109
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,010
but we have heard nothing.

110
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,430
This is the cost of that silence.

111
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,270
What happens next is your choice, Mr. President.

112
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,300
If you choose to sign this corrupt document,

113
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,550
understand that you will also be staining it with the blood of the remaining hostages.

114
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,400
If CTU can't pull this off in time,

115
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,090
that's upwards of 60 people, Mike.

116
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,240
You know I've never done anything

117
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,090
in my presidency that I didn't feel was right for the country.

118
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,880
Of course not, sir.

119
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,970
Nobody thinks otherwise.

120
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,800
I know I'm ambitious

121
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,490
that I want this treaty to be the hallmark of my presidency,

122
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,350
but I never thought I would sacrifice innocent life.

123
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,730
Mr. President.

124
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,550
You are not responsible for the actions of these murderers.

125
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,780
I could postpone this.

126
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,530
Sir?

127
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,070
I give them what they want, maybe nobody else has to die.

128
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,230
Do you think these people would actually release the hostages?

129
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,950
We both know that would never happen.

130
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,810
You're doing the only thing you can do.

131
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,360
The terrorists, calling the treaty an Unholy Pact...

132
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,300
Mrs. Logan, if someone altered the recording

133
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
of your conversation with David Palmer,

134
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,690
the President needs to know.

135
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,080
No, not now, not yet.

136
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,260
What are you waiting for?

137
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,160
Charles is much too preoccupied

138
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,250
between the Summit and the hostage situation.

139
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,530
He's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.

140
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,820
Besides, he thinks I'm unstable.

141
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,460
Which means I have to show it to him in just the right way.

142
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,780
So until the treaty is signed,

143
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,290
I'm not letting this out of my sight.

144
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,650
What's happening?

145
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,860
I'm sorry, I don't have time to explain.

146
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,250
You said you were going in to get the hostages.

147
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,480
We lost contact with Jack.

148
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,480
What does that mean?

149
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,420
We're not sure what happened, 

150
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,280
but we need to change our assault plan.

151
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,970
- Is Jack okay?  - We don't know.

152
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,890
What about Derek?

153
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,960
As soon as we get more information, I'll make sure you're told.

154
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,810
- Please, I...  - Mrs. Huxley...

155
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,500
I need to go.

156
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,960
The situation here continues to grow more tragic.

157
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,350
We've just received a video feed confirming

158
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,180
that another hostage has been executed inside the main terminal at Ontario Airport.

159
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,860
- Jack...  - Don't say anything.

160
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,200
We're going to get through this, 

161
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,990
just don't say anything right now.

162
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,420
... White House spokesperson

163
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,600
confirms and reiterates the President's intention

164
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,020
to sign the historic pact with his Russian counterpart as scheduled.

165
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,340
You're going to call CTU and 

166
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,180
tell them you've revised your assault profile.

167
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,690
Tell them to come

168
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,400
to the emergency door,

169
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,850
south of gate 12.

170
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
They won't just do that because I ask them to.

171
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,020
They'll need an explanation.

172
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,190
That's your concern, Mr. Bauer.

173
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,130
Overwrite volume four with the approach vectors and rekey with the airport grid.

174
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,400
Okay, hold on, just for one second.

175
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,120
We don't have one second, we're running out of time to save the hostages.

176
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,400
Want some help, Spenser?

177
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,650
He doesn't need any help.

178
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,180
Just keep managing the two ways or else we're gonna have dropout.

179
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,370
Excuse me.

180
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,140
You're Miss. O'Brian, right?

181
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,410
Who are you?

182
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,170
Lynn McGill, I'm from district.

183
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,590
I met you when you came out for that memory management lecture.

184
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,050
If you say so, what do you need?

185
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,250
I need to talk to Bill Buchanan. Is he around?

186
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,140
He's in the situation room, he's kind of busy right now.

187
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,030
I see him, thanks.

188
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,230
I look forward to working with you today.

189
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,180
You don't know who Lynn McGill is, do you?

190
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,500
No, and I don't care, get back to work.

191
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,700
Once Curtis and his teams go in there, 

192
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,600
I want an update on deployment of HRT.

193
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,850
Mr. Buchanan, I assume they told you I was coming.

194
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,520
Lynn, please... call me Bill.

195
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,940
If we were having a beer or something, but at work,

196
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,500
it's better if we maintain a more formal mode of address.

197
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,340
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

198
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,210
Look, we're in the middle of final prep here.

199
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,010
I know.

200
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,670
I understand President Logan wants us to go into the terminal as soon as possible.

201
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,740
Yes, before the treaty is signed.

202
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Is Curtis manning ready to send his teams in?

203
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,170
He is, but we're flying blind.

204
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,000
My briefing sheet says that we have Jack Bauer on the inside.

205
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,510
And we haven't heard from him for close to 20 minutes now.

206
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,520
Well, that's interesting.

207
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,030
Lynn, I read the bulletin from division, but I still don't know why you're here.

208
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,400
District was getting heat from the White House.

209
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,700
Heat about what?

210
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,200
Jack Bauer.

211
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,860
They just want to know things are running smoothly.

212
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,030
We're on track, Lynn.

213
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,310
Well, I'm sure you are,

214
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,220
but that's my assignment.

215
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,150
Is your tactical wired through to all the servers?

216
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,630
Yes, it is, you can go ahead and plug into station four.

217
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,780
I'd prefer to work from your office, Mr. Buchanan.

218
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,700
I hate to displace you,

219
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,850
but I think I should have a central vantage point

220
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,440
and I just want to make sure that you're okay working from another station.

221
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,580
Fine.

222
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,450
Good.

223
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,230
And, uh...

224
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,220
it's not a big deal, but...

225
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,040
just so that everyone's clear on the chain of command.

226
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,270
I think you should address me as Mr. McGill in front of the others.

227
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,070
You know, Lynn, I'd rather not.

228
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,490
Just a suggestion.

229
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,470
Anyway, I need your office and that's not a suggestion.

230
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,130
Fine.

231
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,990
Mr. Buchanan, it's Jack Bauer on line one.

232
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,470
Is Curtis plugged into this call?

233
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,460
I'm on, Bill.

234
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,020
Go ahead, put Jack through.

235
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,760
You're both on with Jack Bauer.

236
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,100
Jack, what happened?

237
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,140
One of the hostiles got too close.

238
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,340
I had to end the transmission.

239
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,880
All right, we'll restart the countdown.

240
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,300
Negative, Curtis.

241
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,350
We need to scrap the existing plan.

242
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,860
Find a new breach point.

243
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,640
My men are already in position.

244
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,180
They moved the hostages within the kill zone.

245
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,020
They'll be taken out with the crossfire.

246
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,310
There's an emergency door just south of gate 12.

247
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,700
It's unguarded.

248
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,120
You should be able to punch through with no opposition.

249
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,260
I see it, but I'm not comfortable with this entry point.

250
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,300
It's the only shot we've got.

251
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,240
Are you there now?

252
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,590
Yes, it's clear.

253
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm in a flank two position.

254
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,150
I repeat, I am in flank two position.

255
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,340
Curtis, how long before your teams can redeploy?

256
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,110
About 20 minutes.

257
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,800
The President's going to sign that treaty

258
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,170
within 30 minutes.

259
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,430
I'll go as fast as I can.

260
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,350
Jack, I'll call you when my men are in position. 

261
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,370
You can call us in.

262
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,850
Copy that, I'll be standing by.

263
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,800
Ivan and Ishmael.

264
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,610
Stay with the hostages.

265
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,090
The rest of you come here.

266
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,850
Vlad, guard them.

267
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,850
You're doing great.

268
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,920
Manning.

269
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,700
It's Buchanan.

270
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,850
How long until your people are ready to move on the terrorists?

271
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,110
About 15 minutes.

272
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,280
Why so long?

273
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,910
When Jack called and changed the breach point,

274
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,190
I had to modify everything, including the explosives.

275
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,950
They have to be repositioned precisely.

276
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,830
Maybe it's a mistake to write down Jack's new information. 

277
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,970
It might take too long.

278
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,650
Jack's aware of our deadline.

279
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,000
If he didn't think it was worth the delay, 

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,240
he wouldn't have made the call.

281
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,730
I trust him.

282
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,800
All right, Curtis, 15 minutes.

283
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,740
You have to make this happen.

284
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,700
I will.

285
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,370
Call when you're in position.

286
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,350
Mr. Buchanan?

287
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,800
Mr. McGill needs to see you in his office.

288
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,550
It'll have to wait, tell him I'm busy.

289
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,360
He said it had to be now.

290
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,580
Fine.

291
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,570
No, I'm settled in fine.

292
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,570
If I need anything, I'll call, thanks, Donna.

293
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,750
What is it, Lynn? I'm up to my ears 

294
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,800
trying to coordinate this hostage situation.

295
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,790
Sit down, Mr. Buchanan.

296
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,890
Would you stop with the Mr. Buchanan?

297
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,230
We need to get this assault in motion now.

298
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,630
Sit down, Bill.

299
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,760
I informed the White House that 

300
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,510
the rescue operation is back on track.

301
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,000
Thank you.

302
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,330
I must admit, though, I felt a little inappropriate

303
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,900
talking about an operation that I didn't personally review.

304
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,560
So before you send your men into the terminal,

305
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,540
I'd like to see the playbook.

306
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,890
Look, I can't have you micro-managing my work here, Lynn.

307
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,320
If you want to do my job, just let me know, I'll go home.

308
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,320
Please don't be defensive.

309
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,080
I'm not challenging you, I'm just trying to do my job.

310
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,420
I'll have Chloe send it to your laptop, anything else?

311
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,940
That's all for now.

312
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,540
Bill?

313
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,240
Fighting me isn't going to increase 

314
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,500
our chances of saving those people's lives.

315
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,880
Lynn wants to look at the revised assault plan. Send it to him.

316
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,640
Does that mean he's running point, instead of you?

317
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,690
It just means he wants to see the plan, Chloe.

318
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,510
Bill.

319
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,690
Curtis just confirmed that his team will 

320
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,230
be ready in ten minutes based on Jack's new intel.

321
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,130
As of this time, there is no word as to whether or not the President

322
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,910
is going to call off the signing of the historic treaty agreement

323
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,820
between the United States and Russia scheduled for just under an hour.

324
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,240
There been any response from the White House since we killed the last hostage?

325
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,350
They released their statement confirming 

326
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,010
the signing of the treaty is going ahead as planned.

327
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,650
They won't capitulate as long as they think their rescue attempt will succeed.

328
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,040
Once we kill them,

329
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,680
then they'll realize their options have run out.

330
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,880
The only chance these people had of being rescued is gone because of me.

331
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,840
People were going to die here today, Derek.

332
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,320
That was their plan.

333
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,930
This is not your fault.

334
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,780
I'm the reason you went along with them.

335
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,240
If I wasn't here...

336
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,200
Stop it.

337
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,850
This is not over.

338
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,250
While there has been no official rebuke of the terrorists' demands,

339
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,380
statements from the White House appear to confirm the President's position is unchanged

340
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,600
and that the treaty will be signed within the hour as scheduled.

341
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,080
That puts the lives of the approximately 60 men,

342
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,360
women and children being held as hostage in question.

343
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,310
Were the terrorists to carry out their intentions...

344
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,550
Good news, sir.

345
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,470
CTU has reestablished contact with Jack Bauer.

346
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,940
The rescue operation is back on track.

347
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,330
But that's still no guarantee.

348
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,250
Excuse me, sir?

349
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,850
The hostages may be killed when we go in there.

350
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
Let's be honest.

351
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,660
That's more likely than not.

352
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,030
We don't know that, sir.

353
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,620
President Suvarov is waiting for you outside.

354
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,640
You're walking outside together onto the stage. We all agreed to the protocol.

355
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,450
- It's time already?  - Yes, sir.

356
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,430
Mr. President.

357
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,960
Shall we?

358
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,440
My people have just informed me that the assault has been delayed.

359
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,460
It's happening now.

360
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,680
It will happen

361
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,850
before the treaty is signed. Don't worry.

362
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,290
Mr. President, like you,

363
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,640
I have staked much of my political future on the success of this treaty.

364
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,160
If this rescue attempt fails,

365
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,360
it will not only be rendered meaningless,

366
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,680
it will become a mockery

367
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,540
and so will we.

368
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,070
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan.

369
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,570
The ceremony's beginning any minute.

370
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,540
She'll be out in a moment.

371
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,170
Oh, may I...

372
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,680
have a word?

373
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,540
You're aware Mrs. Logan was found in one of the archive rooms?

374
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,660
I don't know anything about that.

375
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,040
Aaron Pierce said you lied to him.

376
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,410
You told him Mrs. Logan was in her room

377
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,340
when she was actually going through classified documents.

378
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't think you understand just how

379
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,260
grave this situation is.

380
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,400
What do you mean?

381
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,280
Mrs. Logan removed a document from the archive

382
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,510
that contains highly sensitive intelligence protocols.

383
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,320
That's not what she said it was.

384
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,930
What exactly did she say she took?

385
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,810
I think that you should talk to her about this.

386
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,440
Evelyn, this is important.

387
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,100
What did she tell you?

388
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,330
She said it was a transcript of a call she had with David Palmer.

389
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,070
And I'm sure when she said that, she believed it.

390
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,390
You're aware if this document finds its way into the wrong hands,

391
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,740
that you'll be held responsible.

392
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm not the one who took it.

393
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,600
No, you aided and abetted.

394
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,240
You'll not only lose your job,

395
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,370
you'll be prosecuted.

396
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,010
That's not fair.

397
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,390
I tried to talk her out of this.

398
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,310
Look, all I'm asking is that you tell me where did she put it. 

399
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,880
She has it with her, it's in her blouse.

400
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,710
She said she wouldn't let it out of her sight until she talked to the President about it.

401
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,590
Walt?

402
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,660
Sorry to keep you waiting, I'm ready now.

403
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,260
President Logan and Suvarov will each make statements

404
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,010
which will be followed by the signing of the treaty.

405
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,120
There will be several photo opportunities...

406
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,670
How much time will there be

407
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,050
between the moment I step out on stage and when I sign the document?

408
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,640
Not long.

409
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,620
Does CTU know that's how long they have to launch the rescue attempt?

410
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,650
Yes, sir, they're completely synchronized with what's going on here.

411
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,370
I hope so.

412
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,760
The lives of those hostages depend on it.

413
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,610
Today was supposed to be the crowning achievement of my presidency.

414
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,290
Instead, everybody's waiting to hear

415
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,350
what's going to happen at the airport.

416
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,820
So, how are you feeling?

417
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,880
I'm fine.

418
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,500
Don't worry about me.

419
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,400
How come you just keep getting better looking as you get older

420
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,920
and I just keep getting older?

421
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,900
What are you talking about?

422
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,740
You're the most beautiful First Lady

423
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,250
pennsylvania avenue has ever seen.

424
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,410
Ladies and Gentlemen.

425
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,970
President Logan

426
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,900
and President Suvarov.

427
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,170
The treaty signing is a minute and a half ahead of schedule.

428
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,690
Should you call Curtis and let him know? He might need to speed up the assault prep.

429
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,790
No, Curtis is moving as fast as he can.

430
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,390
A call from me isn't gonna make him move any faster.

431
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,310
I just thought he might like to...

432
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,840
I said no, Chloe.

433
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,850
The only way to make sure the assault happens in time

434
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,010
to save the hostages is to try to slow down the signing.

435
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,850
What's wrong with Buchanan?

436
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,690
Nothing.

437
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,620
I think he just realizes we're not gonna be able to save the hostages.

438
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
Before we begin the treaty signing,

439
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,060
I would like to address what's happening just a few miles away from here.

440
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,360
As you know, terrorists have already taken innocent life

441
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:23,040
in an attempt to stop this historic treaty from being signed.

442
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,040
President Suvarov will not let this happen.

443
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,680
I will not let this happen!

444
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,360
Yes, Mike?

445
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,600
Bill, I should have heard from you by now. Have your men gone in yet?

446
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,130
We're not quite ready.

447
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,200
You have to go in now.

448
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,150
The President's about to sign that treaty.

449
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,130
I understand, we're pushing as hard as we can.

450
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,610
In the meantime, is there anything you can do on your end?

451
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,730
Like what?

452
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,460
Can you stall things? Can you slow down the ceremony?

453
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,850
Bill, the entire world is watching this on live television.

454
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,110
The Presidents of the United States and Russia are on stage now.

455
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,900
This process has been set in motion, no, I can't stall.

456
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,710
Okay, I'll call you back.

457
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,710
No, you stay on the phone with me.

458
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,080
I need to know the moment your people go in.

459
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,800
Yes, sir.

460
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,440
This barbaric lawlessness that's taking place at Ontario Airport,

461
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,840
only underscores the need...

462
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,010
the necessity for this accord

463
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,450
and for our continued vigilance

464
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,560
and commitment

465
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,110
to fighting terrorism around the world.

466
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,520
It looks like President Logan is going through with the signing.

467
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,790
He said he's not going to give in to your demands.

468
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,450
Are you sure this is going to work?

469
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,050
It will work.

470
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,560
And the reason the President is so confident

471
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,200
is that he thinks his rescue attempt will save the day.

472
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,920
Are you sure you can fend off that assault?

473
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,900
As soon as the CTU agents

474
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,820
come through the entry point that Jack Bauer fed to them they'll all be killed.

475
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,960
One of the President's aides will then walk up to the podium

476
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,370
and whisper into his ear that there'll be no rescue.

477
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,020
That his signature on the treaty

478
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,360
will be the death warrant of the hostages.

479
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,680
That will stop him, I assure you.

480
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,080
Well, just in case you're wrong and he signs the treaty.

481
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,820
You be ready to carry out your threat.

482
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,010
Every one of my men is committed to doing what needs to be done today.

483
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,890
We've upgraded our estimate of how many wounded there'll be.

484
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,250
I need ten more ambulances at the airport before we launch.

485
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,620
Right.

486
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,580
The rescue operation you're about to execute 

487
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,890
is radically changed from your initial approach.

488
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,410
It was revised based on new intelligence from Jack Bauer.

489
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,850
Which he phoned in after going dark for nearly 20 minutes, I was there.

490
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,580
- Right.  - I need to call you back.

491
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,240
Well, I can't say that his explanation for being out of touch is entirely satisfactory.

492
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,540
Jack said he was trying to avoid detection. What are you suggesting?

493
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,380
There's too many unusual circumstances at work here.

494
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,780
I want to try to understand it better before we send our people in.

495
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,500
I'll need the entire transcripts of your communications 

496
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,860
with Mr. Bauer since he's been inside.

497
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,710
To what end?

498
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,840
Thoroughness.

499
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,300
I don't need a sorting run on the calls, just the raw transcripts'll be fine.

500
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,530
- Fine, I'll send them to you.  - Thank you.

501
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,380
Curtis is on line three.

502
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,270
Curtis, what's your situation?

503
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,610
My men are in place and we're setting the entry charges.

504
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,750
Any complications?

505
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,900
No.

506
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,500
We're also jamming the trigger frequency, 

507
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,190
so Beresch can't detonate the vests remotely.

508
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,930
We should be able to make our entry on target.

509
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,060
Good.

510
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,950
Stay on the line until we give the go.

511
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,850
All right, Bill, copy.

512
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,390
O'Brian.

513
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,380
Uh, Miss O'Brian.

514
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,310
I'm trying to understand the transcript of Jack's last call to CTU

515
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,040
- and there are a few...  - Mr. McGill.

516
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,510
I'm really busy trying to help keep this revised assault on schedule.

517
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,730
What do you need?

518
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,230
I understand and I don't want to slow you down,

519
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,190
but I'd appreciate it if you'd unlock volume five.

520
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,390
There are a few things that I'd like to see.

521
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,810
I don't need to know what you'd like to see.

522
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,930
Okay, it's unlocked.

523
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,510
Good.

524
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,120
This Lynn McGill person's really slowing things down.

525
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,920
Yeah, that's his style.

526
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,310
I worked with him once before.

527
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,520
He usually loses about

528
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,250
20 percent of his staff in the first couple of days 

529
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,160
after taking control of a new office.

530
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,560
That many people quit?

531
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,410
No.

532
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,060
Most of them are fired.

533
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,250
In the volatile climate of the 21st century,

534
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,750
the sharing of deterrent technologies by responsible powers

535
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,450
is the surest guarantee of global peace.

536
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,650
But let this accord be proof

537
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,560
that our two great nations

538
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,350
stand together

539
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,750
in their commitment

540
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,840
to fight the enemies

541
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,190
of peace and freedom.

542
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,590
Akhmed found Chevensky.

543
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,540
He's dead, he killed himself.

544
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,210
We found him in the baggage room.

545
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,460
What about the key card?

546
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,960
Chevensky had it hidden right where he said he would.

547
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,070
Round up your men.

548
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,120
The rest of you will work clean up on whoever makes it through that line of fire.

549
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,780
Assume CTU is in body armor, so go for the head shot.

550
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,610
You... and you.

551
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,210
Guard the hostages.

552
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,640
Kill anyone who tries to break away.

553
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,900
Head down!

554
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,780
Black night is broken

555
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,200
by the dawning of the light of global peace.

556
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,620
Curtis.

557
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,410
Jack, my men are in place.

558
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,310
Okay.

559
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,260
Now, remember, I am in a flank two position.

560
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,190
Make sure your men don't hit me when they come in.

561
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,360
Roger that, ready to start the countdown on your word.

562
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,380
Jack?

563
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,700
Move in at your discretion.

564
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,750
All teams, we have a green light.

565
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,150
Counting down from 60 seconds on my mark.

566
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,390
Now, Jack, we'll see you inside.

567
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,650
Everyone, 60 seconds.

568
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,910
Stop the assault!

569
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,000
Put Curtis on the phone.

570
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,820
What are you talking about?

571
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,720
They're walking into a trap. Look at the transcript.

572
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,530
When Jack issued the command directive,

573
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,780
he used the term "flank two".

574
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,110
Yes, he was trying to give us his position inside the terminal.

575
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,780
No, he wasn't.

576
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,830
"Flank two" is a duress code used to indicate the agent is communicating under duress.

577
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,730
We ran Jack's calls through a protocol filter.

578
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,410
If there'd been a duress signal in there, it would've found it.

579
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,980
You filtered through the current codes.

580
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,680
When Jack was active, "flank two" was a duress code.

581
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,580
Chloe, confirm that.

582
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,540
Jack is trying to tell us he's being used to send misinformation.

583
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,330
If Curtis Manning's teams go in now, they'll be ambushed.

584
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,310
He's right.

585
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,620
Curtis, abort the countdown.

586
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,800
Repeat, abort, abort.

587
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,090
Stand down, all teams stand down.

588
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,160
We're aborting entry, repeat, we're aborting entry.

589
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,390
Confirm that we're standing down. What's wrong, Bill?

590
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,880
We detected a duress code in Jack's call.

591
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,540
We have to assume that terrorists are feeding him the information he gave us.

592
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,440
Redeploy your men according to the original assault plan

593
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,020
and do not contact Jack. If Jack contacts you, buy time.

594
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,560
Copy that, we're moving.

595
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,100
You're gonna outflank the terrorists?

596
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,110
Yes.

597
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,280
That should work.

598
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,570
All teams.

599
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,670
Reposition for entry through the east and north gates, plan Bravo, repeat,

600
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,600
plan Bravo through the east and north gates. Go!

601
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,070
Acknowledged. Redeploy protocol one.

602
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,670
What's happening?

603
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,330
Madam, I need you to step back to the vehicle. Now.

604
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,860
He said 60 seconds three minutes ago. What is CTU waiting for?

605
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,270
I don't know.

606
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,950
You heard what I heard.

607
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,840
It's Jack.

608
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,220
Jack.

609
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,310
What's happening?

610
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,400
There was a malfunction on the entry charges.

611
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,900
What's the time frame?

612
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,950
Any minute.

613
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,770
They're resetting the detonators. Stand by.

614
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,500
Copy that.

615
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,280
They're in position.

616
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,570
Stay ready!

617
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,220
Yeah.

618
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,490
Is it done?

619
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,710
No, CTU hasn't attacked yet.

620
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,930
You said it would happen before the signing.

621
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,710
And you told me the President would never let it go this far.

622
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,260
He's signing it.

623
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,390
You have no choice.

624
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,950
Kill them all.

625
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,880
No!

626
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,720
Are you okay?

627
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,090
Yeah.

628
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,320
Secure the terminal.

629
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,120
Besides the hostiles, there appears to be no further casualties.

630
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,660
Repeat, remaining hostages are unharmed.

631
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,470
Good work, Curtis.

632
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,270
You get that, Mike?

633
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,720
Got it, thanks, Bill, good work.

634
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,690
Mr. President.

635
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,500
I have some good news.

636
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,360
I have just received word

637
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,630
that the crisis at the Ontario Airport is over.

638
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,790
The rescue operation that I authorized was successful.

639
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,490
The terrorists have been captured or killed.

640
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,480
And, best of all,

641
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,460
this has all been accomplished

642
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,330
with no further loss of innocent life.

643
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,450
Excuse me, agent!

644
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,770
My name is Jack Bauer.

645
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,860
I know who you are, sir.

646
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,360
Can I use your pick?

647
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,970
This is Derek Huxley.

648
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,220
His mother is waiting for him at the command post.

649
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,280
- Can you please take him there?  - Of course.

650
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,510
What about you?

651
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,400
Come here.

652
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,690
I have to finish this.

653
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,790
Go take care of your mother.

654
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,170
- Yeah.  - Okay.

655
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,010
Go.

656
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,880
I'm missing one.

657
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,760
Everybody, I need your attention.

658
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,650
We're looking for a man who was being held here with you.

659
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,470
He's a white male, mid-30s.

660
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,660
He was wearing a bright yellow tie.

661
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,520
Did anyone see him leave?

662
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,050
Anyone?

663
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,550
Keep the hostages here until I get back.

664
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,670
Mom!

665
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,390
Derek!

666
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,970
Oh, god...

667
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,650
They were going to kill me.

668
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,940
Jack saved my life.

669
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,710
He saves everyone's life.

670
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,230
Mrs. Huxley.

671
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,460
I need you and your son to follow me.

672
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,460
Can I see Jack Bauer?

673
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,330
I'm sorry.

674
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,890
I have instructions to transport you to CTU.

675
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,930
This way, please.

676
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,580
Mr. President.

677
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,990
- Congratulations.  - Thank you very much.

678
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,520
Thank you.

679
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,770
- Charles?  - Oh, watch your step.

680
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,370
I need to talk to you.

681
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,510
Sweetheart.

682
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,340
Smile. It's over.

683
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,400
Charles, I just need a few minutes alone with you.

684
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,780
Yes... soon.

685
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,940
No! Not soon.

686
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,950
Right now, this is very important.

687
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,540
Martha, when I am done with this, I'll call for you.

688
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,730
I promise.

689
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,190
All right, this ends now.

690
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,370
I have played my role without interfering.

691
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,370
Now it is time for you to attend to me.

692
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,610
And I will.

693
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,490
Charles, do not patronize me!

694
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,370
Something is going on.

695
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,140
I am not crying wolf again.

696
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,720
Martha.

697
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,650
Please.

698
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,530
Do not ruin this moment for me.

699
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,880
We'll talk later.

700
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,060
Martha.

701
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,810
Everything all right?

702
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,920
No.

703
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,270
It's not all right.

704
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,950
I have to talk to my husband.

705
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,490
The situation is more dangerous than he realizes.

706
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,470
Whoa, and what situation is that?

707
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,330
I'm sorry, Walt.

708
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,590
I can only talk to Charles about this.

709
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,410
Curtis just confirmed the area's been contained and their reporting,

710
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,240
only minor injuries among the hostages.

711
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,180
Good, thank you.

712
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,550
You should probably route all field updates through Mr. McGill for the time being.

713
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,440
Oh, okay.

714
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,990
Bill, If you have a moment.

715
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,310
Lynn, uh...

716
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,490
I owe you an apology.

717
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,390
For what?

718
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,830
Well, If you hadn't recognized the duress code

719
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,640
that Jack transmitted, well...

720
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,530
Bill, you're the reason I figured out what he was doing.

721
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,440
What do you mean?

722
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,630
Well, I admit, I was suspicious of Mr. Bauer,

723
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,270
but you were so adamant about his integrity that I just...

724
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,020
looked for a way to reconcile the contradiction, so...

725
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,140
thank you.

726
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,570
I assume Mr. Bauer's been taken into custody?

727
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,220
Well, I plan to debrief him here, but not as a suspect.

728
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,700
Well, he hasn't been officially cleared in the deaths of David Palmer or Michelle Dessler.

729
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,860
Well, based on mitigating evidence in Chloe O'Brian's testimony.

730
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,660
We're confident that Jack was framed for those murders.

731
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,860
I appreciate that,

732
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,130
but it still doesn't change a very tangled situation.

733
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,820
I mean, we have surveillance footage that places Jack Bauer

734
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,130
at the site of David Palmer's assassination.

735
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,480
Well, clearly, it was doctored.

736
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,120
Not according to preliminary tests.

737
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,780
If we're gonna get to the bottom of this,

738
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,910
Jack Bauer has a lot to answer for.

739
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,650
Bring him in. Now.

740
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,970
The rest of the terminal's clear.

741
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,650
Jack.

742
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,860
It's good to see you again.

743
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,090
It's good to see you.

744
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,000
We've got a problem.

745
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,290
One of the hostages is missing.

746
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,110
He was working with the terrorists.

747
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,410
Give me a description, I'll take care of it.

748
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,010
I'll help you now, let's go.

749
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,750
Jack, you need to go back to CTU.

750
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,050
Buchanan just gave orders to take you into custody.

751
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,380
I watched Beresch give this guy a key card.

752
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,790
Something else is going down here.

753
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,230
We've got to find this guy now.

754
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,820
And I'll get right on it.

755
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,670
But I need you to go with these men, please.

756
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,470
He's a white male,

757
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,340
mid-30s, wearing a dark suit and a yellow tie.

758
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,970
He's about five-eight.

759
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,200
We'll find him.

760
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,600
Okay, thanks.

761
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,200
These are my weapons.

762
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,340
Altieri, Hutchinson.

763
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,980
We have a possible sleeper among the hostages.

764
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,310
We're looking for a caucasian male,

765
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,680
five-eight, dark suit, yellow tie.

766
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,390
Where have you been?

767
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,430
We had a problem with Chevensky.

768
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,390
Where is he?

769
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,660
Dead.

770
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,690
You have the key?

771
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,050
Masks.

772
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,250
All right, now.

773
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,670
One, two, three.

774
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,120
Push it, push it.

775
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,060
Do you have the merchandise?

776
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,760
Yes, we're moving the canisters out now.

777
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,300
Good.

778
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,380
Transportation's been arranged.

779
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,970
Call me when you're out.

780
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,630
I will.

781
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:34,890
Today is a historic day for both the United States and Russia alike.

782
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:39,880
Presidents Logan and Suvarov, having signed the arms treaty agreement

783
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,320
which will impact on arms reduction between both countries

784
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,420
will now greet the press to discuss the unprecedented weight

785
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,540
of what has just been put in motion.

786
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,010
This will be remembered as a significant day for President Logan, perhaps...

787
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,150
Evelyn, did you get a chance to speak to my husband?

788
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


789
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,090
We have waited patiently for you 

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,660
to renounce this unholy pact with our oppressors,

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,950
but we have heard nothing.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,140
This is the cost of that silence.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,350
If you choose to sign this corrupt document,

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,510
understand that you will also be staining it

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,770
with the blood of the remaining hostages.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,850
If CTU can't pull this off in time,

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,350
that's upwards of 60 people, Mike.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,050
Mrs. Logan, if someone altered the recording of your conversation with David Palmer,

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,280
the President needs to know.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,430
Between the Summit and the hostage situation,

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,350
he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,250
Until the treaty's signed,

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm not letting this out of my sight.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,930
What did she tell you?

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,970
She said it was a transcript of the call she had with David Palmer.

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,720
I under President Logan wants us to go into the terminal as soon as possible.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,220
Yes, before the treaty is signed.

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,500
Curtis, what's your situation?

21
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,680
My men are in place

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,020
and we're setting the entry charges.

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,670
We should be able to make our entry on target.

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,640
I assume Mr. Bauer's been taken into custody?

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,030
Well, I plan to debrief him here.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,040
Bring him in. Now.

27
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,500
Diane, what's going on? What's wrong?

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,830
Derek is inside the terminal.

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,280
I see him.

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,280
He's with the other hostages but he's not hurt.

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,230
Please don't let anything happen to him.

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,450
This is not your fault.

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm the reason you went along with them.

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,980
This is not over.

35
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,470
We got a problem.

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,150
One of the hostages is missing.

37
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,480
He was working with the terrorists.

38
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,680
Give me a description, I'll take care of it.

39
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,160
I'll help you now, let's go.

40
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,860
Buchanan just gave orders to take you into custody.

41
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,360
I watched Beresch give this guy a key card.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,620
Something else is going down here.

43
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,950
We've got to find this guy now.

44
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,390
Police Department, S.W.A.T.

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,430
Sorry we have to bring you in like this, Jack.

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,550
It's all right, Mara, I understand.

47
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,350
A year and a half.

48
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,350
How did you manage to stay invisible for so long?

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,930
Apparently I wasn't as invisible as I should have been.

50
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,230
Tyler.

51
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,410
Mara, it's Curtis, put Bauer on.

52
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,900
It's Agent Manning.

53
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,710
Yeah?

54
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,300
Jack, you say the suspect was hiding among the hostages?

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,760
Yeah, right up until the assault began,

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,260
somewhere around 10:30.

57
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,950
Then he must have broken for an exit.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,630
What exit was closest?

59
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,190
Without an alarm?

60
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,580
Between gates six and seven.

61
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,460
- Thanks, Jack.  - Yeah.

62
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,310
Pull up external video starting at 10:30.

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,420
All cameras covering gates six and seven.

64
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,130
We're away.

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,040
Mrs. Logan?

66
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,310
Mrs. Logan?

67
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,210
Oh, my god.

68
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,780
Help!

69
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,380
Something's happened to the First Lady.

70
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,930
Get a doctor, now.

71
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,650
According to Jack, he should be between gates six and seven,

72
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,000
just outside this view.

73
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,500
I got this feed from ten minutes ago.

74
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,270
Try camera seven.

75
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,020
Camera four.

76
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,120
Tighten up.

77
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,330
Yellow Tie, got him.

78
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,900
Now let's follow him.

79
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,770
Damn it, what camera covers the adjacent sector?

80
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,180
14A, but it's a bad angle.

81
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,610
Pull it up, anyway, match the time codes.

82
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,090
Okay, got him.

83
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,490
This is two minutes, 25 seconds later.

84
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,090
What hangar is that?

85
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,000
Hangar Double-B.

86
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,630
Has it been searched yet?

87
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,390
No, it was outside the secured perimeter.

88
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,910
All right, I'm going to take a field team, head over there.

89
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,550
Send this infom to Comm.

90
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,390
Team A with me, let's go!

91
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,730
Hangar Double-B, let's go.

92
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
CTU, Stiles.

93
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,990
Edgar, Jack told us about a suspect hiding among the hostages.

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,230
We just picked up surveillance on him.

95
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,630
He entered Hangar Double-B at roughly 10:57.

96
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,400
Did you check it out yet?

97
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,550
No, we're going in now, I'll need comm.

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm on it, Chloe, what volume is airport facilities on?

99
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,650
Hennessy Four.

100
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,490
Team Two, cover the rear.

101
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,530
Check it out.

102
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,180
Everyone else, search the building.

103
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,940
See what you can find.

104
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,280
Craig, it's Curtis.

105
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,400
Send a forensics team down here now.

106
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,670
Tell them they'll need a full biopack with spectrum analyzers.

107
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,100
Any problems getting the canisters out?

108
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,430
No, they were hidden exactly where you said they'd be.

109
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,210
Everything on schedule with our transport?

110
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,270
Customs documents are being finalized at the port.

111
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,410
Good.

112
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,770
The Russians will finally understand the consequences of occupying our homeland

113
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,930
when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

114
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,340
When did this happen?

115
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,210
A few minutes ago.

116
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,230
I came back in and I found her on the bed.

117
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,280
What do you mean came back in?

118
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,210
You mean you left her alone.

119
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,710
What happened, Doctor? Is she all right?

120
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,710
She seems to be now,

121
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,230
but I'd have to do some tests to find out why she blacked out.

122
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,870
I didn't black out.

123
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,800
Someone did this to me, someone attacked me, Charles.

124
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,930
Shh, shh, Martha...

125
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,440
You have to do something, you have to do something.

126
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,580
They're trying to get me.

127
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,140
- No, no one's trying to get you.  - Yes!

128
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,720
- We just want you to be well.  - Honey, listen, listen, listen.

129
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,140
I had the proof

130
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,590
and now it's gone.

131
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,130
What proof? What are you talking about?

132
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:48,650
The proof that David Palmer called me to warn me about today.

133
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,860
Are we still on this?

134
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,060
We've never been off of it.

135
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,870
You just wouldn't listen to me.

136
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,100
Sir.

137
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,030
Is everything okay?

138
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,360
I think so.

139
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,000
No, No, damn it, it's not o... okay!

140
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,170
You people have got to listen to me.

141
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,750
I had a document from the archive room.

142
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,290
- Where was this document?  - I am trying to tell you.

143
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,740
It was hidden in my blouse.

144
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,390
It's gone, someone stole it from me.

145
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,160
Martha, you've been under a lot of stress.

146
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,070
We all have, let... let...

147
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,670
no, let Dr. Hill...

148
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,210
let Dr. Hill examine you

149
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,540
and we can figure out how to get you better.

150
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,170
You don't believe me.

151
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,240
You don't believe your own wife.

152
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,770
I have an important phone call from the Secretary of State that I have to get to.

153
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,940
If there's any sudden changes,

154
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,500
you get back to me as soon as possible.

155
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,200
Yes, Mr. President.

156
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,000
Charles, don't leave.

157
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,920
Honey, I'll be right down the hall.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,950
No, no, no, honey, honey, don't leave me.

159
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,480
- You need to get some rest.  - Please...

160
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,470
Close that door.

161
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,890
What do I do about this, Walt?

162
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,020
This is what she was like before you sent her to Vermont.

163
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,740
Are you suggesting that I readmit her?

164
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,660
You have to consider the option.

165
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,560
For her sake.

166
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,280
She said she'd rather die than go back in there.

167
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,070
Sir.

168
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,770
If she's going to persist with these conspiracy theories,

169
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,750
it's only a matter of time before she talks to someone who believes her.

170
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,730
Then we really will have a problem.

171
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,990
I wish you were wrong, but I don't think you are.

172
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,070
Do you want me to handle this, sir?

173
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,260
Make the arrangements,

174
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,410
but don't let Martha find out.

175
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,960
Let me be the one to tell her.

176
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,510
Yeah.

178
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,460
Have you handled the problem there?

179
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,290
Yes.

180
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,670
Martha Logan won't be giving us any more trouble.

181
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,720
Good.

182
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,320
Erwich has just completed transferring the gas to the semi

183
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,550
and is on his way to the port.

184
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,910
And the authorities don't know anything's been stolen?

185
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,970
Not yet.

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,690
Then the only thing we have left to take care of is Bauer.

187
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,640
Where is he?

188
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,120
On his way to CTU.

189
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,670
He's getting too close.

190
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
He's already started putting the pieces together.

191
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,210
I know, he needs to be taken out.

192
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,540
I'm handling it myself.

193
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,730
How?

194
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,740
Once he gets to CTU, your hitter won't be able to get near him.

195
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,220
I've have someone on the inside who can help us.

196
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,030
Then use him.

197
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,620
Done.

198
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,180
You sure those readings are right?

199
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,430
They're right.

200
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,020
2,000 parts per million.

201
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,660
That can only be military grade.

202
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,950
I'll tell him.

203
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,250
Where are you going?

204
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,610
I need you to finish the shell script.

205
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,550
Not now.

206
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,240
Since when do you say not now?

207
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,660
According to this, the hangar was leased to some offshore company,

208
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,330
but it's been vacant for at least 18 months.

209
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,380
Sir?

210
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,750
I just heard from Curtis.

211
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,790
He was right.

212
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,350
There was nerve gas in Hangar Double B.

213
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,550
That's what killed the rats.

214
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,480
There were trace amounts found in the animals' blood,

215
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,300
but the concentrations were definitely mil-spec weaponized.

216
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,450
So this man in the yellow tie,

217
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,970
the suspect that Bauer's telling us about

218
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,390
that's what he was doing at the airport?

219
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,610
Stealing canisters of nerve gas out of the hangar?

220
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,030
Stealing from whom?

221
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,550
Military destroyed its stockpiles years ago.

222
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,780
Well, maybe this nerve gas wasn't produced by the military.

223
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,920
Edgar, have forensics get a signature off the trace samples.

224
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,090
See if they can figure out who manufactured it.

225
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,360
Chloe, elevate our alert status.

226
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,360
Activate all available personnel and get Curtis back here.

227
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,600
We're gonna need everyone we have.

228
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,590
I wouldn't issue a statement about the First Lady for another couple days.

229
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,070
Let your successes today run front and center on all the networks.

230
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,700
That sounds right.

231
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,280
Dr. Hill, please, come in.

232
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,050
How's Martha doing?

233
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,480
Well, she's asleep now.

234
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,490
Have you figured out what caused the blackout?

235
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,550
I spoke with her psychiatrist, Dr. Carlstrom

236
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,400
and none of the medication she's been prescribing

237
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,010
would have caused this kind of collapse.

238
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,390
So we still don't know what it was.

239
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,410
Not yet, no.

240
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,020
Mr. President, I need to speak to you and Walt alone.

241
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,620
Thank you, Doctor.

242
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,070
Keep a close eye on her.

243
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,970
We'll talk soon.

244
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,660
Yes, Mr. President.

245
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,840
What's up, Mike?

246
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,130
I'm afraid the situation at the airport has taken an unexpected turn.

247
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,750
What's the problem?

248
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,490
The hostages were saved, we've captured or killed all the terrorists.

249
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,740
Not all of them.

250
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,900
One of the terrorists was posing as a hostage.

251
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,620
He used the hostage crisis to cover a theft.

252
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,580
A theft? What was stolen?

253
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,250
A cache of chemical weapons.

254
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,860
What kind of chemical weapons?

255
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,350
Nerve gas.

256
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,950
Is it ours?

257
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,670
No, sir.

258
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,560
CTU is still trying to source it.

259
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,580
But it was buried in a bunker at the airport.

260
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,910
It seems this man had another crew waiting for him there.

261
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,080
Do we have any idea what the terrorists are planning?

262
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,590
Well, they haven't made any demands or issued any threats yet.

263
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,990
Well, what are we doing to stop them?

264
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,640
CTU is running an interagency search effort.

265
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,350
They're coordinating ground operations,

266
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,670
filtering intelligence.

267
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,260
Has the press found out about this, yet?

268
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,360
No, sir, it's being kept internal.

269
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,780
Whatever retaliation we were bracing for an hour ago

270
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,280
is nothing compared to what these people are capable of doing now.

271
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,980
Sir, I'll assemble the Homeland Security team to discuss evacuation scenarios.

272
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,710
I sent everyone updates on the airport forensics.

273
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,910
What did you want me on next?

274
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,990
Check the task list.

275
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,550
You don't need to ask me every time you need something new to do.

276
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,940
I don't care if you are my boss

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,470
or if you regret sleeping with me last night.

278
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,310
No one talks to me like that.

279
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,860
Really? I just did.

280
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,750
Now, what's your problem?

281
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,070
I don't have a problem.

282
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,830
Then what do you want?

283
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,320
Nothing.

284
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,860
Edgar.

285
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,730
Look, I'm sorry that my private life hasn't remained private today.

286
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,660
I'm thinking the opposite.

287
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,390
What do you mean?

288
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,880
You're too private.

289
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,520
We've known each other for years.

290
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,010
And today I find out you're keeping secrets from me?

291
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,580
Haven't you ever taken a psychology class?

292
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,590
People keep secrets.

293
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,890
I don't.

294
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,930
Not from my friends.

295
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,380
Why didn't you tell me Jack was alive?

296
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,240
Oh, come on.

297
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,440
It's called national security.

298
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,620
Yeah, well, what about Spenser?

299
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,720
I didn't even know you two were going out.

300
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,640
Give me a break.

301
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay, when we find the nerve gas and the alert level drops,

302
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,130
we can have some chamomile tea

303
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,680
and I'll tell you all my secrets, okay?

304
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,320
You paged me.

305
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,030
Has Bauer arrived at CTU?

306
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,540
No, not yet.

307
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,400
When he does, I need you to do something.

308
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,530
We have our hands full searching for the nerve gas.

309
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,270
Bauer is a priority.

310
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,440
I need you to clear an entrance into CTU.

311
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,100
I'm sending it now.

312
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,170
Okay.

313
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,340
Miss Raines.

314
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,080
I'll get back to you. Yes?

315
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,650
I take it you're up to speed on the nerve gas stolen from the airport.

316
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,310
I was just filling in DOD.

317
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,780
Diane Huxley and her son were brought in to be debriefed.

318
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,370
I'd like you to interview her.

319
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,560
Interview her about what?

320
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,110
Any information she has that could help us find the nerve gas.

321
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,550
What could she possibly know about that?

322
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,510
I've reviewed the evidence against Jack Bauer

323
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,190
and I'm inclined to agree with your assessment

324
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,050
that he was framed for the assassination of David Palmer.

325
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,910
Thank you.

326
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,430
I also think that whoever framed Jack

327
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,980
is also involved with the theft of this nerve gas.

328
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,000
Which means that Diane Huxley could have had contact 

329
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,770
with that person without realizing it.

330
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,600
I... I'm not a trained interrogator.

331
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,800
But you know Jack Bauer better than anyone else in here.

332
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,710
You have something in common with this woman.

333
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
It might help her open up.

334
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,960
I realize it's awkward, but I need you to do it.

335
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,950
Fine.

336
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,400
I'll see what I can get from her.

337
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,000
Thank you.

338
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,990
Where is she?

339
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,920
She and her son just cleared security.

340
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,980
Mrs. Huxley, I'm Audrey Raines.

341
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,230
- Hi.  - Hello.

342
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,470
This is my son, Derek.

343
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,650
Hi. I'm gonna be asking you a few questions.

344
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,790
And Derek, I want you to be checked out by a doctor while I speak with your mother.

345
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,200
There's nothing wrong with me.

346
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,590
It's just procedure.

347
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,160
When you're done, you and I will speak.

348
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,660
Can you take him to medical, please?

349
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,940
It's okay, I'll see you in a bit.

350
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,260
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

351
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,670
Is Jack gonna be here soon?

352
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,430
He's on his way in.

353
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,420
Come with me.

354
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,130
I had no idea he worked in a place like this.

355
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,680
It's just up these stairs.

356
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,530
Did you know him before?

357
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,690
Yes.

358
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,960
I knew him.

359
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,840
A lot of people here thought you were dead until today.

360
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,430
Yeah, I know.

361
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,320
Excuse me.

362
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,470
Chloe.

363
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,070
Hi, Jack.

364
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,840
You all right?

365
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,460
Yeah, I'm okay.

366
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,220
We wouldn't have made it out of that airport without your help.

367
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,330
Thank you.

368
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,200
You're welcome.

369
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,840
Mr. Bauer, Lynn McGill from division.

370
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,700
Mara, I'll assume custody at this point, thank you.

371
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,760
You're no longer a suspect in President Palmer's murder,

372
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,830
but while you're here, you will need this.

373
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,150
It'll give you level two clearance.

374
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,010
Thank you, was Agent Manning able to apprehend the suspect?

375
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,790
No.

376
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,420
It seems the person you identified

377
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,470
used the hostage situation as a cover

378
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,130
to steal a cache of weaponized nerve gas from the airport.

379
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,250
Nerve gas? How do you know that?

380
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,730
Following your lead, Curtis found trace amounts in a hangar adjacent to the terminal.

381
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,650
We don't know how much there is and where it came from,

382
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,750
but it is a military grade chemical weapon.

383
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,680
Do you have any leads?

384
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,860
Not yet, but we're gonna run the search operation from here.

385
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,530
You're not gonna be able to track these terrorists

386
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,440
fast enough with a standard search operation.

387
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,470
The only way you're gonna get that nerve gas in time

388
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,290
is if you find out who ordered the hit on David Palmer.

389
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,630
I agree.

390
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,800
I think David Palmer was about to expose this plot.

391
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,250
I think that's why he was killed.

392
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,770
I also think that if you can help us identify who framed you,

393
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,790
we can intercept this nerve gas while there's still time.

394
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,030
Hello, Jack.

395
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,260
Hey, Bill.

396
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,080
President's been informed of the nerve gas.

397
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,800
He wants to ensure the media doesn't find out.

398
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,790
Well, make sure Division restricts information flow.

399
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,080
We'll continue this conversation when I'm done.

400
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,490
Good to see you again, Jack.

401
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,900
It's good to see you, too, Bill.

402
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,790
I'm so sorry about Michelle.

403
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,860
I never meant to put her in jeopardy.

404
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,900
Of course, you didn't.

405
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,870
How's Tony doing?

406
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,530
He's still unconscious,

407
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,410
but the doctor says he's going to pull through.

408
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,880
Good.

409
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,920
We're gonna need to speak to him as soon as possible.

410
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,790
They know to call us.

411
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,750
Jack... Audrey has been working for us.

412
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,390
She's here in the building now?

413
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,010
She's debriefing Diane Huxley.

414
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,070
Why is she talking to Diane?

415
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,900
Lynn asked her to.

416
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,270
I'm not used to calling him Jack.

417
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,850
He said his name was Frank Flynn.

418
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,010
I thought he worked for the oil company.

419
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,750
You probably know more about him than I do.

420
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,980
We all thought he was dead for the last year and a half.

421
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,750
So what do you want to know?

422
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,560
You said that Jack was living with you for the last six months.

423
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,450
Is that correct?

424
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,750
He was renting a room.

425
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,960
So, you don't have a personal relationship with him?

426
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,810
I'm not sure that's any of your business.

427
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,890
I'm sorry, I just...

428
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,530
I need to know how close you and Jack were.

429
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,420
Whether he confided in you or not.

430
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,610
Jack's a private person.

431
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,340
I always knew he was keeping something from me.

432
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,710
I just never pushed it.

433
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,410
I accepted him for who he was.

434
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,640
Miss. Raines.

435
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,690
Whoever he was before...

436
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,690
it doesn't change the way I feel about him.

437
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,350
He was good to me, he was good to my son.

438
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,400
He meant a lot to us.

439
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,850
He still does.

440
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,380
I see.

441
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,240
Did anyone ever come by and ask about Jack?

442
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,950
What do you mean?

443
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,180
Someone knew that Jack was alive.

444
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,000
It's critical to our investigation that we find out who that was.

445
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,860
No, no one asked about him.

446
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,170
No one ever came to see him.

447
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,470
Can you excuse me for a minute, please?

448
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,020
Yeah.

449
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,990
Jack.

450
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,660
I don't even know where to begin.

451
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,820
You have to believe me.

452
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,630
I couldn't tell you I was still alive.

453
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,560
Jack, you don't need to apologize.

454
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,680
I did it for your own protection.

455
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,460
It's been hard for me, thinking that you died.

456
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,450
Believing that I was angry at you

457
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,040
and that I hated you.

458
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,130
I wasn't able to forgive myself for that.

459
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,270
You had every reason to hate me.

460
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,790
I was responsible for Paul's death.

461
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,130
- I lied to you.  - Jack.

462
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,620
You made a hard decision.

463
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,160
I never imagined I'd get another chance to tell you this.

464
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,150
But I want...

465
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,010
I want you to know that I don't blame you

466
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,780
for what happened with Paul.

467
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,310
Thank you.

468
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,250
Jack.

469
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,470
There's so much that I want to say to you, I know its...

470
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,310
Mr. Bauer, Mr. Buchanan needs to see you.

471
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,130
I'll be right down.

472
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,990
I should go.

473
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,610
Evelyn, is Mrs. Logan still asleep?

474
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,600
Yes, she's finally getting some rest.

475
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,730
Good.

476
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,620
You should probably start gathering some of her things.

477
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,680
I thought the president was staying through the weekend.

478
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,310
He is... but she'll be leaving today.

479
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,390
Where's she going?

480
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,510
Just make sure she has the essentials to make her trip comfortable.

481
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,030
Yes, sir.

482
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,080
Edgar said he saw you come in here.

483
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,060
- What are you doing?  - Setting up a new socket.

484
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,990
We're overloaded from the NSA database.

485
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,170
Why are you here?

486
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,700
Looking for you.

487
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,100
What for?

488
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,260
I need to get into your utilities volume.

489
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,480
Why didn't you message me?

490
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,990
Okay, I wanted to say something, too.

491
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,640
Let's not make a big drama out of it.

492
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,930
What?

493
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,140
I was unfairly harsh to you a few minutes ago.

494
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,610
I didn't mean anything.

495
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,370
All right.

496
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,820
Apology accepted.

497
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,970
It wasn't really an apology.

498
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,510
It was more of an observation.

499
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,200
I mean, the fact...

500
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,110
Spenser.

501
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,130
Damn it, why do I do that?

502
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,320
Edgar Stiles.

503
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,500
It's Chloe.

504
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,440
What is it?

505
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,620
I need to know Spenser's clearance level?

506
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,670
Why are you asking?

507
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,460
Spenser works for me and I need to know his clearance level.

508
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,400
So could you please open the header file

509
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,040
and give it to me, Edgar?

510
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,330
Fine.

511
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,710
Level three.

512
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,800
Chloe?

513
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,790
Call Buchanan, tell him I need to talk to him now.

514
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,330
It's important.

515
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,130
Division sent me.

516
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,070
One of your mainframe servers is cycling slow.

517
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,480
You're not on the manifest.

518
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,050
I was told it'd be taken care of.

519
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,970
I'm going to have to clear this with the systems administrator.

520
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,510
- Are you Hank, from Onsite Support?  - Yeah.

521
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,290
My fault.

522
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,150
I was supposed to advance him an emergency clearance.

523
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,060
All right.

524
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,570
Place the bag on the conveyor belt

525
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,240
and walk right through, sir.

526
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,570
All clear.

527
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,930
Thank you.

528
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,140
Thank you.

529
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,040
I'll show you the way.

530
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,550
Mr. Cummings told me it would be best to keep you off the manifest.

531
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,350
Classified material generally runs on servers nine and twelve.

532
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,230
All the information you need on Bauer should be there.

533
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,170
I don't know what files Mr. Cummings asked you to download,

534
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,890
but you need to keep vector counts the same

535
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,820
or it'll get flagged.

536
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,820
I got it.

537
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,620
Okay.

538
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,660
I need to get back to my station.

539
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,280
Evelyn, what are you doing?

540
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,240
Mrs. Logan, are you feeling better?

541
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,340
Why are you packing my things?

542
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,510
Walt Cummings asked me to.

543
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,950
Why?

544
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,800
Where are we going?

545
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,000
I don't know if the president's going with you.

546
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,850
Evelyn, stop, what's going on?

547
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,170
They just asked me to get you ready to leave.

548
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,130
They're sending me to Vermont, aren't they?

549
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,700
Charles is having me committed.

550
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,870
I'm sorry, Mrs. Logan.

551
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,660
I honestly don't know anything else.

552
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,520
It's fine.

553
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,450
I'll getting dressed.

554
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,610
Edgar, my FGA is locked.

555
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,770
Where's Chloe?

556
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,350
How should I know?

557
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,660
Can you unlock this?

558
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,880
No.

559
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,860
Mr. Wolff?

560
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,430
Please come with us.

561
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,340
What do you want?

562
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,460
Mr. Buchanan has ordered us to take you to him immediately.

563
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,240
I'm in the middle of a critical task here.

564
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,950
Mr. Stiles has been authorized to take over your work load.

565
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,940
Did you know about this, Edgar?

566
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,650
Yeah, I just got the bulletin.

567
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,090
Sorry.

568
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,890
Mr. Wolff.

569
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,950
Please.

570
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,690
I'm coming.

571
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,250
Chloe?

572
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,010
Sir.

573
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,200
What is going on here?

574
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,880
Sit down, Spenser.

575
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,430
You've been burrowing into classified CTU protocols without authorization.

576
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,570
I don't know what you're talking about.

577
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,000
Stop, I know you were logged onto the security subsystem,

578
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,760
where you had no right to be.

579
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,680
We're going through your system.

580
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,670
So you might as well tell us now what you were doing.

581
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,440
- I told you I was opening...  - That's enough!

582
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,720
You've accessed files outside your clearance level

583
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,230
at least 18 times in the four months you've been here.

584
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,900
Sir, whatever you think you've found.

585
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,520
It's a mistake.

586
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,800
I've done nothing wrong.

587
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,310
Come on, Spenser, you obviously have your own agenda here.

588
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,500
I don't have an agenda.

589
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,770
And while you're at it, why don't you explain

590
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,490
why it was necessary to crawl into my bed.

591
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,070
Which certainly wasn't what it appeared to be,

592
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,800
just like your work here isn't what it appears to be!

593
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,780
Chloe, Chloe.

594
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,010
Chloe, let me handle this, please.

595
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,210
Sir, obviously you can't take anything she says into consideration.

596
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,170
I was careless

597
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,410
and inadvertently.

598
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,390
I caused her some emotional pain.

599
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,430
Oh, please.

600
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,900
And now she's trying to get back at me.

601
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,930
I don't think so, Spenser.

602
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,330
Sir, I'd like to talk to a lawyer.

603
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,060
Forget about a lawyer!

604
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,060
We're in the middle of a terrorist crisis.

605
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,450
There are lives on the line.

606
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,430
You're going to tell us what you've been doing here

607
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,910
and you're going to tell us now.

608
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,540
I hope this goes better than when I sent her up there the last time.

609
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,020
Dr. Hill and his staff are on stand by if she overreacts.

610
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,280
I'm not looking forward to this.

611
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,540
Evelyn?

612
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,690
Mr. President.

613
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,780
Where is she?

614
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,860
She's in the bathroom, sir.

615
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,440
Martha?

616
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,010
Marty?

617
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,990
Are you sure she's in there?

618
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,260
Yes, sir, she's getting dressed.

619
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,570
Marty?

620
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,530
Aaron?

621
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,920
My wife is gone.

622
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,980
This is Pierce.

623
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,110
We have a priority alert.

624
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,130
The First Lady has left her quarters and is unaccounted for.

625
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,070
All agents in the main wing, move to points north and west.

626
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,150
Anyone spotting her, check in immediately.

627
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,360
So the only people who knew you were alive

628
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,190
were David Palmer, Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler and Chloe O'Brian.

629
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,150
Yeah, and at least one other person who killed David Palmer

630
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,870
and tried to frame me for it.

631
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,790
And you don't know who that other person might be?

632
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,970
No.

633
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,500
Any theories?

634
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,720
About a year and a half ago, David Palmer called me.

635
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,740
Told me there's someone in Logan's administration targeting me.

636
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,220
Which is why you faked your own death and assumed a new identity?

637
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,560
Yeah, except it didn't work.

638
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,380
I believe that whoever tried to kill me 18 months ago.

639
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,320
Somehow found out I was still alive

640
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,900
and waited until today to exploit that information.

641
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,990
Someone inside President Logan's administration?

642
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,110
That's what David Palmer told me a year and a half ago

643
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,480
and I believe him.

644
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,120
Well, first of all, that would mean

645
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,500
someone in this administration is also tied to the theft of the nerve gas.

646
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,780
Yeah, you're going to have to look into that.

647
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,750
Well, even if you're right,

648
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,600
there are hundreds of people in Logan's administration.

649
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,570
It would take an investigation of that magnitude months to gain any traction

650
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,050
and we don't have months to work with.

651
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,900
Mr. McGill, I'm sorry to interrupt.

652
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,720
But Dr. Paulson is calling from medical.

653
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,820
Put him through.

654
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,760
Mr. McGill?

655
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,380
Yes?

656
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,220
Tony Almeida's regained consciousness and is in recovery.

657
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,270
Can he talk?

658
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,740
Yes, he's very weak.

659
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,100
You'll have to be brief.

660
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,860
Let him know I'll be down in a few minutes.

661
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,410
Tony asked if be could speak to Jack Bauer first.

662
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,480
He says it's important.

663
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,760
He's a friend of mine.

664
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,470
Tell Mr. Almeida that Jack will be down in few moments.

665
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,730
I'll let him know.

666
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,760
Thank you.

667
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,480
I'll be right back.

668
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,350
Jack.

669
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,400
What's going on?

670
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,760
I know you're busy.

671
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,150
I...

672
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,010
I just wanted to apologize.

673
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,850
You have nothing to apologize for.

674
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,310
Yes, I do.

675
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,000
I thought you were just another loser,

676
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,530
trying to take advantage of my mom.

677
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,040
I was wrong.

678
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,470
You were trying to protect her.

679
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,260
Your mother is lucky to have someone who loves her as much as you do.

680
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,060
As soon as this is over, I promise you,

681
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,180
you and I are going to get a chance to sit down and talk.

682
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,550
But right now, I have to go.

683
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,790
Yeah.

684
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,070
Take care of your mother.

685
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,720
Who gave you the Level Five authorization?

686
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,720
Don't look at me. Answer him!

687
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,210
I can't.

688
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,440
I can't talk to anyone here about this.

689
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,320
Whatever you were doing is over, Spenser.

690
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,530
Sir, I was able to pull Spenser's screen activity from the archive.

691
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,040
This is what he was looking at ten minutes ago.

692
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,200
Looks like he was using in house surveillance to track someone through CTU.

693
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,290
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer?

694
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,510
- What the hell's going on here, Spenser?  - I was following orders.

695
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,680
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer, they have a reason.

696
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,780
Who is they?

697
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,420
I won't say anything else.

698
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,420
Chloe, find security, have them locate Jack now.

699
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,920
Dr. Paulson?

700
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,780
Yes.

701
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,430
I'm Jack Bauer.

702
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,870
Tony Almeida wanted to speak with me.

703
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,870
Oh, of course, Mr. Bauer.

704
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,510
Just remember to please keep it brief.

705
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,190
Thank you, sir.

706
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,000
Tony.

707
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,720
Tony, it's Jack.

708
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,680
Jack, you all right?

709
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,100
I think he cracked my rib.

710
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,380
I've been trying to reach you, but the lines were locked out.

711
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,000
What happened? Who is he?

712
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,640
I don't know, but he's a professional.

713
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,730
He killed Dr. Paulson, then he tried to kill me.

714
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,860
You have any idea how he got into CTU?

715
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,450
We identified a mole working in Chloe's department.

716
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,130
Who?

717
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,650
Spenser Wolff.

718
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,520
We've been interrogating him, but he hasn't talked yet.

719
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,170
- Where is he?  - Holding.

720
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,870
Get a doctor down here to monitor Tony Almeida now.

721
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,270
Lock this room down.

722
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,110
Contact Lynn McGill, have him meet me in Holding.

723
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,760
Bring up visual surveillance on Medical Room Two.

724
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,120
Open the door.

725
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,870
I want to show you something. Get up!

726
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,140
Did you let that man into CTU?

727
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,930
This man is a professional assassin.

728
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,550
He just killed Dr. Paulson and he tried to kill me.

729
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,080
Did you let him into CTU?

730
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,560
No, they told me he was here to place a tap on one of the servers.

731
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,020
- That's all I knew.  - Who told you?

732
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,050
I was here as part of an internal affairs investigation.

733
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,200
Are you starting to understand how much trouble you are in?

734
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,950
Now, I'm gonna give you one more chance.

735
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,340
Who told you to let that man into CTU?

736
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,890
The White House.

737
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,800
Mr. Cummings in the White House.

738
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,000
Cummings recruited me after I started working here.

739
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:08,010
He said that they wanted to make sure CTU was operating within the rules.

740
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,110
You have to believe me.

741
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,760
I thought I was serving the President.

742
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,730
Yeah, take him back to Holding.

743
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,030
Walt Cummings killed David Palmer and he tried to have me killed.

744
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:35,510
Even if it is true, we have to build a case before we call the President.

745
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,420
We don't call the President.

746
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,640
He's here in California, we go see him now.

747
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,580
Cummings is the President's Chief of Staff, Jack,

748
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,640
and his friend.

749
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,260
Without any hard evidence, CTU can't touch him.

750
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,980
I'm not CTU.

751
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,000
I'll go get Walt Cummings myself.

752
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


753
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,050
Any problems getting the canisters out?

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,030
No, they were hidden exactly where you said they'd be.

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,950
Russians will finally understand the consequences

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,580
of occupying our homeland when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,740
Erwich has just cleared airport security.

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,940
Then the authorities don't know anything's been stolen?

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,830
- Not yet.  - Then the only thing we have left to take care of is Bauer.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,760
You paged me?

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,020
I need you to do something.

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,180
We have our hands full searching for the nerve gas.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,260
Bauer is a priority.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,670
I just signed a treaty.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,200
Now all of a sudden I find out that the terrorists

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,270
are still out there... with nerve gas.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,930
You people have to listen to me.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
I had a document.

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,410
It was hidden in my blouse.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,830
It's gone, someone stole it from me.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,130
This is what she was like before you sent her to Vermont.

20
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,590
Are you suggesting that I readmit her?

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,200
For her sake, if nothing else.

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,890
Aaron, my wife is gone.

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,560
We have a priority alert.

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,070
You've been burrowing into classified CTU protocols without authorization.

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

26
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,230
Stop, I know you logged on to the security subsystem where you had no right to be.

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,520
Someone knew that Jack was alive.

28
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,850
It's critical to our investigation that we find out who that was.

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,800
Did you let that man into CTU?

30
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,400
This man is a professional assassin.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,570
He just killed Dr. Paulson, he tried to kill me.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,150
Who told you to let that man into CTU?

33
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,680
The White House.

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,270
Mr. Cummings.

35
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,260
I don't understand the problem.

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,120
David Palmer was murdered because he was about

37
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,220
to expose Walt Cummings connection to the terrorists.

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,040
When Cummings failed to frame me for Palmer's murder,

39
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,280
he tried to kill me.

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,370
All that may be true, Jack, but we don't have proof.

41
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,690
We can prove that Cummings used Spenser to get Jack's assassin into CTU.

42
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,920
All we have is Spenser's word, that's not enough to build a case.

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,530
You don't have time to build a case.

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,730
You want the nerve gas, Cummings is your connection.

45
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,440
Cummings is the President's Chief Advisor.

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,370
How exactly do you suggest we get to him?

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,080
I can secretly meet with Mike Novick, enlist his help.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,010
How do we know Novick's not in this with Cummings?

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,170
Because I know him, he'll listen to me.

50
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,210
And the President will listen to him.

51
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,170
With Novick's help, we can isolate Cummings.

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,380
Jack, as much as I appreciate you wanting to be involved,

53
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,440
you don't work here anymore.

54
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,490
That's exactly the reason why I should do this.

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,610
If it backfires, there'll be no fallout on you.

56
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,460
I think it's worth a try.

57
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,240
I agree.

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,110
It's your call.

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
All right, Jack.

60
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,310
But just so we're clear.

61
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,820
This is about finding the nerve gas.

62
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,490
Not getting revenge for David Palmer.

63
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,100
Understood.

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,020
Work out your protocols with Miss. Raines.

65
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,100
We'll keep looking through Cummings' background for anything that supports our case.

66
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,690
We're gonna need to set up a secure channel for you to contact us on.

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,620
Can you bring up the satellite photo of the compound?

68
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,610
Jack, I'm sorry if I'm being a little distant.

69
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,120
I just...

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,710
it's taking me a little while to get used to you being alive.

71
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,960
I understand.

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,490
I'll call Novick.

73
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,190
Jack.

74
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,160
When Cummings finds out that you're still alive,

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,880
he's gonna come after you again.

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,950
Yeah.

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,630
Yes?

78
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,900
Is Bauer dead?

79
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,250
I haven't received confirmation yet.

80
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,630
Your man should have taken care of this by now.

81
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,310
Perhaps he had to alter his strike window.

82
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,980
Has the nerve gas reached the port?

83
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,200
Not yet.

84
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,320
But they should be arriving any minute.

85
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,860
Good, I have to go.

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm late for a briefing.

87
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,640
You have all the shipping documents in order?

88
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
The canisters will arrive at port in your country in eight days.

89
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,640
Ground transportation to your base camp will take another day.

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,870
Will you need my help getting them to your target?

91
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,500
No, I've arranged transport to Moscow.

92
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,010
Have they found my wife yet?

93
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,180
No, sir, but Secret Service is confident

94
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,130
she's still on the grounds.

95
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,420
If they're so damn confident, why can't anyone find her?

96
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,700
What the hell are they doing?

97
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,550
I'm sure it's just a matter of time, Mr. President.

98
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,750
Sorry I'm late.

99
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,140
I was just setting up the video.

100
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,870
This was made by terrorists

101
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,080
to document the effects of exposure to nerve gas.

102
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,160
It was recovered from a training camp two years ago.

103
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,610
Disorientation occurs moments after exposure.

104
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,710
Now the video jumps forward,

105
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,010
no more than a couple of minutes, we estimate.

106
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:26,860
Within that time,

107
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,900
there's permanent damage to the central nervous system.

108
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,230
Violent seizures take over.

109
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,730
Bronchial membranes blister and peel away.

110
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,160
Death occurs within...

111
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,560
Stop.

112
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,180
Now, according to DOD,

113
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,900
the Sentox-6 nerve gas stolen from the airport

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,390
is far more lethal than the gas we just saw used.

115
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,350
If released in a town or city, for example,

116
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,650
the cloud will remain lethal for much longer.

117
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,380
Are we any closer to finding the canisters?

118
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,950
There haven't been any reports of progress, sir.

119
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,130
Excuse me, Mr. President.

120
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,470
I need to return a call to the State Department.

121
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,170
Do you have those updates, Walt?

122
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,030
Yes, here's one from CTU.

123
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,390
Also one from Homeland Security.

124
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,300
This is Bauer.

125
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,740
Jack. Mike Novick.

126
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,590
It's good to hear your voice.

127
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,380
Yours, too, Mike.

128
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,610
I'm so sorry about David Palmer.

129
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,320
I know how much he meant to you.

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,930
Yeah... what's going on?

131
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,600
I have a lead on the stolen nerve gas.

132
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,000
Isn't CTU coordinating the search?

133
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,080
This is something I need to bring directly to you.

134
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,740
I don't understand.

135
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,750
I can't talk about it on the phone, Mike.

136
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,190
We need to meet.

137
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,420
No one can know about this, not even the President.

138
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,230
I'm not comfortable with all this secrecy, Jack.

139
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,390
You need to give me some idea what this is about.

140
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,420
It concerns Walt Cummings.

141
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,770
There's an area a few hundred yards outside the southwest gate.

142
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,580
It's at the far side of the property from the main house.

143
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,610
Thanks, Mike, I'll see you in 15 minutes.

144
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,430
Jack.

145
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,670
Hey.

146
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,020
They said we can leave soon.

147
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,470
I know, I heard.

148
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,230
What about you?

149
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,440
Are you coming home with us?

150
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,080
No, I need to stay here, CTU still needs my help.

151
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,520
Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?

152
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,900
Yeah, of course.

153
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,420
Take him downstairs.

154
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,140
She'll be there soon.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,260
You're not coming back to us at all, are you?

156
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,570
No.

157
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,050
I never thought I was going to be back here at CTU.

158
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,460
I would never have gotten you involved in all of this, I promise you.

159
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,900
It's the woman who interviewed me, isn't it? Audrey Raines.

160
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,610
You were involved with her.

161
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,340
I could tell by the way you looked at each other.

162
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,160
I was with her before I had to disappear.

163
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,070
Are you still in love with her?

164
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,210
Yes.

165
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,040
Does she still love you?

166
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,870
I don't know.

167
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,080
Mr. Bauer.

168
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,430
Your transportation's standing by.

169
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,080
I'll be right there.

170
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,940
I'm sorry, I have to go.

171
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Yeah.

172
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,050
Thank you.

173
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,060
Yeah.

174
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,970
Thank you.

175
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm not comfortable with all this secrecy, Jack.

176
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,850
You need to give me some idea what this is about.

177
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,740
It concerns Walt Cummings.

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,060
There's an area

179
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,980
a few hundred yards outside the southwest gate.

180
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,260
It's at the far side of the property from the main house.

181
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,440
- Your man didn't do his job.  - Don't put that on me, Nathanson.

182
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,600
You were supposed to have Bauer killed hours ago.

183
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm not going to warn you again.

184
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,660
Pull yourself together.

185
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,710
You heard the call, didn't you?

186
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,860
Bauer's coming here to expose my role in all this.

187
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,380
You're assuming he knows the extent of it.

188
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,310
Well, it's obvious he knows enough.

189
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,470
Now, what the hell am I supposed to do?

190
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,100
At this point, there's only one thing you can do.

191
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,840
Mrs. Logan.

192
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,840
Please come out of there.

193
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,510
Mrs. Logan.

194
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,140
Aaron.

195
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,880
Don't let them take me.

196
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,070
You've got to listen to me.

197
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,820
They're just trying to help you.

198
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,090
No, no.

199
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,460
They're trying to set me up.

200
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,990
They're trying to make it look like I had a breakdown,

201
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,310
so they can cart me off to some psychiatric hospital.

202
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,350
- Madam...  - Aaron.

203
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,940
It's someone in my husband's administration.

204
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,530
They're trying to shut me up because I know the truth.

205
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,440
What truth?

206
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,050
David Palmer.

207
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,450
I know...

208
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,160
Don't let him take me, Aaron, please?

209
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,820
We have our orders, Mrs. Logan.

210
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,310
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,740
Aaron... please...

212
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,830
Aaron.

213
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,320
Audrey, did you check with the airports?

214
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,420
Yes, they've all been alerted on the missing canisters.

215
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,790
- And C.H.P.?  - Same thing.

216
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,770
Trucks are being checked at all major interstates.

217
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,740
Make sure there's no mention of the Sentox nerve gas.

218
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,810
The White House is clear about that.

219
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,360
Yes, I know, the bulletin only describes the missing canisters.

220
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,710
There's no mention of chemical weapons.

221
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,570
Good, the last thing we need is for the public to find out

222
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,620
that nerve gas is out there.

223
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,040
Schaeffer.

224
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,090
What were you doing in there?

225
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,750
Making sure the canisters were secured properly.

226
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,430
Don't want them knocking around when this gets loaded onto a ship.

227
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,320
My men secured the canisters according to my instructions.

228
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,060
You don't need to be concerned.

229
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,580
All right.

230
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,800
Here are the customs documents you need when the shipment arrives,

231
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,500
along with the remote trigger and the arming codes.

232
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,760
I'll take the rest of my payment now.

233
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,970
Our arrangement was you'll get your final installment when the ship left port.

234
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,120
There's not gonna be a problem, they're loading out in less than an hour.

235
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,940
Then you won't have long to wait.

236
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,390
Fine.

237
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,690
I'll be right there.

238
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,370
Miss. Raines?

239
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,590
Yes.

240
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,690
We've been released.

241
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,930
Oh, good.

242
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,550
Can I ask you something?

243
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,600
Of course.

244
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,470
Do you still have feelings for Jack?

245
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,850
I'm sorry, but that's personal.

246
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,720
I know, but he's been living with my son and me for the last six months.

247
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,110
We started to become a family...

248
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,410
and I care about him.

249
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,240
Do you know he still loves you?

250
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,640
If you don't love him, let him go.

251
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,800
Bauer.

252
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,060
Jack, it's Audrey.

253
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,100
What's going on?

254
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,640
Jack.

255
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,860
What?

256
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,690
Audrey, what?

257
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,870
When this is over, are you coming back?

258
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,290
I don't know.

259
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,960
Are you going back to Diane?

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,460
No...

261
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,130
I don't know what I'm doing yet.

262
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,420
I haven't had any time to think about it.

263
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Is it true what she said?

264
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,500
What'd she say?

265
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,800
That you still love me.

266
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,770
I never stopped loving you...

267
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,230
not for one second.

268
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,080
Then don't go away again, Jack, please.

269
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,060
It's more complicated than that.

270
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,980
I know.

271
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,500
It's time.

272
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,410
I gotta go.

273
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,550
Jack...

274
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,520
I have to go.

275
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,210
Yeah, I know, I know, okay, bye.

276
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,700
No, no! Keep me out of this!

277
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,040
The last thing I want to do is about the roadblocks going up.

278
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,540
And we can't have any leaks about the nerve gas.

279
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,100
It would just cause a panic.

280
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,570
Come in.

281
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,930
Pardon me, sir, we found Mrs. Logan.

282
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,590
Is she all right?

283
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
She's fine, sir.

284
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,230
She was hiding in the stables.

285
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,090
Stables? What the hell did she think she was doing?

286
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,630
Mr. President...

287
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,110
I feel awkward mentioning this, but...

288
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,460
Mrs. Logan said some things.

289
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,810
About David Palmer.

290
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,220
Yes, sir.

291
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,770
I've heard her conspiracy theories, Aaron.

292
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,370
I've heard them all.

293
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,760
But thank you for your concern, Aaron.

294
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,230
They found my wife.

295
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,420
Good.

296
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,870
Mr. President... we need to talk.

297
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,640
What is it, Walt?

298
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,850
I was hoping to spare you from this,

299
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,290
but I'm afraid Jack Bauer is forcing my hand.

300
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,940
He's on his way here to meet with Mike Novick.

301
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,230
Bauer? Why?

302
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,720
He's going to accuse me of helping the terrorists acquire the nerve gas.

303
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,990
That's ridiculous.

304
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,540
No, sir.

305
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,350
It's the truth.

306
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,560
What did you say?

307
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,240
Through a proxy, I leaked information to the terrorists

308
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,270
about where the nerve gas was hidden.

309
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,530
You have to understand, sir.

310
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,730
This gas was never going to pose a threat to American lives.

311
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,040
Never pose a threat?

312
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,630
People died in the airport!

313
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,300
Hostages were killed!

314
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,750
We had hoped to limit the collateral damage.

315
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,240
Collateral damage? What are you thinking?

316
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,700
This is an unspeakable crime.

317
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,730
Walt... you have to answer for this.

318
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,450
Mr. President... it's in your best interest to hear me out

319
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,140
before you make that phone call.

320
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,080
What do you mean my best interest?

321
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,970
Sentox gas is being smuggled out of the country by separatists

322
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,740
who think they are going to use it against the Russians.

323
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,460
However, that nerve gas will never reach Russian soil.

324
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,430
And you know this how?

325
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,140
We control the remote detonators on those gas canisters.

326
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,650
As soon as they reach the terrorists base,

327
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,490
we'll trigger the canisters by satellite

328
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,990
and release the gas.

329
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,570
So everything that happened today was just to kill a some terrorists?

330
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,190
No, the goal is to produce a smoking gun.

331
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,780
Proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Central Asia.

332
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,130
This is unbelievable.

333
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,670
It's necessary.

334
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,110
It will finally give us a pretext

335
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,410
to increase our military presence in the region.

336
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,080
Guaranteeing the flow of oil for the next generation.

337
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,870
How dare you.

338
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,630
How dare you act without my consent.

339
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,210
How dare you put this administration and this entire country in jeopardy.

340
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,200
You're a traitor.

341
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,190
No, no, Mr. President, I am a patriot!

342
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,090
Doing what needs to be done for 

343
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,750
the continued safety and well being of this nation!

344
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,670
My god...

345
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,460
you gave the order to have David Palmer killed.

346
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,000
That was an unfortunate, but necessary intervention.

347
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,310
He found out too much and we had...

348
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,190
Walt!

349
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,890
You're rationalizing murder, the murder of a president.

350
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,270
You're going to contact these people

351
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,210
and recover the nerve gas before it leaves the country.

352
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,440
- I'm afraid I can't do that.  - Why not?

353
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,420
I don't know where the nerve gas is.

354
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,030
And the man I have working inside has gone dark, he's unreachable.

355
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,170
Now, you'll let things play out as they are.

356
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,770
Otherwise, your administration will be implicated

357
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,520
and your presidency will be destroyed.

358
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,310
It's your choice, Mr. President.

359
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,850
Jack.

360
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,850
Thanks for seeing me like this, Mike.

361
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,750
What is it?

362
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,350
Did you tell anyone we were meeting?

363
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,850
Of course not.

364
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,350
Son of a bitch!

365
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,850
Who did you tell?

366
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,950
Who did you tell?

367
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,850
I didn't tell anybody, Jack!

368
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,850
Jack Bauer, stay right where you are.

369
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,550
Put down your weapons and put your hands up.

370
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,850
What's the meaning of this?

371
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,450
Tell your men to stand down!

372
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,150
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.

373
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,650
He's here at my request!

374
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,150
We have orders to use force if necessary.

375
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,450
Orders? From who?

376
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,550
The President of the United States.

377
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,450
Get on your knees.

378
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,450
Thanks.

379
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,950
Novick and Bauer have been taken into custody.

380
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,450
So we're just gonna lock Mike Novick up?

381
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,350
For the time being.

382
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,150
What good will it do?

383
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,450
Eventually, he's gonna get out

384
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,550
and he's gonna talk to the press.

385
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,550
What can he say?

386
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,850
He doesn't know anything.

387
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,650
I thought you told me he talked to Jack Bauer.

388
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,650
We stopped Bauer before he could give Mike any details.

389
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,650
What's he gonna think?

390
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,550
We're detaining him.

391
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,750
Bauer was about to divulge national security secrets

392
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,150
that Mike's not authorized to hear.

393
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,650
That's why Mike's being detained.

394
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,550
And what about Bauer?

395
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,750
He must have talked to other people at CTU

396
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,850
and told them what he knows.

397
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,950
As soon as this nerve gas leaves U.S. soil,

398
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,450
it's gonna be very difficult to prove that 

399
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,450
either of us is connected to this in any way.

400
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,850
And you're sure that these... these... these detonators will work.

401
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,750
That the Sentox gas will be released

402
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,350
before it can be used against the Russians?

403
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,750
Yes.

404
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,480
Right now all you need to do is authorize me  

405
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,850
to terminate CTU's involvement in this matter.

406
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,850
We'll tell them we've got the situation under control

407
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,850
and that we'll deal with Bauer.

408
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,750
Who, after all, is not officially affiliated with them any longer.

409
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,850
All right.

410
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,650
Good.

411
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,950
Yes?

412
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,750
Mr. President, I have Mrs. Logan for you.

413
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,150
Not now.

414
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,750
Yes, sir.

415
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,850
Dunley.

416
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,850
What is Jack Bauer doing here?

417
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,050
Why is he under arrest

418
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,150
and why wasn't I told?

419
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,450
Orders of the President.

420
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,450
Directly?

421
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,550
No.

422
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,850
It came through Walt Cumming office.

423
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,450
Okay.

424
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,850
Thank you.

425
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,550
We're no longer running point on the search for the canisters.

426
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,350
We've been ordered off by Division.

427
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,550
Why?

428
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,150
The White House wants to use their own people to coordinate from now on.

429
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,050
That doesn't make sense,

430
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,950
we'll waste hours getting another agency up to speed.

431
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,250
I know, I tried calling the President.

432
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,350
He's not taking my calls.

433
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,150
What about Mike Novick?

434
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,250
Jack should be with him by now.

435
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,550
Novick's people say he's unreachable

436
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,850
and Jack's cell goes right to voice mail.

437
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,450
Something's wrong.

438
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,250
I know.

439
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,350
But I don't know what we can do about it.

440
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,250
I do.

441
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,550
What?

442
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,450
We can disregard the order.

443
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,250
We're not disregarding a presidential order.

444
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,550
If we don't, we will not find this nerve gas.

445
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,550
Sending Jack Bauer to have a conversation with Mike Novick as a private citizen is one thing,

446
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,050
but I'm not about to start considering disobeying a direct order from the White House.

447
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,850
That's because you don't have the experience to know any better.

448
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,650
Mr. Buchanan.

449
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,450
Will you step outside for a moment?

450
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,250
I can't have you talking to me like that in front of these people.

451
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,250
You're right, I'm sorry.

452
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,450
Are we clear about who's in charge here?

453
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,350
But my advice stands.

454
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,150
If this order jeopardizes our chances of finding that nerve gas,

455
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,150
it's your responsibility to ignore it.

456
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,750
At least until we can make our case to the White House.

457
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,650
You also need to learn to make decisions faster.

458
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,350
Bill.

459
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,750
One more thing that comes with experience.

460
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,750
Lynn.

461
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,350
If we don't do everything in our power to stop these terrorists,

462
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,850
we're not doing our job.

463
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,550
Okay, disregard the order.

464
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,850
Thank you.

465
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,450
Is there anything else you'd like me to pack for you?

466
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,850
Maybe a few of your... nicer dresses?

467
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,550
I'm being confined to a psychiatric ward, Evelyn.

468
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,450
I don't think there are gonna be any black tie events.

469
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,250
Sorry.

470
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,850
How'd this happen?

471
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,850
What's that, Mrs. Logan?

472
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,650
Charles and me.

473
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,450
I was his confidante.

474
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,050
All those years in Congress, my...

475
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,050
opinion was the one that mattered most to him.

476
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,850
And now I'm...

477
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,850
less than an afterthought.

478
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,050
I'm sure the President would be here if he could.

479
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,850
He's the President of the United States, Evelyn.

480
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,850
He can do whatever he wants.

481
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,850
If he wanted to be here, he would be.

482
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,350
Mr. Bauer, you're being moved, for the President's orders.

483
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,550
Where?

484
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,650
To a class three detention facility.

485
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,950
On what charges?

486
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,450
I was invited here by Mike Novick.

487
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,750
Those are my orders, sir.

488
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,550
You're Pierce, right?

489
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,250
Aaron Pierce.

490
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,550
You served under David Palmer.

491
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,450
Yes, I did.

492
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,350
I need to speak with you just for a moment, please.

493
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,250
That's not possible.

494
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,850
It concerns David Palmer's killer.

495
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,150
All right.

496
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,650
David Palmer was assassinated

497
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,250
because he was on the verge of discovering that the terrorists

498
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,950
that attacked us today were being helped

499
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,950
by someone within Logan's administration.

500
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,650
Who?

501
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,650
Walt Cummings.

502
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,950
Why would Mr. Cummings be involved with terrorists?

503
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,050
I couldn't tell you.

504
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,950
But I can tell you that the terrorists are now 

505
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,550
in possession of a weaponized nerve gas

506
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,550
and Walt Cummings may be the last chance we have to stop them in time.

507
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,950
Walt Cummings ordered the assassination of David Palmer.

508
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,850
I know that's hard to believe,

509
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,850
but I can prove it, it's true.

510
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,750
Actually, it's not that hard to believe.

511
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,760
The First Lady also thinks 

512
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,050
someone in the administration was involved.

513
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,290
Your primary responsibility as lead agent is 

514
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,350
to protect the President of the United States.

515
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,450
Someone in his administration is undermining his authority.

516
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,850
That is equivalent to a coup d'etat.

517
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,850
Agent Pierce, please...

518
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,550
please, I need your help.

519
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,550
Bauer's escaped.

520
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,250
When?

521
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,350
I didn't get a code alert.

522
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,650
My comm's down.

523
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,550
Call it in, have agents cover the west gate.

524
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,450
That's where he was headed.

525
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,050
What about you?

526
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,050
I'll take your post.

527
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,050
Go.

528
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,250
Yes, sir.

529
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,250
That was NSA.

530
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,150
CTU hasn't transferred the search operation to their jurisdiction yet.

531
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,950
What's the problem?

532
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,250
I don't know.

533
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,550
But you need to call Lynn McGill.

534
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,650
Make sure we're in charge of this.

535
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,750
I've been avoiding his calls

536
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,750
because he's just gonna ask me why I'm pulling CTU off the search operation

537
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,150
and I don't know what to tell him!

538
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,450
You don't have to tell him anything.

539
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,050
You're the President.

540
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,150
Agent Pierce.

541
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,850
We're in the middle of a meeting if you don't mind.

542
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,850
Mr. President.

543
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,850
My name is Jack Bauer

544
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,050
and I'm sorry to have to confront you like this,

545
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,780
but your chief of staff is withholding information 

546
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,050
that is vital to this nation's security.

547
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,450
Stop this!

548
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,850
I'm the President of the United States.

549
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,750
Get your hands off this man!

550
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,150
Agent Pierce, do something!

551
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,450
I am, Mr. President.

552
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,850
I'm upholding my oath to protect you.

553
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,850
That won't have any effect, sir.

554
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,650
I've overridden the distress line.

555
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,550
Mr. Cummings is guilty of conspiring with terrorists.

556
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,050
He facilitated the theft of a military grade nerve gas

557
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,050
and today is responsible for the death of at least three people,

558
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,350
including David Palmer.

559
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,150
I know about that,

560
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,850
but there's an explanation.

561
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,250
Do you mean, you know about that?

562
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,950
Mr. Bauer, please, I just found out a couple minutes ago.

563
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,350
It's very complicated.

564
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,950
I don't know what this man has told you,

565
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,450
but we need to find that nerve gas now

566
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,450
and I mean immediately

567
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,750
before it is too late.

568
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,050
It's already too late.

569
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,750
What do you mean?

570
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,850
Apparently, it's on its way out of the country.

571
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,150
Where is it?

572
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,450
He told me he doesn't know!

573
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,850
He's lying to you, sir!

574
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,850
The man I have inside has gone dark.

575
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,650
I don't know.

576
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,250
I'm done talking with you, you understand me?

577
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,450
Now you read my file.

578
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,250
First thing I'm going to do,

579
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,650
take out your right eye.

580
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,350
Then I'm going to move over and I'm going to take our your left

581
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,350
and then I'm going to cut you.

582
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,570
I'm going to keep cutting you until I get the information that I need,

583
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,540
you understand me?

584
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,950
So for the last time, where is the nerve gas?

585
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,850
I don't know.

586
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,950
Stop!

587
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,650
Stop! Stop! I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

588
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,650
I'll tell you.

589
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,650
It's... it's on a freighter leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

590
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,850
How is it concealed?

591
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,050
In a container carrying medical supplies.

592
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,250
What's the container number?

593
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:29,950
I don't know.

594
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,850
What's the number?

595
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,450
I don't know!

596
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,350
I... I'd tell you, I swear.

597
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,850
Mr. Bauer!

598
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,850
I don't know.

599
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,750
Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack Bauer on line three.

600
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,650
Jack, what's going on?

601
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,650
We've been trying to reach you.

602
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,350
Bill, hold on.

603
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,550
I'm going to put you on speakerphone.

604
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,850
Bill, I'm standing here with the President.

605
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,020
The nerve gas is at Long Beach Harbor 

606
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,810
in a container full of medical supplies 

607
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,350
on a freer bound for Central Asia.

608
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,550
It's set to depart at 2:30 p.m.

609
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,350
How solid is the intel, Jack?

610
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,550
It came directly from Cummings.

611
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,850
Mr. President, we've been trying to reach you

612
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,250
about an order we received changing our jurisdiction.

613
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,650
Disregard the order.

614
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,650
Then you want CTU to maintain operational control of the retrieval?

615
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,150
Yes, absolutely.

616
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,350
I'm alerting CBP.

617
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,950
Get hazmat teams in there and set up a perimeter.

618
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,250
Have medical teams standing by in case the gas is released.

619
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,650
Got it.

620
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,550
Good work, Jack.

621
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,550
Are you heading back to CTU?

622
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,150
I don't know yet.

623
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,950
Jack, we'll let you know when we have more information on the container.

624
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,550
Copy that.

625
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,830
Mr. President, Agent Pierce and I are prepared 

626
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,880
to hand ourselves over to the authorities now.

627
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,750
Aaron.

628
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,550
Yes, Mr. President?

629
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,550
Take back your shield and get Walt Cummings out of my sight.

630
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,450
Yes, sir.

631
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,650
He told me it was too late and I believed him.

632
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,750
You need to undersnd, I trusted Walt Cummings...

633
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,350
but he lied to me.

634
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,850
I was coerced.

635
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,550
There is... one more thing that we need to discuss.

636
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,950
What is that, sir?

637
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,750
You.

638
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,450
The fact that you're alive presents problems for both of us.

639
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,850
Yes, Mr. President.

640
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,850
I accomplished what I set out to do,

641
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,250
which was to identify and locate David Palmer's killer.

642
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,250
I would like to stay on until the nerve gas is retrieved.

643
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:25,550
After that, I give you my word I will simply disappear again.

644
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,850
All right.

645
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,850
I think that would be best for the good of the country.

646
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,850
Yes, sir.

647
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,650
Thank you, Mr. Bauer.

648
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,750
Thank you, Mr. President.

649
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,650
Excuse me.

650
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,650
I'll see you soon.

651
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,150
Wait, hold up, Kevin.

652
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,750
What's happening?

653
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,250
- Martha.  - Charles...

654
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,750
Come on.

655
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,850
Get out of the car.

656
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,750
Be careful.

657
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,850
What?

658
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:55,850
You were right.

659
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,350
There was a conspiracy.

660
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,450
David was trying to warn you and warn me.

661
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,350
I should have listened to you.

662
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,450
I... I...

663
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,550
you... you believe me now?

664
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,850
It was Walt Cummings.

665
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,850
He lied to me.

666
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,950
He convinced me that you were out of control.

667
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,050
Walt?

668
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,550
Sending you back to the...

669
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,550
the clinic in Vermont was his idea.

670
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,650
And you went along with it.

671
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,950
I'm sorry, Martha.

672
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,350
Sending me away without a word...

673
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,350
like I was...

674
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,350
some nuisance to be gotten rid of.

675
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,550
Excuse me, Mr. President.

676
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,950
But you wanted to know when a link with CTU was established.

677
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,850
Yes...

678
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,350
thank you, Wendy.

679
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,350
See that the First Lady's bags get back to her room.

680
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,750
Of course.

681
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,850
I've got to go.

682
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,050
Chloe, do we have confirmation on the intel Jack gave us?

683
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,050
There's only one ship scheduled to leave the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

684
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,350
It's a freighter heading for Central Asia,

685
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,650
leaving from Pier F.

686
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,050
We don't have CTU teams in the vicinity,

687
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,600
but we've got a Customs and Border Protection task force on site under our directive.

688
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,650
All right, make sure that CBP understands the nerve gas is housed

689
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,550
in 20 canisters of gray metal that are unmarked.

690
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,150
They're going out in a shipment of medical supplies.

691
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,250
Yeah, yeah, they know all that already,

692
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,750
but there's going to be about a thousand cargo containers on that ship

693
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,450
and we don't know which one the nerve gas is in.

694
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,950
It's container 539146, box seven.

695
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,750
I was able to hack into the ship's manifest.

696
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,550
It's the only container stocking medical supplies.

697
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,450
That's great.

698
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,050
Make sure all the strike force units have that.

699
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,650
Right.

700
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,950
Lynn, the White House is requesting a live feed from the assault.

701
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,550
We'll have Chloe patch them in once the TAC teams reach the staging area.

702
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,850
All right, got it.

703
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,250
That's him.

704
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,150
His name is Ivan Erwich.

705
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,150
He's a chemical engineer trained at the University of St. Petersburg.

706
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,050
Joined his country's separatist movement six years ago.

707
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,850
Do we have any clearer images, any file photos?

708
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,550
No, which is why we need you to I.D. him when the strike force has a visual.

709
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,250
Okay, just make sure that CPB knows that we need to take Erwich alive.

710
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,250
They know. Stand by.

711
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,550
What's the situation?

712
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,350
The strike team is in place, Mr. President.

713
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,650
We're just waiting for the video feed to come up.

714
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,450
Feed's up.

715
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,850
CTU, we've located the target container.

716
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,950
No hostiles present.

717
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,750
You have the green light, Agent Finn.

718
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,650
Remeber, do not discharge your weapons unless absolutely necessary.

719
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,650
If a bullet breaches one of those canisters,

720
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,450
we'll have a massive casualty situation.

721
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,750
Copy that.

722
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,750
Masks on.

723
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,850
Go!

724
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,450
Don't move!

725
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,850
Put your hands in the air now!

726
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,150
He's dead.

727
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,150
Open them up.

728
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,750
Open them up.

729
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,450
Let's go! Open them all up.

730
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,850
This one.

731
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,550
Empty. Next.

732
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,250
Moving on, moving on.

733
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,150
Come on, get it open.

734
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,750
Empty. Next.

735
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,550
Come on, move it, open it, open it.

736
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,750
Next.

737
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,750
Open it, come on, come on.

738
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,850
What do we got? What do we got?!

739
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,850
Nothing?

740
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,350
There are no gas canisters here, CTU.

741
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,850
Repeat, the nerve gas is not here.

742
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,650
Get Walt Cummings in here now!

743
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,750
Yes, sir.

744
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,750
Damn it!

745
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,250
The nerve gas isn't there.

746
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,550
It has to be.

747
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,550
Where are the canisters?

748
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,050
I don't know.

749
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,550
I... I've told you everything.

750
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,850
They have to be there.

751
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,950
Oh, god.

752
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,250
What is it?

753
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,450
That's Schaeffer, the man we had inside.

754
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,450
They must've found out we reprogrammed the detonators.

755
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,650
It's his cell phone, sir.

756
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,850
Who's calling you?

757
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,750
That's Schaeffer's number.

758
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,450
Bill?

759
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:12,950
Jack?

760
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,750
I want you to monitor and record this call.

761
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,650
We're on it.

762
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,250
Answer it now.

763
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,650
Yes?

764
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:24,650
We know you've altered the arming codes, Mr. Cummings.

765
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,950
Who is this?

766
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,550
I think you know my name

767
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,750
as I now know yours.

768
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,550
Your man Schaeffer confessed everything.

769
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,850
Is President Logan with you?

770
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,850
The President had nothing to do with this.

771
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,050
Nor did anyone else in the government.

772
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,150
I was acting alone.

773
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,850
Do you really expect me to believe that?

774
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,550
It's the truth.

775
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,850
Erwich, listen.

776
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,950
We can negotiate something.

777
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,050
I don't negotiate with my enemies.

778
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,650
I eliminate them.

779
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,650
Your country is about to pay a very steep price.

780
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


781
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,730
Has Bauer arrived at CTU?

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,060
No, not yet.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,880
I need you to clear an entrance.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,020
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer?

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,220
- What the hell's going on here, Spenser?  - I was following orders.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,460
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer, they have a reason.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,990
This man is a professional assassin.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,830
He just killed Dr. Paulson. He tried to kill me.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,450
Did you let him into CTU?

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,790
They told me he was here to place a tap on one of the servers.

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,020
That's all I knew.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,270
Who told you?

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,810
The white house.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,190
Mr. Cummings.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,870
David Palmer was murdered

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,500
because he was about to expose Walt Cummings' connection to the terrorists.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,490
You want the nerve gas? Cummings is your connection.

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,290
Cummings is the president's chief adviser.

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,030
How exactly do you suggest we get to him?

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,870
I could secretly meet with Mike Novick.

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,610
Who did you tell?

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,820
Who did you tell?

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,140
I didn't tell anybody, Jack!

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,780
Tell your men to stand down!

25
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,400
- I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that.  - Put your hands in the air!

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,960
Sentox gas is being smuggled out of the country

27
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,050
by separatists who think they're going to use it against the Russians.

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,110
However, that nerve gas will never reach Russian soil.

29
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,320
And you know this how?

30
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,380
We control the remote detonators on those gas canisters.

31
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,850
As soon as they've reached the terrorist base,

32
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,620
we'll trigger the canisters by satellite and release the gas.

33
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,420
You're a traitor.

34
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,420
You'll let things play out as they are.

35
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,890
Otherwise, your administration will be implicated,

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,980
and your presidency will be destroyed.

37
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,094
Mr. President, my name is Jack Bauer 

38
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:30,260
and I'm sorry to have to confront you like this.

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,026
But your chief of staff is withholding information 

40
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:35,180
that is vital to this nation's security.

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,170
Stop this!

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,480
I'm done talking with you. You understand me?

43
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,260
So for the last time, where is the nerve gas?

44
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,690
Stop! Stop!

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,170
I'll tell you!

46
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,400
It's on a freighter leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,670
CTU, we've located the target container.

48
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,350
No hostiles present.

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,330
You have a green light.

50
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,000
Take possession of the canister.

51
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,760
Open 'em up. Let's go.

52
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,970
Open 'em all up.

53
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,000
Empty. Next. Moving on. Moving on.

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,720
What do we got, nothing?

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,090
There are no gas canisters here, CTU.

56
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,660
The nerve gas is not here.

57
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,150
Where are the canisters?

58
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,590
I've told you everything.

59
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,470
We know you've altered the arming codes, Mr. Cummings.

60
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,910
Erwich, listen.

61
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,220
We can negotiate something.

62
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,340
I don't negotiate with my enemies.

63
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,160
I eliminate them.

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,540
Your country is about to pay a very steep price for betraying us.

65
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,650


66
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,540
I was approached six months ago by a man named James Nathanson.

67
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,500
He was my contact.

68
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,650
Who is he?

69
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,750
Former CIA.

70
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,790
Said he was recruiting like-minded individuals for this initiative.

71
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,510
"Initiative"

72
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,110
Is that what you call this?

73
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,660
You helped terrorists acquire weaponized nerve gas!

74
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,730
I told you we were gonna trigger the canisters

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,170
once the separatists reached their base in central Asia.

76
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,920
This was not supposed to happen.

77
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,040
But it happened!

78
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,400
You got into bed with these people,

79
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,300
and now they're threatening to use the gas on American citizens!

80
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,020
Oh, you make it sound like our goal was to kill Americans!

81
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,650
What the hell was your goal, Walt?

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,720
Explain that to me.

83
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,950
We're patriots, Mr. President.

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,430
We were acting in the best interests of this country.

85
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,070
How is any of this in our best interest?

86
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,020
Shoring up a strategic partner in the war on terror,

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,110
ensuring a stable flow of oil.

88
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,070
How is any of that not in our national interest?

89
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,010
I have Chloe O'Brian's on the line for Jack Bauer.

90
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,500
Chloe, are you set up for the trace?

91
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,970
All set, Jack.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,890
We're ready to call Nathanson.

93
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,310
How long do I have to keep him on the line?

94
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,490
Until I give you a signal.

95
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,060
Chloe, dial the number.

96
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,750
The line's been disconnected, Jack.

97
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,590
There's nothing to grab onto.

98
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,260
They must know something went wrong.

99
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,550
He's gone dark.

100
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,710
Damn it, Walt!

101
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,499
I don't want this weapon deployed on us soil 

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,200
any more than you do,

103
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,480
but Nathanson cannot help you now and neither can I.

104
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,700
These terrorists are operating on their own.

105
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,510
Mr. President, I think he's telling the truth.

106
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,170
He can't help us, not anymore.

107
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,000
Aaron, get him out of here.

108
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,420
Yes, sir.

109
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,940
Jack.

110
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,460
What do we do now?

111
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
I need to be debriefed.

112
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,660
After that, I'm leaving, sir.

113
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,760
Given the current situation, things have become more complicated.

114
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,730
Ctu is gonna have to be responsible for the retrieval of the canisters.

115
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,290
Why are you leaving?

116
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,400
Sir, I have a daughter that doesn't know that I'm still alive.

117
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,850
If I have to disappear again,

118
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,720
in all fairness to her,

119
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,680
I don't think she should know.

120
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,000
Jack, terrorists just threatened to deploy chemical weapons on US soil.

121
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,240
They have the ability to kill millions of people.

122
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,680
I understand that, Mr. President,

123
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,770
and I believe that CTU can handle this.

124
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,990
Jack, your experience can make a crucial difference in stopping them.

125
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,520
Look... you and I have a complicated history.

126
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,370
I realize that.

127
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,440
And I'm not naive enough to expect any special personal allegiance from you.

128
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,130
But I know your respect for this office and your concern for this country

129
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,340
is just as strong as it was when you served under David Palmer.

130
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,930
I'm asking for your help,

131
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,000
just until this crisis is over.

132
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,980
I will reinstate you.

133
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,670
I will give you all the support you need.

134
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,100
- Mr. President, you and I...  - Jack, please!

135
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,517
For god's sake, 

136
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:49,220
we need to recover this nerve gas before it's too late.

137
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,540
Micro-circuitry on this remote has been tampered with.

138
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,880
As far as I can tell,

139
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,130
unless we can repair it,

140
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,630
we can't arm the canisters.

141
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,920
Rossler will have a way.

142
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,580
He should have called by now.

143
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,550
Our real enemy is Russia.

144
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,150
We should be figuring out another way to get back home,

145
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,780
not wasting time trying to use the gas against the Americans.

146
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,290
Question my orders again, and I will kill you.

147
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,890
Do you understand?

148
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,470
They've closed the ports.

149
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,290
They will hunt us until they find us.

150
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,520
So if we cannot use the gas against Russia,

151
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,130
we will use it against America.

152
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,040
Get up.

153
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,820
Hello?

154
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,030
Lynn?

155
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,600
Jenny, now is a really bad time.

156
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,700
Yeah, I know you're busy,

157
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,820
but I need to see you, please.

158
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,560
What is it?

159
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,550
I need some help.

160
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,940
You mean money.

161
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,020
Lynn, I'm clean.

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,750
I'm working two jobs 

163
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:07,570
and busting my ass to put my life back together.

164
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,990
How much?

165
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,210
$500.

166
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,690
Can I, can I come over there?

167
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,360
Absolutely not.

168
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,810
Why?

169
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,030
Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?

170
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,940
Yeah, I am.

171
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,620
Lynn, I got nobody else to turn to.

172
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,770
You know, I can't go back on the street again.

173
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,420
If you don't help me,

174
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,470
I swear I'm going to hurt myself.

175
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,670
For god's sakes, Lynn, I'm your sister.

176
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,440
All right, listen.

177
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,640
Jenny, listen.

178
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,060
There's a parking lot across the street from CTU.

179
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,100
I'll meet you there in 20 minutes.

180
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,320
Okay.

181
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,750
Thank you, Lynn.

182
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,100
Sorry I'm late.

183
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,720
I was just explaining that

184
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,380
Cummings provided us with a schematic of one of the canisters.

185
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,840
Triggering mechanisms on the canisters can only be activated via satellite relay.

186
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,220
Cummings says the terrorists have been given invalid detonation codes.

187
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,280
Then these canisters are useless to them.

188
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,380
Unless they can find a way to control the triggering mechanism.

189
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,000
Are we running evacuation scenarios?

190
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,840
Evacuation isn't feasible,

191
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,350
not without a time frame or a target.

192
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,000
Erwich's threat was intentionally vague.

193
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,950
What are we doing to track these canisters?

194
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,890
Chloe?
Chloe?

195
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,050
I pulled a voice print from Erwich's call to Cummings

196
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,530
and I'm doing a scan of all satcom chatter.

197
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,920
If Erwich is in contact with anyone on that bandwidth,

198
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,920
we should be able to intercept and trace the call.

199
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,874
We better get lucky 'cause we just 

200
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,050
got a new assessment from civil defense.

201
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,760
They're estimating that the nerve gas from each canister

202
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,970
will create kill zones between one and three square miles.

203
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,780
The terrorists are in possession of 20 canisters.

204
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,027
We're talking about potential casualties 

205
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,880
in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps over a million.

206
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,290
Yeah?

207
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,890
Ivan Erwich?

208
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,090
Go ahead.

209
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,740
Jacob Rossler.

210
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,700
I was asked to call you by a friend in Moscow.

211
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,690
You've been briefed on our situation?

212
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,725
You need to reconfigure the remote trigger 

213
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,870
for an aatox chemical delivery system, right?

214
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,010
Yes.

215
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,840
You have the canisters with you?

216
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,050
Yes.

217
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,790
You'll need to start by cutting into them.

218
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,260
I'll give you the specifications.

219
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,880
O'Brian.

220
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,060
We just got a pattern match.

221
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,010
Send me the hit.

222
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,440
All interagency search protocols are being run through CTU.

223
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,120
Ken, no one is going around you.

224
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
All right, I'll make sure that you're apprised in real time.

225
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,000
Audrey, I thought you should know.

226
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,540
Logan has asked Jack to be reinstated on a provisional basis.

227
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,290
He's been given full autonomy and access.

228
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,850
We got a possible intercept on Erwich.

229
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
This just happened.

230
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,070
On the inner casing,

231
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,480
you will find a display window with a seven-digit readout.

232
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,290
I'll need them.

233
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,760
And then what?

234
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,230
Then I will program a new chip for your remote trigger.

235
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,800
- Put me through to Jack Bauer.  - Yes, sir.

236
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,660
Voice print is a 95% match.

237
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,530
It's Erwich.

238
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,000
He was on a sat-phone. I can't trace it,

239
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,030
but the call originated from a landline downtown.

240
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,830
I have Jack Bauer for you, sir.

241
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,500
This is Bauer.

242
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,750
Jack, we may have a lead on Erwich.

243
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,970
I'm listening.

244
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,230
We intercepted a call between Erwich and an unknown associate.

245
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,460
We weren't able to trace Erwich,

246
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,980
but we may have a location for the associate.

247
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,620
22 north Figueroa, a penthouse.

248
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,700
Chloe, bring up the building manifest. See who's in there.

249
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,700
On it.

250
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,570
From what we heard,

251
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,290
Erwich is trying to acquire some kind of activation code.

252
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,540
Yeah, he's trying to reconfigure the trigger mechanism,

253
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,780
so he can disperse the Sentox.

254
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,290
Bill, we're running out of time.

255
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,080
Okay, the penthouse is leased to a man named Jacob Rossler.

256
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,660
Cross-checking.

257
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,554
He's a software programmer indicted 

258
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:51,430
for high security code infiltration, identity theft.

259
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,540
Never convicted.

260
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,360
Okay, I'm gonna need schematics on the building 

261
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,010
and vectors for every entrance.

262
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,990
We'll have it for you by the time you get there.

263
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,600
Bill, we're going to need to go in covertly.

264
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,160
Have Curtis meet me at the location with a small team of four.

265
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,030
But tell them to stay out of sight until I get there.

266
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,740
Right.

267
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,970
We'll be in touch.

268
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,650
This is our new destination.

269
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,920
They'll clear a landing zone for you.

270
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,673
Mr. Buchanan, this building's security system 

271
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,470
uses proprietary technology.

272
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,590
It's a high-end platform.

273
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,560
It's a bitch to hack into,

274
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,220
especially with the time constraints we're under.

275
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,550
So, get Edgar to help you.

276
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,850
Spenser is better.

277
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,840
Chloe, absolutely out of the question.

278
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,660
Spenser can do this faster than Edgar and I put together.

279
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,710
He wrote an infiltration code that took us four months to hack.

280
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,720
That's a bad idea.

281
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,400
Stay out of this, Edgar.

282
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,720
He didn't know Cummings was dirty.

283
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,960
His polygraph proved that.

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,240
He was spying on us.

285
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,620
He was spying on you. He lied to you.

286
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,760
Sir, if you don't let Spenser help us do this,

287
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,360
we're not going to get it done in time.

288
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,252
He has to wear a security wristband 

289
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,040
and be under constant supervision.

290
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,080
Fine.

291
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,810
Audrey Raines.

292
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,500
Audrey, it's Jack.

293
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,270
- Hey.  - Listen, I wanted to tell you myself,

294
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,680
the president asked me to stay on until the canisters were retrieved.

295
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,100
Jack, you know what this means.

296
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,070
You'll be exposed.

297
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,090
CTU can handle the crisis.

298
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,250
Audrey, the president thinks I can help. 

299
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,780
Jack, you don't owe them this.

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,450
Listen, Audrey, the reason why I called is,

301
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,280
I need to ask you to do me a favor.

302
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,380
What?

303
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,920
Kim doesn't know I'm alive yet.

304
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,260
I don't want her to find out the wrong way.

305
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,700
Do you want me to tell her?

306
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,030
No, I just want you to call her and bring her in to CTU.

307
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,510
I'll see her when I get back.

308
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,420
All right.

309
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,640
Are you sure you're comfortable doing this for me?

310
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,310
Of course.

311
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,980
Thank you.

312
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,610
Sure.

313
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,660
Yeah.

314
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,520
Well, your swing arm needs to be replaced.

315
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,610
With parts you're looking at $475.

316
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,440
Yeah. We're open till 5:00.

317
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,800
Okeydoke.

318
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,230
Can I help you?

319
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,450
Do you have some kind of precision tool for cutting metal?

320
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,650
Sure.

321
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,370
Where is everyone else?

322
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,200
Lunch. Why?

323
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,300
I need you to do some work for us.

324
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,180
And we need it done fast.

325
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,990
If you do it, you'll live. Do you understand?

326
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,130
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,970
Just take it easy.

328
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,950
Get the canisters.

329
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,790
Why haven't I gotten an update?

330
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,550
Bauer left here on some sort of lead.

331
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,450
Find out if CTU is any closer to recovering the nerve gas.

332
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,510
Yes, sir.

333
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,360
How are you feeling?

334
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,990
Remarkably well...

335
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,720
for someone whose husband tried to have her committed 

336
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:05,220
without so much as a good-bye.

337
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,670
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,990
I didn't come here to fight with you.

339
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,400
You have every right to.

340
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,280
The two of us used to be a pretty good team.

341
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,370
Do you remember?

342
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,710
I was the one you would always come to first for advice.

343
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,910
I remember.

344
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,660
We've got to get back to that relationship, Charles.

345
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,730
You're right, things are going to get rough for you.

346
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,998
And you are going to need me 

347
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:46,520
and everything that I can give you.

348
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,290
I don't know what to say, Martha.

349
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,120
Don't you ever do that to me again.

350
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,430
Mike, please, come in.

351
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,140
Mr. President.

352
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,370
Mrs. Logan.

353
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,350
Mike.

354
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,120
Mike, I owe you a profound apology.

355
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,200
You were in an impossible situation, sir.

356
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,780
I understand why you did what you did.

357
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,900
No.

358
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,870
I panicked, Mike, that's it.

359
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,750
Plain and simple.

360
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,960
I'm not proud of how I handled myself.

361
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,430
I intend to make it right from this point on.

362
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,220
I'd like you toesume your duties.

363
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,330
Of course, sir.

364
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,910
Thank you, Mike.

365
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,270
CTU is in the process of tracking down the canisters,

366
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,450
but we still have to deal with the issue of Walt Cummings.

367
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,770
It's all right, Mike.

368
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,590
I would like Martha's input on this.

369
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,490
So what do we do about Walt?

370
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,400
We can't detain him indefinitely.

371
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,473
Maybe not, but we can keep him out of sight long enough for us 

372
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:02,500
to construct a credible narrative.

373
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,180
Mike...

374
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,030
Are you talking about a cover-up?

375
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,640
I mean, exercising discretion to spare this country unnecessary humiliation.

376
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,500
Walt Cummings was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.

377
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,450
He has allowed these terrorists to get their hands on weaponized nerve gas.

378
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,060
- That is at this point a very real and present threat.  - With respect...

379
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,130
Mrs. Logan,

380
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,330
if we go public with Cummings,

381
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,640
the president's reputation won't be the only casualty.

382
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,420
The credibility of this office will be destroyed.

383
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,680
Charles, you are going to take a hit on this.

384
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,440
But you won't be destroyed.

385
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,570
You did nothing wrong except to trust someone who betrayed you.

386
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,940
You are human.

387
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,547
You might be overestimating 

388
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:47,760
the public's capacity for forgiveness.

389
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,360
No. I'm not.

390
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,720
The only thing they won't forgive is being lied to.

391
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,160
I think you should issue a statement to the press,

392
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,470
and the sooner the better.

393
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,870
I agree.

394
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,730
Why don't you and I work on it together,

395
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,160
see what we come up with.

396
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,680
Great.

397
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,930
Chloe.

398
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,560
Go to station 3. We don't have much time.

399
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,520
Thanks for getting me restated.

400
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,960
I only did it because I need your help

401
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,730
getting Jack through the high-security building,

402
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,140
not because I forgive you because I don't.

403
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,290
Have a seat.

404
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,840
We need to gain access to the security server at 22 north Figueroa.

405
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,770
It's a proprietary network, so get to work.

406
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,460
Chloe?

407
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,240
I swear, I thought I was falling...

408
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,570
I don't care, Spencer.

409
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,800
CTU, they've got eyes and ears on building security.

410
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,870
We have two units,

411
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,730
one east, one west of the building.

412
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,300
Chloe, do you copy?

413
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,010
We're here, Jack.

414
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,290
Spenser's countervailing the building's security protocols.

415
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,610
What are you talking about?

416
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,190
Spenser's under arrest.

417
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,780
Buchanan released him from Holding.

418
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,640
Fine, just give me Rossler's position.

419
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,560
I've hacked into the building's motion sensors.

420
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,740
According to them, Rossler is still in the penthouse.

421
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,490
I have two guards on the penthouse level.

422
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,030
What about the ground level entrance?

423
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,730
There's one guard, three surveillance cameras.

424
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,120
Okay. Stand by to take out all security cameras

425
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,480
that are covering the front desk and the elevators.

426
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,090
I can only shut them down for 60 seconds.

427
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,780
After that, they will reboot automatically.

428
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,350
That's as long as you have to subdue the lobby guard.

429
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,040
Copy that.

430
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,140
Teams A and B, you will remain in a holding position till you get a "go" code.

431
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,210
We are one minutes out.

432
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,310
We have to cross the street to get to Rossler's building.

433
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,000
We're ready to cut into the canisters.

434
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,415
You have to cut precisely ten centimeters 

435
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:31,070
from the bottom of the casing to reveal the trigger.

436
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,040
How thick is the outer casing?

437
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,600
Five millimeters.

438
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,870
Call me with the identification numbers when you're done.

439
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,580
We're in position.

440
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,760
We're set. We're ready to go.

441
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,550
Just few more seconds to access control.

442
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,960
Okay.

443
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,310
Here we go, Jack.

444
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,630
On my mark.

445
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,230
Camera's dark.

446
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,320
Federal agent. Let me see your hands!

447
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,900
Let me see your hands!

448
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,430
Elevator code, let's have it.

449
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,950
Uh... four, zero, seven, three, pound.

450
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,170
Unit one, status check. Just lost cameras A and C.

451
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,180
Tell him you don't know why the cameras went down,

452
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,260
but everything is okay.

453
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,490
Everhing is okay.

454
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,090
Status check: Blue.

455
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,180
Don't know why the cameras are out.

456
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,500
Everything's fine down here.

457
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,060
Turn around.

458
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,440
Back up to me.

459
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
Where are the elevators?

460
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,970
The elevator's almost there. You have two floors to go.

461
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,280
The camera reboots in ten seconds, then you'll be visible.

462
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,340
Move! Move!

463
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,310
Unit one, status check.

464
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,670
Where are you?

465
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,100
You tell him you had to use the men's room.

466
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,670
Base, headed to the men's room.

467
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,960
Something's wrong.

468
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:32,990
Yes?

469
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,810
Mr. Rossler?

470
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,040
We may have a situation.

471
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,860
What kind of situation?

472
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,490
I'm not sure.

473
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,780
Please remain in your office until you get the all clear.

474
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,510
The guards look suspicious.

475
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,140
One of them has an automatic weapon.

476
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,470
Copy that.

477
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,440
Federal agents.

478
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,960
You okay?

479
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,580
Yeah. Go ahead.

480
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,910
Get my vest.

481
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,680
Rossler's on the move.

482
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,470
Where is he?

483
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,710
9:00.

484
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,860
Federal agents. Drop the weapon!

485
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,470
Drop the weapon!

486
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,040
Put your hands behind your head.

487
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,080
Do it!

488
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,290
Interlock your fingers.

489
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,630
Rossler is in custody.

490
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,550
I repeat: Rossler is in custody.

491
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,790
All backup teams move in.

492
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,750
I need a medic.

493
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,370
We're patching you into the situation room.

494
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,550
Someone else is in the penthouse, Jack.

495
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,570
In the bedroom, to your right. North side.

496
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,420
Curtis, cover him.

497
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,750
I got him.

498
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,030
Let me see your hands.

499
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,410
Let me see your hands!

500
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,540
Don't shoot.

501
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,560
Who are you?

502
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,190
I'm Inessa.

503
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,280
Who did that to you?

504
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,120
You are the police?

505
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,080
Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.

506
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,030
He is holding me here.

507
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,780
I want to go home.

508
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,810
You need to cut

509
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,330
into the outer casing exactly ten centimeters from the bottom.

510
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,100
The casting is five miimeters thick.

511
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,860
You cannot puncture the inner lining.

512
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,370
What's in these things?

513
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,230
Don't worry. Just do what I say.

514
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,820
Just... Can't you tell me what this is all about?

515
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,550
Do you have a family, Cal?

516
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,310
A wife.

517
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,370
My wife is in prison.

518
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,670
She's been there for seven years.

519
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,490
Her only crime

520
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,130
was to support me while I fought for my country.

521
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,820
My son lives in a state-run facility,

522
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,640
he does not even remember what I look like.

523
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,530
You want to know what this is about?

524
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,930
It's about justice.

525
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,790
It's about ending tyranny.

526
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,280
When you're finished,

527
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,700
we will leave.

528
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,020
You won't hurt me?

529
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,090
You're not my enemy.

530
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,770
Your government is my enemy.

531
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,150
Hey.

532
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,830
You have my word.

533
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,810
Begin.

534
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,790
It's all right. You're all right.

535
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,430
Just take a seat.

536
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,040
You are safe now.

537
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,720
We should get a medic have a look at her.

538
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Get information, I want CTU run a full background check.

539
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,380
I don't mind that they've dressed his wound,

540
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,490
but make sure they don't give him anything for the pain.

541
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,760
Yes, sir.

542
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,780
Curtis. Put him in a chair.

543
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,550
All right, let's go. Get him up.

544
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,250
Easy on my leg.

545
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,910
Just get him over there.

546
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,060
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm from CTU.

547
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,480
25 minutes ago you contacted a man named Ivan Erwich.

548
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,990
What did he want you to do for him?

549
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,840
I want my lawyer.

550
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,340
You'll get a lawyer as soon as I get what I need.

551
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,740
Mr. Erwich is in possession of 20 canisters of Sentox-VX nerve gas,

552
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,360
which he has threatened to deploy here in the United States.

553
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,190
I guess you have a problem.

554
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,420
No, sir. You have a problem.

555
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,400
You've been conspiring with and aiding a known terrorist,

556
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,100
which means I get to hold you for as long as I want.

557
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,498
Now, we know Mr. Erwich can't deploy the canisters 

558
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:50,720
unless he reconfigures the trigger mechanism.

559
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,560
Is that what he wanted you to do?

560
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,870
Trust me.

561
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,170
You don't want to go down this road with me.

562
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,540
Go to hell.

563
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,560
That's exactly where I'm going to send you 

564
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,880
unless you start to cooperate.

565
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,850
You like hurting girls?

566
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,000
Curtis.

567
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,140
By the time I finish with you,

568
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,470
you're gonna wish you felt this good again.

569
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,110
Where is Erwich?

570
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,040
I want full immunity.

571
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,410
Unfreezing of all my assets.

572
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,180
And transport to a foreign country of my choosing.

573
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,120
No.

574
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,290
I need Inessa.

575
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,070
She comes with me.

576
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,490
That's the deal.

577
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,000
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

578
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,800
We're not making a deal. Curtis.

579
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,030
Jack, it's Lynn.

580
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,520
Go ahead.

581
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,620
We don't have the luxury to engage in brinkmanship.

582
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,430
He's gonna tell us what we want to know.

583
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,660
You may be right, but we're not gonna wait around to find out.

584
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,640
Accept the deal.

585
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,310
That's an order.

586
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,500
Fine. It's your call.

587
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,630
We're signing off.

588
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,470
Make sure he follows through. I'll be back in a few minutes.

589
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,780
I've been instructed to accept your proposal.

590
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,850
A certified agreement,

591
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,590
signed by the Attorney General.

592
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,030
When I see that, I'll tell you what you want.

593
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,430
And remember, I want Inessa.

594
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,130
Your immunity agreement is being drawn up. Now I want something.

595
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,990
Where's Erwich?

596
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,730
I have no idea. I don't know the man.

597
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,030
Not even what he looks like.

598
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,890
I first spoke with him 30 minutes ago.

599
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,510
We were put in contact through a mutual associate in Russia.

600
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,310
Who?

601
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,880
Sergei Voronov.

602
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,270
He's a commander in the resistance movement.

603
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,720
What's Erwich want?

604
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,530
He wants to reprogram the chip of the trigger.

605
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,580
He's calling me back with the identification keys.

606
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,270
What's your time frame?

607
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,860
Within the hour.

608
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,510
How is he going to receive the package?

609
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,230
I was going to deliver it.

610
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,850
We haven't agreed on a meeting place.

611
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,470
I want that chip.

612
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,880
It's in a safe place.

613
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,590
Once I see some paperwork,

614
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,460
I'll show it to you.

615
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,340
I want you to be ready to fit that chip with a transponder 

616
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:23,770
so we can track him.

617
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,670
Okay.

618
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,030
Buchanan.

619
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,180
Bill, it's Jack.

620
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,490
Where are we with Rossler's immunity agreement?

621
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,910
We have the Attorney General's sanction.

622
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,770
You should have the documents in a few minutes.

623
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,770
Okay, good.

624
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,840
Did we get any information on the girl?

625
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,820
There isn't much. Inessa Kovalevsky.

626
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,070
Reported missing 19 months ago from Kiev.

627
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,820
The assumption is, she was kidnapped by traffickers in the sex slave trade.

628
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,190
She's 15, Jack.

629
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,040
15?

630
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,540
Okay, thanks, Bill. I'll get back to you.

631
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,900
You can't take the girl.

632
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,120
Then you don't have a deal.

633
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,741
You'll have your immunity, your freedom. 

634
00:31:24,742 --> 00:31:25,810
Leave the girl out of this.

635
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,540
No.

636
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,310
Inessa is all I care about.

637
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,160
She comes with me,

638
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,180
or you lose Erwich.

639
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,750
I've almost finished compiling those surveillance protocols.

640
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,120
Whatever you have, port it over to Edgar's station.

641
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,820
- Why?  - He'll be finishing that task.

642
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,640
Fine.

643
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,810
Chloe, don't you understand?

644
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,190
I know.

645
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,150
I'm glad you do.

646
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,650
You don't work here anymore, Spenser.

647
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,510
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

648
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,830
What?

649
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,071
Your reinstatement was temporary. 

650
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:19,190
Just until we got rossler into custody.

651
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,570
But there's still a lot of stuff that has to be done here.

652
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,230
We pulled people from division. We don't need you anymore.

653
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,890
These men will escort you out.

654
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,880
I know that was hard, but you did the right thing.

655
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,630
Shut up, Edgar.

656
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,580
You're right. We don't need that part.

657
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,040
Okay,

658
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,010
"I promise a full and open inquiry into this matter.

659
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,870
I will not rest until I've restored the faith 

660
00:33:04,871 --> 00:33:07,110
that you have placed in this office,

661
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,750
and I can demonstrate to you, the American people,

662
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,630
that I bear its mantle of responsibility

663
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,360
with respect and deep humility. "

664
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,810
See, this way, you're assuming responsibility for Walt's actions,

665
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,080
but you're also personally taking the initiative to bring him to justice.

666
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,360
Well, I'd like to run it by Mike, but

667
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,350
I think it works.

668
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,090
I think it's the right move, Charles.

669
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,130
Thank you for letting me help you.

670
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,190
I'm glad to have your help.

671
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,090
Been a long time since you and I have worked together like this.

672
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,650
Yes?

673
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,640
Mr. President. Mike.

674
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,490
What is it, Mike?

675
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,870
I think you should come here. I'm in the west hallway.

676
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,460
What's going on?

677
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,140
Just come here, sir.

678
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm on my way.

679
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,180
Good.

680
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,770
Cut him down.

681
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,310
Thanks for meeting me. You got the money?

682
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,200
Jenny, I'm not here to bring you money.

683
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,930
Here's the name of a doctor. He's a good man.

684
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,400
I want you to call him.

685
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,770
I'll pay all the expenses.

686
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:48,880
It won't cost you a cent.

687
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,370
We'll call him together.

688
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,090
I can't.

689
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,120
Don't hurt him.

690
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,930
Oh, my god.

691
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,830
Hurry up.

692
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,200
Let's go.

693
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,780
I'm so sorry. Lynn.

694
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,000
Come on!

695
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,820
Rossler's been given a shot for the pain.

696
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,890
We have air and land pursuit units on standby.

697
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,250
As soon as he moves out, we'll be ready.

698
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,310
No one's going anywhere unless Erwich makes that call.

699
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,750
Stand by the phones.

700
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,250
Excuse me.

701
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,890
Audrey Raines.

702
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,810
It's me.

703
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,690
Hey.

704
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,290
Did you manage to get a hold of Kim?

705
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,520
No. I tried her, but she wasn't in.

706
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,920
I left a message.

707
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,340
Would you mind trying again for me, please?

708
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,720
Of course.

709
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,090
Okay, thanks.

710
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,270
I want to contact my family.

711
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,300
They must be so worried about me.

712
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,440
I... I need to explain something to you first.

713
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,360
Please, sit down.

714
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,700
For now...

715
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,720
We need you to go

716
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,650
with Mr. Rossler.

717
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,490
Just... just for now.

718
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,000
Men like me,

719
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,600
agents, are going to follow you.

720
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,820
And when we get what we need from Mr. Rossler,

721
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,230
they're going to move in

722
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,550
and they're gonna take you away from him.

723
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,690
You don't know what he does to me when we're alone.

724
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,680
I promise you, I won't let him be alone with you.

725
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,190
I don't believe you.

726
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,540
I won't do it.

727
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,270
Please, let...

728
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,320
Let me go. Please.

729
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,090
I'm sorry. I can't.

730
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,830
Then you are no different than Rossler.

731
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,510
I am not Rossler.

732
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,350
Look at me.

733
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,230
I won't let anything happen to you.

734
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,160
I promise.

735
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,060
We need you to get dressed, please.

736
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,990
Thank you.

737
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,110
Good job.

738
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,950
That's it.

739
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,960
Load the canisters. Get rid of the body.

740
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,030
Pick it up.

741
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:13,750
Yes?

742
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,120
We have the identification keys. I'm messaging them to you now.

743
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,970
I've got them.

744
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,120
How long will it take you to reprogram the chip and deliver it back to us?

745
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,230
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

746
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,170
You and I need a place where we can meet.

747
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,560
You're coming personally?

748
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,510
Unless you have someone who can install and program a coded binary chip.

749
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,120
I'll call you back in five minutes with the location.

750
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,400
I'll be here.

751
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,000
Get him set up for a wire.

752
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,490
I'll get the girl.

753
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,680
Yes, sir.

754
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,680
Mr. Rossler, in a minute, we're going to be implanting a transmitter.

755
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,720
We're ready to go.

756
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,560
It's going to be fine.

757
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,570
Let's go.

758
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,230
What's happening?

759
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,880
Couldn't complete the trace. We've narrowed it down to a ten-block radius.

760
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,310
Okay. Thanks.

761
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,320
No!

762
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,160
Hold your fire!

763
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,270
Get a medic in here now!

764
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,820
Inessa, give me the gun.

765
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,230
I know you don't want to hurt anybody else.

766
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,870
Is he gonna make it?

767
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,510
No.

768
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,040
He's dead.

769
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,310
Rossler was our only link to those canisters.

770
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,260
Erwich's gonna call here any minute.

771
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,970
He's gonna expect to talk to him.

772
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,970


773
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:13,970

﻿1
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,870
You helped terrorists acquire weaponized nerve gas!

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,590
I told you we were going to trigger the canisters

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,830
once the separatists reached their base in central Asia.

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,260
Damn it, Walt, you got into bed with these people and now

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,930
they're threatening to use the gas on american citizens!

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,600
What do we do about Walt?

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,110
We keep him out of sight long enough for us to construct a credible narrative.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,420
Are you talking about a cover-up?

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,940
Walt Cummings was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,930
If we go public with Cummings,

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,220
the credibility of this office will be destroyed.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,140
- Mr. President...  - What is it, Mike?

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,400
I think you should come here.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
What's going on?

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,980
Just come here, sir.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,700
- Lynn?  - What is it?

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,640
I know you're busy, but I need to see you, please.

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,750
Hurry up!

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,700
I need you to do some work for us and I'm going to need it done fast.

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,750
Get the canisters!

21
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,080
You have to cut precisely ten centimeters from the bottom of the casing.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,200
You and I need a place where we can meet.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,660
Call you back in five minutes.

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,140
Logan has asked Jack to be reinstated on a provisional basis.

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,520
He's been given full autonomy and access.

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,910
We got a possible intercept on Erwich.

27
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,420
A man named Jacob Rossler...

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,660
a software programmer indicted for high-security code infiltration.

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,710
Never convicted.

30
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,860
Copy that.

31
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,960
Federal agents!

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,720
Rossler is in custody! I repeat, Rossler is in custody!

33
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,850
Answer.

34
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
Yes?

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,580
We have the identification.

36
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,230
No!

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,290
No!

38
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,870
Is he gonna make it?

39
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,080
No. He's dead.

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,980
Rossler's our only link to those canisters.

41
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,240
Erwich's gonna call here any minute.

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,430
He's gonna expect to talk to him.

43
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,970


44
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,840
What's the situation?

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,180
Rossler's dead,

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,000
shot by his female companion.

47
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,520
What does that do to our plan?

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,110
We intended to use Rossler to lead us to Erwich and the Sentox.

49
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,280
How?

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,690
Rossler was going to sell Erwich a chip

51
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,770
that would enable him to activate the canisters and release the Sentox.

52
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,840
And we put a tracker on the chip?

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,280
Yes, to follow Erwich back to the canisters.

54
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,580
Obviously that plan has to change.

55
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,350
Has Erwich set a time and place for the meeting yet?

56
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,230
No.

57
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,960
We've also picked up increased chatter related to the canisters.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Related how?

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,850
Erwich's been putting out feelers to terrorist organizations

60
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,630
with sleeper cells established here.

61
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,580
He's asking for help launching nerve gas attacks on larger targets, across the country.

62
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,630
There's a call coming in on Rossler's phone.

63
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,560
We assume it's Erwich. What do you want to do?

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,870
Put it on the speaker.

65
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,440
Jack, this has to be Erwich. CTU is on the line.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,990
You ready?

67
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,650
Yeah.

68
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,270
Five minutes.

69
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,840
Roof of the parking garage,

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,290
corner of White Oak and Mattison.

71
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,760
One of my men will meet you.

72
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,940
Look for a blue van.

73
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,340
What do you think?

74
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,340
I think we caught a break.

75
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,700
Give me the chip.

76
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
CTU Operation.

77
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,190
This is Jack Bauer. Let me speak to Bill Buchanan.

78
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,390
Jack Bauer is on the line.

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,690
Buchanan.

80
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,940
Bill, did you get that?

81
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,638
Yes. Erwich is sending someone else to the meeting. 

82
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,990
That's a problem.

83
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,130
No, I don't think so. It means I can pass myself off as Rossler.

84
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,450
We can keep the meeting. We can control this thing.

85
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,530
Rossler and the man Erwich is sending may know each other.

86
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,920
No, he said, look for a blue van.

87
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,620
He wouldn't have said that if they knew each other.

88
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,270
It's a big risk, Jack.

89
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,120
Jack, they will probably kill you,

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,540
even if they do think you're Rossler.

91
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,740
It ties up a loose end.

92
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,780
Well, right now, we don't have a choice.

93
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,060
If we're lucky, this guy will take the chip back to Erwich.

94
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,000
That will lead us to the nerve gas.

95
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,380
All right, Jack.

96
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,300
Do it.

97
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,420
Thank you.

98
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,370
Chloe, Edgar,

99
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,500
Jack is gonna need you to tech support him through the installation of that chip.

100
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,830
We'll pull up the schematics.

101
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,980
Already on it.

102
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,730
All right, the chip you'll be giving them is genuine,

103
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,540
but it's useless without the correct unlock code.

104
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,510
The tracker's built into the chip itself.

105
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,770
Okay. Thanks.

106
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,540
How do you want to play this?

107
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,567
Passive, nonthreatening. 

108
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,540
I want these people to think I'm scared of them.

109
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,290
All right, get tac teams ready. We're on the move.

110
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,850
You'll need a new com unit with fresh battery.

111
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,540
You'll be patched into CTU at all times.

112
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,090
With this, we'll be able to hear everything within a 20 foot radius of you.

113
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
I'll be watching your back.

114
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,470
Thanks.

115
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,490
Testing, one, two, three. Testing, one, two, three.

116
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,990
He'll be waiting for you there.

117
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,740
Let me know if there's a problem.

118
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,310
Do we have the new chip yet?

119
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,200
No.

120
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,660
I sent Polakov and Komar to meet Rossler.

121
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,570
They should have it in a few minutes.

122
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,360
Anything?

123
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,280
Remote will always be the most effective way of triggering the canisters.

124
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,040
I understand, but what if the new chip doesn't work?

125
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,720
I need options in case Rossler fails us.

126
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,490
There may be a workaround,

127
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,220
but someone will have to be on site with the canister.

128
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,630
Get it done.

129
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,170
Excuse me, Mr. President, I thought you should know,

130
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,280
Walt's body has been moved to the secret service outbuilding for the time being.

131
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,300
You realize, sir, we still need to issue a public statement about his death.

132
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,910
No statement till his wife's been notified.

133
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,110
Of course.

134
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,960
Sir, if you don't mind me saying,

135
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
I think perhaps we have an opportunity here.

136
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,770
This statement you and Mrs. Logan plan to release...

137
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,550
disclosing the fact that Walt was part of a conspiracy

138
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,000
to supply the terrorists with nerve gas,

139
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,100
and that he was involved in David Palmer's assassination...

140
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,320
What's your point, Mike?

141
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,840
I'm sorry, sir.

142
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,450
I wonder if his death might render all that moot.

143
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,790
Go on.

144
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,650
Very little will come from dragging Walt's name through the mire

145
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,830
when he's not here to answer for what he's done.

146
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,920
And it would be devastating for this country,

147
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,090
particularly, if, god forbid,

148
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,280
that nerve gas is used against us.

149
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,860
What are you suggesting?

150
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,160
We could attribute Walt's suicide to a

151
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,910
despondency over the day's events.

152
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,500
Overwork.

153
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,090
Personal issues.

154
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,630
Let him go out with some dignity, you mean,

155
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,220
and not as a traitor.

156
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,470
Yes, sir.

157
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,580
My wife will have a considerable problem with that.

158
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,020
I respect the first lady's moral conviction, but ...

159
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,860
this is your decision,

160
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,900
not hers.

161
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,130
Is there anything else I can get you, Mrs. Logan?

162
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,110
No, thank you, Evelyn. I'm fine.

163
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,690
Can I ask your advice on something?

164
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,110
Of course.

165
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,660
Some of the staff are asking questions.

166
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,910
About?

167
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,450
Walt Cummings' death.

168
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,660
Evelyn,

169
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,420
I'm helping prepare a statement right now that the president's gonna give later.

170
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,890
It'll explain everything.

171
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,900
Is there something else, Evelyn?

172
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,400
Yes.

173
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,220
What? What is it?

174
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,440
Why did he do it?

175
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,760
Why did Walt kill himself?

176
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,260
I deserve to know.

177
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,880
A violent thing happened to someone that I work with every day,

178
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,240
someone who had no visible signs of depression.

179
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,270
What if it wasn't suicide?

180
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,100
What if we're in danger?

181
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,440
I don't know what to think.

182
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,010
It was suicide.

183
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,370
How can you be so sure?

184
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,970
Evelyn, listen to me.

185
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,000
What I'm going to say to you has to stay in this room

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,860
until its made public, do you understand?

187
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,940
You do understand?

188
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,670
Even his family doesn't know the truth yet.

189
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,800
Okay.

190
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,390
Walt Cummings was a traitor.

191
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,540
What?

192
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm not going to go into any details,

193
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,784
but suffice it to say that Walt was responsible 

194
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:56,130
for some of the awful things that have happened today.

195
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,690
I can't believe that.

196
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,570
The president just found out.

197
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,810
I suppose that Walt didn't want to face the humiliation

198
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,810
of a long public trial and...

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,960
and he decided to kill himself.

200
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,100
Was he working with the terrorists?

201
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,460
Our enforcement agencies are trying to figure that out.

202
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,330
Jack's arrived at the rendezvous point.

203
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,750
Maintain your distance.

204
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,713
All right, head's up. 

205
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:41,410
We have a blue van entering the parking garage,

206
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,480
license plate, six... Quebec... four... nine... nine... five... one.

207
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,240
Repeat, six... Quebec... four... nine... nine... five... one.

208
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,110
Running the plates.

209
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,970
He's heading up the ramp towards you, Jack.

210
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,780
Couldn't get a visual on who's inside.

211
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,090
I have a hit from DMV.

212
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,300
The plates don't match the vehicle.

213
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,010
They probably stole the van and put clean plates on it.

214
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,760
Two men are getting out.

215
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,890
Show time.

216
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,260
Rossler?

217
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,650
I was told there'd only be one of you.

218
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,880
Is that a problem?

219
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,740
Yeah... I don't like surprises.

220
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,060
Relax...

221
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,640
We've got your money.

222
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,540
Let me see it.

223
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,990
When I see the chip.

224
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,500
Erwich says you have to install it.

225
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,330
Where's the remote trigger?

226
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,080
Let's go.

227
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,410
Let's go.

228
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,230
Okay, Jack,

229
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,940
you need to remove the backing.

230
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,620
Inside, there are five jumpers.

231
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,740
Toggle the one in the middle to the left.

232
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,760
Then pry out the old chip,

233
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,520
do it gently.

234
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,590
When it's out, clear your throat or something.

235
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,180
Okay, insert the new chip into the slot,

236
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,220
press the reset button under the slot.

237
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,030
Screw the back on, and you're done.

238
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,670
The trigger's been reconfigured, you can activate the canisters now.

239
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,280
You'd better hope it works.

240
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,810
You're coming with us,

241
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,380
just to make sure.

242
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,420
What are they doing?

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,390
We are on the move.

244
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,280
This isn't the deal I made with Erwich.

245
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,870
I reconfigured the trigger...

246
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,720
you're supposed to just give me the money!

247
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,910
Standing by to move in.

248
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,060
Hold on, Curtis.

249
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,180
Erwich knows who Jack is,

250
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,020
he saw him at the airport. They'll kill him.

251
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,881
By the time Jack gets close enough to be recognized, 

252
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:03,830
the tac teams will move in.

253
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,950
No, we need to move in now,

254
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,760
take the two terrorists and make them tell us where Erwich is.

255
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,590
We don't have time.

256
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,504
Erwich will know something's wrong and we'll lose him. 

257
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:11,270
This is our only shot.

258
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,340
Bill?

259
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,120
Are we letting them take Jack? I'm awaiting orders.

260
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,570
Stand down, Curtis. Take no action.

261
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,190
Reassemble the tac teams and mount a follow operation.

262
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,030
All teams stand by.

263
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,800
Lynn's right.

264
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
Whatever happens, Jack can handle it.

265
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,540
He has to.

266
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,190
Come in.

267
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,630
Excuse me, Mrs. Logan.

268
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,870
What is it?

269
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,190
Laura Campbell gave me the press release to give to you.

270
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm confused.

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,990
About what?

272
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,270
It's not what you said. They're calling Walt Cummings a hero, not a traitor.

273
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,210
I don't believe this!

274
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,470
Well?

275
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,170
Is CTU any closer?

276
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,020
They're mounting an undercover operation,

277
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,910
which they hope will lead them to the canisters.

278
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,150
Hope is not good enough.

279
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,540
We want results. You need to make that abundantly clear to them, Mike!

280
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,590
I believe they're doing everything that can be done, sir.

281
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,710
I just read the statement you issued about Walt's death.

282
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,350
"Stress due to overwork robbed this country of one of its most dedicated public servants. "

283
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,660
"His work with this administration has... "

284
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,560
You're covering everything up.

285
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,690
I'll wait outside.

286
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,030
Don't go anywhere, Mike.

287
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,910
Your fingerprints are all over this.

288
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,910
Charles, we worked on this together.

289
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,440
I thought we'd both agreed that you needed to go public about

290
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,670
Walt's involvement with everything that is going on today.

291
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,370
I know. I know you're disappointed,

292
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,910
but I think it's obvious that Walt taking his own life changes things.

293
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,500
What's obvious is that this is a pack of lies!

294
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,930
Mrs. Logan...

295
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,290
Full disclosure would have been necessary

296
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,250
to ensure Walt faced justice for what he'd done.

297
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,500
With his death making that a non-issue,

298
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,170
It was decided this course

299
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,780
was best for his family.

300
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,930
Oh... Don't.

301
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,190
You don't care about his family.

302
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,860
You decided that this was best for you.

303
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,330
- But, Charles, you are dead wrong...  - Martha, that's enough!

304
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,440
I made my decision...

305
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,880
and I am the president.

306
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,060
Which means it's your job to tell the truth...

307
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,200
even when it's ugly.

308
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,490
And if you don't, I will.

309
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,090
If you feel so strongly about telling the truth,

310
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,670
you can start with Walt's wife when she arrives.

311
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,380
Suzanne's coming here?

312
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,170
To collect her husband's body.

313
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,920
So you can be the one to tell her that the real reason

314
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,100
that Walt took the coward's way out

315
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,980
was because he disgraced himself

316
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,640
and he betrayed his country.

317
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,450
All right.

318
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,640
It'll be very painful...

319
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,770
but it's the right thing to do.

320
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,750
We're one mile behind Jack,

321
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,170
heading west on Nordhoff, just passing Sepulveda.

322
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,590
Maintain your distance.

323
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,800
We've got them on satellite. We're not going to lose them.

324
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,050
Where are we going?

325
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,160
What does it matter?

326
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,880
I have another appointment, I just want to know if I'm going to make it.

327
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,310
We're almost there.

328
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,660
How long it takes once we get there is up to you.

329
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,410
What do you mean?

330
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,560
I told you.

331
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,510
We need to make sure the remote trigger works on the canisters.

332
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,380
Oh, my god, you've got one of the canisters with you.

333
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,090
Erwich wants a field test.

334
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm not going to be within 50 miles of that thing when it goes off.

335
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,840
We have masks.

336
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,040
What's the target?

337
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,140
Curtis, are you reading this?

338
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,860
Yeah. You want me to reposition the tac team for an intercept?

339
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,020
No! Not till we have a visual on the canister.

340
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,760
If they stay on Nordhoff,

341
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,940
up ahead there's an industrial park and two retail complexes.

342
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,420
They just turned north. That's not good.

343
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,590
What is it, Chloe, what's the potential target?

344
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,180
The Sunrise Hills mall.

345
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,970
Curtis, the intended target is the Sunrise Hills mall.

346
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,570
Repeat... the intended target is the Sunrise Hills mall.

347
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,530
Uploading schematics of the mall, surrounding streets, to tac teams now.

348
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,880
All right, all teams stand by for positioning.

349
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,680
We're setting up at the second level of the parking structure.

350
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,060
This is it.

351
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,100
Curtis?

352
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,580
Do you have Jack on visual?

353
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,160
Yeah. He and the two hostiles are in the south parking lot.

354
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,740
Alpha team, take the position on the perimeter of the lot.

355
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,870
Bravo team, I want your plainclothes agents in position at the mall doors.

356
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,790
How are you going to get the canister inside?

357
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,940
Through the front door.

358
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,740
Anyone asks,

359
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,720
we're working on the air-conditioning.

360
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,070
I didn't agree to this. I'm not going in.

361
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,190
Yes, you are.

362
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,560
Jack is trying to stall for time.

363
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,850
What are we waiting for?

364
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,920
There are hundreds of video cameras in there.

365
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,820
This entire country will know what we look like in the next few hours.

366
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,220
We want your leaders to know who did this to them.

367
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,320
This is your fight.

368
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,340
The deal I made with Erwich was to sell him the chip,

369
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,320
not to get my face all over the news.

370
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,470
Erwich prefers to keep you alive, but only if you cooperate.

371
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,550
Now, hand me the jackets.

372
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,740
Jack, we're moving the tac teams in

373
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,340
to recover the canister before you go inside the mall.

374
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,560
Fine, let's get this over with.

375
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,190
I'll let you know as soon as we're in position.

376
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,510
Sending redeployment orders now.

377
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,650
Hold off on that.

378
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,130
What? Lynn?

379
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,480
We have got to stop them before they get inside.

380
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,840
If we move in now, Erwich will know that we're onto him,

381
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,830
and we won't be led to the other canisters.

382
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,970
Are you talking about letting them go through with this?

383
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,500
Sacrificing the lives of all those people?

384
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,200
We're talking about accepting the damage

385
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,350
that one canister can do,

386
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,280
versus what the other 19 can do.

387
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,180
This is insane. Bill?

388
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,580
Bill's not in charge here, I am!

389
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,380
We need to call the president.

390
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,490
Let's go.

391
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,040
I just got into the mall's internal video surveillance server.

392
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,790
We should be able to see Jack.

393
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,610
Jack, we're still waiting for the president to call.

394
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,360
I'll let you know as soon as we have him.

395
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,030
Get the security guard. Knock on the glass.

396
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,860
What are you guys doing here?

397
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,520
Servicing the HVAC units.

398
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,210
We didn't get a call about that.

399
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,200
I don't know what to tell you. We did.

400
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,490
You got paperwork?

401
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,740
Just a minute.

402
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,270
Will this work?

403
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,190
Yeah.

404
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,450
Do it.

405
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,660
Throw me the bag.

406
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,700
And your jacket.

407
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,500
Mr. Buchanan, the president is on line one.

408
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,020
- Put him through.  - Yes, sir.

409
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,160
Jack, we have the president on the line. I'm gonna patch you in.

410
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,430
Go ahead.

411
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,940
Mr. President, this is Lynn Mcgill.

412
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,740
You also have Bill Buchanan, Audrey Raines, Chloe O'Brian, and Edgar Stiles in the room.

413
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,940
Go ahead.

414
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,890
Sir, we're calling you for a decision on a critical operational matter.

415
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,000
What is it?

416
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,320
Jack Bauer is currently undercover with some of the terrorists.

417
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,650
They're expecting Jack to help them release a single canister

418
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,960
of Sentox nerve gas in the Sunrise Hills shopping mall.

419
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,350
Where they are right now.

420
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,260
Well, then arrest them. What's the problem?

421
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,710
Sir, the problem is,

422
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,370
if we don't maintain Jack's cover,

423
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,090
there's no guarantee that they'll lead us back to the other 19 canisters.

424
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Do you mean actually let them release the Sentox?

425
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,450
Are you out of your mind?

426
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,390
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan.

427
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,560
I had the same initial reaction.

428
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,580
Then I looked at our updated scenarios.

429
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,800
With the help of other terrorist organizations,

430
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,220
the remaining 19 canisters could be deployed at other,

431
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,630
more crowded public areas, such as

432
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,770
subway stations, hospitals and orts arenas, sir.

433
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,010
The loss of life could exceed hundreds of thousands of people.

434
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,140
My god.

435
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,340
Bring it over here.

436
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,210
What kind of casualties are you predicting at the mall?

437
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,020
We don't have exact numbers, but based on our video surveillance,

438
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,600
our best guess is between eight and nine hundred.

439
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,140
Sir, many of them are children.

440
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,410
Can't you evacuate the mall?

441
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,340
Not without the terrorists knowing.

442
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,300
The public will not tolerate the government's complicity in this.

443
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,950
They wouldn't know, sir.

444
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,290
This would be a covert decision.

445
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,270
We are monitoring the terrorists,

446
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,140
we know 100% certaintity

447
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,400
that they will leave the mall they're going back to the remaining canisters.

448
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,600
What's your recommendation?

449
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,400
Bill Buchanan and I agree

450
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,490
that the greatest good would be served by allowing them

451
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,040
to release this single canister of Sentox nerve gas.

452
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,840
And I believe, sir,

453
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,970
that we have no right to sanction the deaths of innocent people.

454
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,280
We should take our chances, interrogate these men,

455
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,050
and find the location of the other canisters.

456
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,780
Are we ready?

457
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,070
Almost.

458
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,070
Mr. President, we're running out of time.

459
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,580
We need your decision, sir.

460
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,780
This is a field operation. It's up to you.

461
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,220
With all due respect, Mr. President, it's not.

462
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,980
We don't have the legal authority to make this decision,

463
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,500
only you do.

464
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,120
You're putting me in a terrible position.

465
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,820
Hold on.

466
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,960
Mike?

467
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,690
CTU has laid out the facts well.

468
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,760
But you have to make the call.

469
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,470
All right.

470
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,420
The terrorists are forcing us to make a tragic choice.

471
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,960
I'll go along with your assessment.

472
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,570
Let them release the Sentox.

473
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,550
But you better find those other canisters

474
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,710
or those people will have died in vain.

475
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,930
Pull our tac teams out of the mall.

476
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,570
Jack, you heard the president's decision.

477
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,040
Let's go.

478
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,340
Put your masks on.

479
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,770
Go and arm the valve.

480
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,220
What's the unlock code?

481
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,140
Jack, the unlock code is Alpha... Kilo... Charlie.

482
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,430
I repeat, Alpha... Kilo... Charlie.

483
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,960
Come on! What's the unlock code?

484
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,960
Alpha... Kilo... Charlie.

485
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,210
Echo... Bravo... Charlie.

486
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,390
Enter the correct code, Jack. That's an order.

487
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,350
Jack, this is a direct order from the president!

488
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,900
Now enter the correct code,

489
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,330
let them release the gas! Now!

490
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,900
It's not arming the canister.

491
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,570
Why isn't it working?

492
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,380
Maybe the remote's been damaged.

493
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,500
Make it work or I'll kill you.

494
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,740
There's nothing I can do.

495
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,470
Make it work!

496
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,690
I told you there's nothing I can do!

497
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,310
Jack, can you hear me?

498
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,540
Yes?

499
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,960
We can't arm the canisters!

500
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,750
What is the problem?

501
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,230
Rossler says he doesn't know.

502
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,560
Do you believe him?

503
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,620
I don't know.

504
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,860
Should I kill him?

505
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,740
Not until we are sure we have another way to release the gas.

506
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,470
Andrei thinks he's discovered an alternative.

507
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,670
I'll put him on.

508
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,370
Get him in the other room.

509
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,580
Polakov.

510
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,320
What's going on?

511
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,810
Andrei thinks he may have another way to release the gas.

512
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:53,171
- See the circuit configuration?  - Yes, I see it.

513
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:55,504
Now move the jumper over.

514
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,130
Expose the red and yellow wire.

515
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,070
Hang on, I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

516
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,160
Are you sure the valve can't open without warning?

517
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,470
If you make a mistake, it could, so pay attention.

518
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,910
Five more splices to go.

519
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,910
Which one now?

520
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:19,498
The orange wire is next in the sequence. Exactly as before.

521
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:23,795
The white wire and the blue wire need to be connected directly through the circuit board,

522
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,754
then into the release valve.

523
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,794
Get the masks. We're almost ready.

524
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:31,590
OK. Now you're ready to proceed.

525
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:36,346
You'll see three inputs on the bottom left of the circuit board.

526
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:38,890
Three outputs on the top right.

527
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,267
They are marked input one...  

528
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,730
Lynn, there is still time to move in and stop them before they murder all those people.

529
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,340
Audrey, we have a directive from the president.

530
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,420
The president's not looking at these children whose death warrant he just signed.

531
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,370
Don't you realize how many more people could die

532
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,440
if these men don't lead us to the other 19 canisters?

533
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,410
They could.

534
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,550
That's theoretical right now.

535
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,270
Those children will die within minutes! Look at them.

536
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,180
- Look at the monitors!  - Audrey, that's enough.

537
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,300
No, it's not. Lynn, you tell me, if you were in Jack's shoes,

538
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
could you follow through with that order,

539
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,900
stand by and watch as they murder all those people?

540
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,480
This is war. There are going to be casualties.

541
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,940
And if those are orders of the president,

542
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,870
yes! I would have to.

543
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,220
I hope that's not true.

544
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,500
For your sake.

545
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,860
Got two more wires to go.

546
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,250
All right,

547
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,630
the wires are together.

548
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,330
Put your mask on.

549
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,340
The next pair you splice will open the valve.

550
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,980
Go kill Rossler.

551
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,150
Polakov...

552
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,910
Jack, can you hear me?

553
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,590
What's happening, Jack? What's your status?

554
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,230
I've managed to stop the flow of gas,

555
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,740
but some got into the ventilation system.

556
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,860
We need to evacuate the mall, now.

557
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,120
What about the terrorists?

558
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,570
One's dead, one escaped. Have Curtis and his men start looking for him.

559
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,200
Curtis, this is buchanan. Move in, now.

560
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,910
About time. Move in! Move in! All teams, move in!

561
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,150
You, up against the wall.

562
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,580
I'm a federal agent.

563
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,300
Terrorists have released a toic substance into the ventilation system.

564
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,140
You need to evacuate people now.

565
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,180
This is not a joke. This is not a robbery or a drill...

566
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,330
Do it now!

567
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,620
Alright, Uh, we have a red alert.

568
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,020
Begin evacuation procedures immediately!

569
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,720
Where is the power source for the ventilation system?

570
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,160
It's next to the food court. The control room door's right there.

571
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,820
Get everybody out now!

572
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,790
Proceed to the nearest mall exit in an orderly fashion.

573
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,270
A mall evacuation is in progress.

574
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,270
I repeat: The mall is being evacuated.

575
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,040
Everyone inside the building must proceed

576
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,590
to the nearest exit as quickly and as safely as possible.

577
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,700
Curtis, do you copy?

578
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,120
Yeah, Jack, we're closing in on the mall.

579
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,890
I'm going to try and shut down the ventilation system in the mall.

580
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,920
I do not have a visual on the hostile.

581
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,130
Make sure your men take him alive.

582
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Understood.

583
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,520
Curtis, it's Jack.

584
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,930
The Sentox that escaped has managed to stay in the food court.

585
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,180
I've got at least 11 people down.

586
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,760
I need assistance, I need assistance now!

587
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,980
Got it.

588
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,280
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

589
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,600
I want you to hold the mask when I take it off, okay?

590
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,860
All right, everyone, masks on.

591
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,870
Inject anyone who's down. Get them outside as soon as possible.

592
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,190
I need a shot of Atropine for a child under 12!

593
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,940
Curtis, give me that jacket for her head.

594
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,650
I'm losing her!

595
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,750
Come on.

596
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,130
She's responding. Her pulse is stabilizing.

597
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,010
Jack, we've secured the exits.

598
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,140
We don't have visual on the other terrorist.

599
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,040
If he got out of the mall before we locked down,

600
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,430
he may be lost.

601
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,070
He is our only remaining chance of finding Erwich.

602
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,370
Monitor the tracking device in the remote trigger.

603
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,680
The hostile that escaped still had it on him.

604
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,700
Chloe.

605
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,430
Jack's right.

606
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,410
The signal's moving away from the mall,

607
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,930
looks like he's on foot.

608
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,800
Michaels.

609
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,450
Jack and I are going after the remote trigger.

610
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,480
You're in charge here. Report directly to Bill Buchanan.

611
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,070
Yes, sir.

612
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,950
Walsh, gather your team. You're with us.

613
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,890
Don't be scared.

614
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,220
You're gonna be all right.

615
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,110
This man's going to take care of you.

616
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,470
- Yes.  - Rossler...

617
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,700
or whoever he was...

618
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,090
killed Komar and tried to stop us.

619
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,210
What are you talking about? Why?

620
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,500
I don't know!

621
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,810
I managed to activate the valve before I got away.

622
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,420
At least some of the gas was released in the mall.

623
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,670
You sure you're not being followed?

624
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,780
Yes.

625
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,390
What do you want me to do?

626
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,900
Come back here.

627
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,380
I'll be there soon.

628
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,050
He's turning left on Reese.

629
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,070
We're six blocks out.

630
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,880
Hold on, Mr. Mcgill.

631
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,600
I'll connect you to the president.

632
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,030
Yes?

633
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,190
Mr. President, I know this is no what your order stipulated.

634
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,670
That's why I thought it was important to let you know what was happening.

635
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,930
What's happening is I sent you over there to make sure CTU

636
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,100
was running smoothly in a time of crisis,

637
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,220
and you seem to be incapable doing that.

638
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,150
Sir, Bauer refused the order. There was nothing I could do.

639
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,790
No. I don't want excuses. Just do your job.

640
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,180
And if you can't do it, I'll find somebody else who can.

641
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,100
The estimates from the mall are much lower than we originally anticipated.

642
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,460
It appears the fatalities will be limited to between ten and 20 people.

643
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,120
Thank god.

644
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,500
So,

645
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,610
what are we telling the media?

646
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,670
Nothing yet.

647
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,150
CTU is maintaining a blackout on the ground there

648
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,280
until we give them direction on a cover story.

649
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,120
What about the other 19 canisters?

650
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,460
CTU has a terrorist

651
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,950
under surveillance as we speak.

652
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,530
They believe there's a good chance

653
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,610
he'll lead them to Erwich and the rest of the canisters.

654
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,770
All right, good.

655
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,750
There's something else, sir.

656
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,490
Suzanne Cummings has arrived to claim Walt's body.

657
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,410
Martha is on her way to speak with her now.

658
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,050
Thank you, Mike.

659
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,720
Suzanne.

660
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,860
Hi, honey.

661
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,380
I can't believe he's gone.

662
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,310
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,860
I'm so, so sorry.

664
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,440
I should have been with him today.

665
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,360
I wanted to be.

666
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,800
Honey, don't, don't do that. Don't blame yourself.

667
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,830
He told me...

668
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,310
You know how much we love you, honey.

669
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,330
And no matter what you need, we'll always be here for you.

670
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,710
I just don't understand. This doesn't make any sense.

671
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,220
You were with him today.

672
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,990
Why, Martha, why in the world would...

673
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,310
Walt do this?

674
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,610
Suzanne...

675
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,240
Walt...

676
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,240
loved this country.

677
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,760
And he loved you.

678
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,740
I'm sorry. I think

679
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,990
I need a moment.

680
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,200
Of course. All right.

681
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,890
He's slowing down.

682
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,590
He's stopping. Cross referencing with the street grid.

683
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,130
He's in front of 1136 east Muldauer.

684
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,090
Bill, we're going to have to hit him hard and fast,

685
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,040
to try and stop him from releasing any more Sentox from the canisters.

686
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,590
Agreed.

687
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,810
Set up a perimeter

688
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,880
and begin your approach.

689
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,670
All right, teams, we're moving in.

690
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,700
Put your gas masks on.

691
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,510
Team B, take the front entrance off the street.

692
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,950
We're taking the side. Go now. Go.

693
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,260
Yes.

694
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,430
- You were followed.  - I don't know how.

695
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,620
It doesn't matter.

696
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,610
You know what to do.

697
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,350
Yes.

698
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,740
No!

699
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,860
Hostile down! I repeat!

700
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,470
Hostile down!

701
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,660
Erwich's gone!

702
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,150
Curtis, have your men call in now.

703
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,260
Team A, Team B, report.

704
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,470
Come on, guys. What do you got?

705
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,360
Team Alpha, is no one here. We are clear.

706
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,700
Place is empty.

707
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,980
Erwich is gone. The canisters are gone. We've got nothing here!

708
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,850
Damn it!

709
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:52,850


710
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:58,850

﻿1
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,830
Jack Bauer is currently undercover with some of the terrorists.

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,860
They're expecting Jack to help them release

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,380
a single canister of Sentox nerve gas in the Sunrise Hills shopping mall.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,370
Do you mean to actually let them release the Sentox?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,990
Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,450
We are monitoring the terrorists,

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,340
we know 100% certaintity

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,060
that they will leave the mall they're going back to the remaining canisters.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,370
I'll go along with your assessment.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,770
Let them release the Sentox,

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,030
but you'd better find those other canisters or those people will have died in vain.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,680
There is still time to move in and stop them before they murder all those people.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,060
Audrey, we have a directive from the president.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,600
Do you realize how many more people could die

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,480
if these men don't lead us to the other 19 canisters?

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,030
Lynn, you tell me, if you were in Jack's shoes,

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,220
could you follow through with that order,

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,550
stand by and watch as they murder all those people?

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,110
If those are the orders of the president?

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,870
Yes, I would have to!

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,770
The trigger's been reconfigured.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,120
You can activate the canisters now.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,720
Better hope it works.

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,090
What's the unlock code?

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,970
Jack, the unlock code is Alpha... Kilo... Charlie.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,190
Ecko... Bravo... Charlie.

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,190
Jack, this is a direct order from the president.

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,140
Now enter the correct code and let them release the gas.

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,960
Now!

30
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,840
Make it work!

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,070
I told you there's nothing I can do!

32
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,340
We have another way to release the gas.

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,480
I managed to stop the flow of gas,

34
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,120
but some got into the ventilation system.

35
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,980
We need to evacuate the mall now.

36
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,070
What about the terrorists?

37
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,840
One's dead, one escaped.

38
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,250
Monitor the tracking device in the remote trigger.

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,490
The hostile that escaped still had it on him.

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,110
I managed to activate the valve before I got away.

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,330
At least some of the gas was released into the mall.

42
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,140
What do you want me to do?

43
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,620
Come back here.

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,350
You were followed.

45
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,870
You know what to do.

46
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,090
No!

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,230
Hostile down!

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,260
Erwich is gone, the canisters are gone.

49
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,950
We've got nothing here.

50
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,340
Damn it!

51
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,320


52
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,540
Despite an attempt by extremists to derail the process,

53
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,000
the treaty was signed earlier today by president Logan and Russian president Yuri Suvarov.

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,830
Officials from each country are hailing the agreement

55
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,120
as a major milestone in U.S.-Russian relations.

56
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,690
The white house press secretary has called this a critical achievement in diplomacy

57
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,160
and will set the course for president Logan...

58
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,480
Sentox gas is genuine.

59
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,450
The test was successful.

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,100
I spent a year securing a weapon that would bring Moscow to its knees.

61
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,330
And you waste it killing a handful of American civilians.

62
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,940
We were betrayed, Bierko.

63
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,940
Someone must pay.

64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,290
I agree.

65
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,450
You were the one who trusted the Americans.

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,040
Nathanson lied to us.

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,780
He plotted to turn the gas against us.

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,090
Your trust nearly cost us everything.

69
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,250
Since I anticipated this,

70
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,070
I have secured additional men and resources at great personal expense.

71
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,590
Have you found a way to reconfigure the canisters with dispersal mechanisms?

72
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,430
Yes.

73
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,470
Do it.

74
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,880
Nathanson will be eliminated.

75
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,810
Then we will return to our original task...

76
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,920
striking at the heart of Russia.

77
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,560
Where's Nathanson?

78
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,210
I don't know where he went.

79
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,570
I swear, I don't.

80
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,300
Yeah.

81
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,720
I took out Nathanson's men.

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,220
But there is no sign of Nathanson.

83
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,710
Find him.

84
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,570
Alpha-seven.

85
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,950
This is Nathanson.

86
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,620
Someone just took out my men.

87
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,430
Who?

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,420
I think Bierko's hitting us back.

89
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,060
Destroy all your databases.

90
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,780
I know you're there, Jenny. Pick up the phone.

91
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,970
Damn it, Jenny, I need the keycard from my wallet!

92
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,070
Look, I'll leave the police out of this.

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,380
You and your loser boyfriend can keep the money you stole,

94
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,310
max out my credit cards, I don't care.

95
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,500
Just give me back my keycard.

96
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,140
It's important.

97
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,600
We can't sell the keycard.

98
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,790
Why can't we just give it to him?

99
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,950
I'm calling my brother.

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,770
No, you're not.

101
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,440
What is going on, Dwayne?

102
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,520
I'm handling this.

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,220
Jenny?

104
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,360
Please hold for the president.

105
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,940
Have your people recovered the nerve gas?

106
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,280
Mcgill?

107
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,710
Yes, sir. I'm here. I'm sorry.

108
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,920
Do you have any leads?

109
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,390
Have you intercepted the terrorists?

110
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,290
No, sir.

111
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,593
The man we followed from the mall 

112
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:49,430
took his own life before he could be apprehended.

113
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,600
Damn it, Mcgill, I put this on you.

114
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,550
If you'd let the terrorists release the Sentox gas in the mall

115
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,060
as I agreed to let you do,

116
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,130
we wouldn't be where we are right now,

117
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,040
which is nowhere.

118
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,710
Mr. President...

119
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,030
Stop!

120
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,130
Stop making excuses.

121
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,760
Take responsibility and do your job.

122
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,430
Although we were able to limit the casualties,

123
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,560
the attack at the mall indicates that these terrorists intend

124
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,810
to make good on their threat to release the nerve gas on U.S. Soil.

125
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,280
Unless we catch a break,

126
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,920
we can expect to suffer multiple attacks,

127
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,250
resulting in mass casualties.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,010
I assumed you'd want me to start without you.

129
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,130
Just tell me where we are.

130
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,420
LAPD is setting up a perimeter around the terrorists' last known location.

131
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,100
We've activated all search protocols,

132
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,530
including satellite and caltrans surveillance.

133
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,150
But we don't have any real leads, do we?

134
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,880
If Jack Bauer would have followed orders and maintained his cover,

135
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,150
we could have intercepted these people.

136
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,920
We don't know that for sure, Lynn.

137
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,840
What we do know is,

138
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,110
Jack's field decision saved over 800 innocent people.

139
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,120
It may well cost us 100 times that many people.

140
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,250
In the meantime, we've contained both the physical threat and the media's awareness,

141
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,270
which would have triggered massive civil unrest.

142
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,980
Well, you tell yourself that if you want to, Ms. Raines,

143
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,380
but the fact remains that these terrorists are at large

144
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,490
with 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas,

145
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,570
and we don't know where or when they're gonna hit us next.

146
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,760
We're all aware of the threat, Lynn.

147
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,300
Then why does she keep defending Bauer?

148
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,720
I want Bauer placed in custody.

149
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,840
I want him brought in here.

150
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,730
I want him held responsible for what's happened.

151
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,020
Jack can be disciplined later.

152
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,230
Taking him out of the field right now is a mistake.

153
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,520
Don't tell me how to do my job.

154
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,260
He was authorized by the president, Lynn.

155
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,840
But he works for me, and so do you.

156
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,950
I want him here now.

157
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,610
The rest of you, maintain your search protocols.

158
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,190
Send your progress reports to my screen in ten minutes.

159
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,530
It's all right.

160
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,010
We're all under a lot of pressure.

161
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,610
Let's get back to it.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,710
Manning.

163
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,750
This is Buchanan. We have orders to bring Jack in.

164
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,080
We weren't able to find anything that confirmed this guy's identity.

165
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,560
I want you to take his picture, lift his prints,

166
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,650
get him over to CTU as soon as possible.

167
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,550
We've got nothing on this guy.

168
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,970
We're gonna have to run him through NCIC and interpol databases.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,070
I just got off the phone with Bill.

170
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,820
Lynn Mcgill wants me to bring you back to CTU.

171
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,980
He's on some kind of warpath.

172
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,560
Why? Because I didn't think letting terrorists release Sentox nerve gas in a crowded mall

173
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,970
was an acceptable loss?

174
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,380
And because we lost our only real lead,

175
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,150
and Lynn's looking for someone to blame.

176
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,230
I was appointed by the president of the United States.

177
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,420
It was a field call.

178
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,440
I know. And between you and me,

179
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,390
I think you made the right call back at the mall.

180
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,400
I'm calling the president.

181
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,040
Look, Jack, the trail's gone cold.

182
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,910
There's no point in fighting it.

183
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,200
Let's just go back to CTU and square it.

184
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,500
Fine.

185
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,250
Look, I'm sorry,

186
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,880
but I also have to take your gun.

187
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,840
Jack, don't make this any more difficult than it already is.

188
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,030
Fine.

189
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,210
We can't afford to decommission Jack, especially now.

190
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,110
I agree.

191
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,370
What can we do about it?

192
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,670
Nothing...

193
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,270
while Lynn's in charge.

194
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,350
He may be in charge, Bill, but he is not in control.

195
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,770
Ms. Raines, you have a call on line one.

196
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,280
I'll be filtering intel at station three.

197
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,410
Audrey Raines.

198
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,230
Ms. Raines, if you try to trace this call

199
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,560
or put anyone else on the line,

200
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,100
I will hang up.

201
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,560
Who is this?

202
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,560
My name is James Nathanson.

203
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,750
I'm sure Walt Cummings has already told you all about me.

204
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,860
You're the one who sold the nerve gas to the terrorists.

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,600
That's close enough to the truth.

206
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,180
What do you want?

207
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,970
Transfer me to Jack Bauer on a clean line.

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Why Jack?

209
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,700
That's not your concern.

210
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,960
You're getting to Jack through me.

211
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,240
That makes it my concern.

212
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,450
I'm going through you

213
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,460
because I know you have a special relationship with Bauer.

214
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,770
I know all about you, Ms. Raines.

215
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,018
Which is why I'm counting on you to recognize 

216
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,630
an opportunity when it presents itself.

217
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,820
What opportunity?

218
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,370
I can help you find this nerve gas.

219
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,580
How do I know you're telling the truth?

220
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,530
You don't.

221
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,420
Now put me through to Bauer.

222
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,480
This is Bauer.

223
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,570
Jack, I know you're with Curtis,

224
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,030
so I'm assuming that you can't speak freely.

225
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,990
It's Audrey.

226
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,280
It's personal.

227
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,630
Go ahead.

228
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,850
Thanks.

229
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,240
I'm on the phone with a man who claims to be James Nathanson.

230
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,990
He was Walt Cummings' contact.

231
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,480
He says he has information about the terrorists,

232
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,170
but he will only talk to you.

233
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,780
Why me?

234
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,440
You can hang up now, Ms. Raines.

235
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,340
My phone has a node monitor.

236
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,120
I'll know if anyone else comes on this line.

237
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,400
Jack?

238
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,710
That's all right, Audrey. Hang up the phone.

239
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,700
All right.

240
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,620
What do you want with me?

241
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,800
Protection.

242
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,360
The terrorists you're after are trying to kill me.

243
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,180
If the terrorists figured out

244
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,359
that you were the one who rigged the canisters of Sentox 

245
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,340
to blow up in their faces,

246
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,120
what do you need me for?

247
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,180
Just turn yourself in to the authorities. They'll protect you.

248
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,440
Walt Cummings isn't the only one behind this operation

249
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,820
who works inside the government.

250
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,110
I need your help.

251
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,140
You conspired to have me take the fall for president Palmer's assassination.

252
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,380
What makes you think I'm not going to kill you myself?

253
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,620
Because you want to stop the Sentox gas from being released on American soil.

254
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,100
So do I.

255
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,450
Where are you?

256
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,410
There's a phone booth on the south side of Moorpark,

257
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,130
just east of Densmore.

258
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,460
Be there in ten minutes, or I'll be gone.

259
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,390
Moorpark and Densmore. Got it.

260
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,750
Jack?

261
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,320
Audrey, I'll explain everything as soon as I get back to CTU.

262
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,360
Thanks.

263
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,250
It's going to be strange for her.

264
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,100
Audrey. Just yesterday, she thought you were dead.

265
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,580
Yeah.

266
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,720
I know it's none of my business,

267
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,530
but she's a good person, Jack.

268
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,040
I hope you two get half a chance.

269
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,530
Thanks.

270
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,460
Jack!

271
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,880
Don't fight, Curtis.

272
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,490
Don't fight it.

273
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,990
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,730
Lynn Mcgill.

275
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,440
It's Curtis. Jack escaped.

276
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,470
What?

277
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,880
He got a call from someone.

278
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,450
The next thing I know, he blindsided me, took my car.

279
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,430
Who called him?

280
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,650
He said it was Audrey,

281
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,610
but he may have been lying.

282
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,170
Lynn?

283
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,810
We can try to track him using your vehicle's onboard transceiver.

284
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,100
I just tried bringing it up on my PDA.

285
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,630
He's either disabled or shut down the transceiver.

286
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,910
Curtis, how could you let this happen?

287
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,320
I'll get dispatch on it.

288
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,340
One of my team's on route to pick me up.

289
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,520
We'll find him.

290
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,060
You don't even know where to look.

291
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,460
Get back to CTU. We'll deploy from here.

292
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,630
Damn it.

293
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,650
Chloe, run a triangulation on Jack Bauer's cell phone.

294
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,420
Find out where he is.

295
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,780
Yes, sir.

296
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,410
Have you talked to Jack since he's been in custody?

297
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,920
No.

298
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,670
Well, he's not in custody anymore.

299
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,990
He assaulted Curtis and stole his car.

300
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,540
Why would he do that?

301
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,940
Maybe you can tell me.

302
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,090
I don't know where Jack is,

303
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,980
if that's what you're asking me.

304
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,070
You have no idea what he's doing?

305
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,640
No, but I'm sure there's an explanation.

306
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,340
Mr. Mcgill, we're not getting a signal from Jack's cell.

307
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,910
The Sim card must be out of his phone.

308
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,190
Well, if you think of anything you'll let me know, right?

309
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,410
Of course.

310
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,400
Thanks.

311
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,240
O'Brian.

312
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,270
Chloe, what I'm about to tell you needs to stay between us.

313
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,900
It involves Jack.

314
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,390
What is going on?

315
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,560
It just came on my screen that Jack's gone missing.

316
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,520
He's following a lead on the Sentox gas.

317
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,620
He needed to go alone.

318
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,500
I just transferred a call from my station to him.

319
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,090
I need you to delete the record.

320
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,700
If Lynn finds out we're working behind his back...

321
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,950
Chloe, I know. Believe me, I know.

322
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,440
But this is the only way.

323
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,440
There isn't a lot of time.

324
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,180
When did you make the call?

325
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,670
Communications archive.

326
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,670
This is Lynn Mcgill.

327
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,530
Bring up the phone logs at the station Audrey Raines is using.

328
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,660
Yes, sir.

329
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,460
I found the transfer.

330
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
I can't dump just the one call.

331
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,930
They're all cross-indexed.

332
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,110
Can't you unlink it?

333
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,250
No. It would take like two hours.

334
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,470
Okay, Mr. Mcgill, the call logs should be on your screen.

335
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,280
Scroll through to station five.

336
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,060
That's the one we dedicated to the DOD.

337
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,533
The only way to get rid of the entry is 

338
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:58,380
to dump the entire log...

339
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,490
all the calls you've made and received today.

340
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,540
Do it.

341
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,650
It's done.

342
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,310
Thank you, Chloe.

343
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,320
... A day that will long be remembered as a step forward for both The United States and Russia.

344
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,140
President Logan and President Suvarov

345
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,250
are expected shortly to deliver their closing remarks.

346
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,560
Following this, the Russian head of...

347
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,170
What is it now, Mike?

348
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,020
I'm sorry, sir, but there's a call you need to take.

349
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,950
It just came in on this.

350
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,250
And what is that?

351
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,220
Walt Cummings' phone, sir.

352
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,860
It's been in Secret Service custody.

353
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,690
They just brought it to me.

354
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,310
The caller's claiming he has the Sentox gas.

355
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,450
Is someone tracing the call?

356
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,540
They can't.

357
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,540
It's being sent through multiple relays.

358
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,190
I'm not talking to a terrorist.

359
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,320
You talk to them. You find out what he wants.

360
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,000
Mr. President, he's demanding to speak with you.

361
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,400
All right.

362
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,980
But put him on speaker.

363
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,950
This is president Logan.

364
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,130
Is this Erwich?

365
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,580
Ivan Erwich is no longer with us, Mr. President.

366
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,050
His attack on your shopping mall was unsanctioned and unwarranted.

367
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,140
It didn't serve our interests.

368
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,340
What is it you want?

369
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,360
What I want is to release the Sentox nerve gas on Moscow.

370
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,990
Since that is now impossible,

371
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,560
I'm forced to strike at Russia on foreign soil...

372
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,500
with your help.

373
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,670
My help?

374
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,690
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.

375
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,300
His entire route to the airport,

376
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,190
along with a full profile of his security detail.

377
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,260
I... I don't personally have that information.

378
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,190
Then get it.

379
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,320
Make no mistake, Mr. President,

380
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,110
it's our Russian oppressors I mean to hurt,

381
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,410
not your people.

382
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,350
However, if you refuse to cooperate,

383
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,380
I will have no choice

384
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:36,000
but to release all of the Sentox gas in areas far more populated than your shopping mall.

385
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,460
You just said that killing Americans didn't serve your interests.

386
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,320
This...

387
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,190
this would be senseless murder.

388
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,860
Yes, it would.

389
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,060
So give me Suvarov's route.

390
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,220
I'll need some time.

391
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,970
You have 15 minutes.

392
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,150
I'm... I'm not sure...

393
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,590
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

394
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,080
We can't let that happen.

395
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,740
If the Russian president is killed on U.S. Soil,

396
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,400
it wouldn't just nullify the treaty...

397
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,340
it would destroy our relationship with Moscow.

398
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,550
Get me suvarov's route from Secret Service.

399
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,350
Mr. President...

400
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,550
No, I haven't made any decision yet, Mike,

401
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,920
but whatever I decide,

402
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,520
I'd better have the route in hand when he calls back, don't you think?

403
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,430
Yes, Sir.

404
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,060
Somebody's screwing with me, Bill.

405
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,730
I won't tolerate it.

406
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,230
Screwing with you how?

407
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,570
Audrey Raines' phone log has been erased.

408
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,880
What?

409
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,850
Take a look.

410
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,350
Probably a system glitch.

411
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,320
It wasn't a glitch.

412
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,850
She did it on purpose.

413
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Audrey? You think Audrey did this?

414
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,550
I know she did.

415
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,670
That's ridiculous.

416
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,780
She's one of the most by the book people I know.

417
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,180
Well, you don't go by the book when you're trying to hide something.

418
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,260
Did you know that she was on the phone with Jack right before he attacked Curtis?

419
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,160
No, I didn't know that.

420
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,360
What... what does that prove?

421
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,920
There's something going on with these two.

422
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,130
What's their history?

423
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,190
You know their history, Lynn.

424
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,460
They worked together at DOD.

425
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,210
There's more than that, right?

426
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,490
It got personal later on, Lynn.

427
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,590
Personal?

428
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,040
And you didn't think it was important to tell me that?

429
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,900
No, I didn't.

430
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,680
What difference does that make?

431
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,950
When did she find out Jack was still alive?

432
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,740
This morning, with the rest of us.

433
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,140
You sure about that?

434
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,800
I was there, Lynn. I saw her reaction.

435
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,330
Could have been an act.

436
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,690
You're starting to sound paranoid.

437
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,940
I don't care how I sound.

438
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,100
From this point on, I want all our people on a tight leash.

439
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,090
If someone has a hidden agenda,

440
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,540
I want to know about it.

441
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,110
CTU's become way too porous,

442
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,530
and that's your fault, Bill.

443
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,620
I don't need to hear this from you.

444
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,610
You don't want to hear this from me?

445
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,900
Then tell me why Audrey erased her phone logs.

446
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,970
Slow down, damn it!

447
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,080
I'm here. Where are you?

448
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,370
In a minute.

449
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,310
First, I want to make sure that you weren't followed.

450
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,170
Otherwise, there's no deal.

451
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,710
Take the alley between the two buildings across the street from you.

452
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,290
I left the gate open.

453
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,360
Listen to me.

454
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,030
I don't know what you think I can do for you, but you committed treason.

455
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,820
I don't see it that way.

456
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,610
I love this country.

457
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,520
You're never going to be able to justify killing David Palmer.

458
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,090
That was an unfortunate necessity.

459
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,600
We admired Palmer,

460
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,650
but we had other priorities.

461
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,880
This country needs a reason to secure its oil interests in Asia,

462
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,190
a reason that Russia and the rest of the world can get behind.

463
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,360
I've heard your reasoning from Walt Cummings. It's still treason.

464
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,880
No. It's realpolitik.

465
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,520
- Do you see the open door ahead?  - Yeah.

466
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,270
Enter it,

467
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,460
make two right turns, and walk back the direction you came from.

468
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Hold on.

469
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,700
You have hostiles coming in after you

470
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,140
from the adjacent parking structure.

471
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,160
- Do you have a weapon?  - Yes.

472
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,890
- Where are you?  - Second floor.

473
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,050
Try and make your way to the roof. I'll meet you there. Stay on the line.

474
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,110
All right.

475
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,080
All right. I understand.

476
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,030
Audrey.

477
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,880
DOD wants a fuller explanation about what happened at the mall.

478
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,260
I told them we're still trying to 

479
00:23:04,261 --> 00:23:05,520
find a thread on the nerve gas.

480
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,190
I just spent the last five minutes getting grilled by Lynn.

481
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,270
- About what?  - You and Jack.

482
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,950
Your relationship.

483
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,410
What'd you tell him?

484
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,510
The truth.

485
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,550
That you and he were once romantically involved and now I'm not sure.

486
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,390
I don't see how that's any of his business.

487
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,450
I thinks it is.

488
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,810
He thinks you had something to do with Jack breaking from custody.

489
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,510
Did you?

490
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,360
Not exactly.

491
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,640
What the hell does that mean?

492
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,630
A man claiming to be James Nathanson called here about 20 minutes ago.

493
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,890
He said that he had information on terrorists.

494
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,740
That he would only give it to Jack.

495
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,500
Why didn't you tell me about this?

496
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,917
I was afraid of losing this lead. 

497
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:47,210
I didn't know what to do, Bill.

498
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,830
So Jack's meeting this man Nathanson alone, without backup. Where is he?

499
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,910
I don't know. Nathanson dropped me from the call.

500
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,080
- Who else knows about this?  - Just Chloe.

501
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,450
- She helped me cover the call from Lynn.  - Audrey.

502
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,300
If you could just, uh, sign right here.

503
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,560
District elevated the threat level.

504
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,330
I'm briefing first responders on the high probability of multiple attacks,

505
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,360
so I need to review DOD protocols.

506
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,380
All right, I'll send them to your screen.

507
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,910
We can do it here.

508
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,930
Unless you have a problem working with me on this.

509
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,400
No. No, no, it's fine.

510
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,370
Excuse me.

511
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,400
Bauer?

512
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,710
Yeah, where are you?

513
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,230
I'm in the freight elevator.

514
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,580
You need to get out of there now. You're cornered.

515
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,260
Bauer, where are you?

516
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,300
I'm almost there. Just keep moving.

517
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,120
Nathanson, stay down!

518
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,530
Stay down!

519
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,440
Nathanson!

520
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,330
Look at me. Look at me.

521
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,270
How do I find the canisters of Sentox?

522
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,160
How do I find the canisters?

523
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,700
In my pocket.

524
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,120
What's on the chip?

525
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,000
Please. What's on the chip?

526
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,580
Nathanson's dead, but there was someone else there.

527
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,480
- Who?  - I don't know yet.

528
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,430
But he took out three of my men and disabled the helicopter.

529
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,100
Nathanson may have given him information that compromises us.

530
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,760
Keep looking until you find him.

531
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,410


532
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,090
Some critics have already said that by signing this treaty,

533
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,690
we as The United States are taking on our ally's enemies

534
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,950
as well as having to deal with our own.

535
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,990
Diagram seven lays out the hierarchy for first responders.

536
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,740
Civil Defense protocols for each agency are pretty well defined.

537
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,080
Shouldn't you get that?

538
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,370
Audrey Raines. 

539
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,360
It's me. Nathanson's just been killed, but he gave me intel.

540
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,930
I need you to uplink the data.

541
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,060
Sorry, Steve, you have the wrong extension. I'll transfer you to I.T.

542
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,310
Overlapping responsibilities default to federal, then to state.

543
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,430
O'Brian.

544
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,880
Chloe, it's Jack. Audrey just rolled my call over to you. What the hell's going on over there?

545
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,480
It's Lynn. He's been shadowing her.

546
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,610
He thinks that she's been talking to you behind his back, which I guess she has.

547
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,370
Chloe, listen to me.

548
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,720
I have a thumb drive that's gonna help us find the Sentox.

549
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,520
I need you to data mine the files.

550
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,030
Upload the drive to my socket.

551
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,420
Access code 5J55J.

552
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,430
Hold on.

553
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,720
You should be getting it now.

554
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,300
Chloe, I need you to keep this under the radar.

555
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,090
You mean keep it from Lynn.

556
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,970
At least until we know what we've got.

557
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,990
- My number come up on your screen?  - Yeah.

558
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,880
Okay, I had to switch out phones.

559
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,090
If you need to get ahold of me, call me back on that number.

560
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,230
Okay, I will.

561
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,100
Suvarov's motorcade, with his security detail.

562
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,940
Sir...

563
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,250
If President Suvarov is killed,

564
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,290
and the Russians find out we supplied his killers with this information,

565
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,020
it would be considered an act of war.

566
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,130
The Russian motorcade has a significant security force.

567
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,920
I see no reason to believe that the terrorists would even be successful.

568
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,080
Maybe we should have an analysis done, determine, uh, uh,

569
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,670
the vulnerable points along the route.

570
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,770
Sir, we can't do that without giving away the fact

571
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,630
that we had advance knowledge of an attack.

572
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,110
What attack?

573
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,140
It's... it's nothing that

574
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,020
you need to be concerned about.

575
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,330
Charles, you invited me into this circle.

576
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,980
What attack?

577
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,220
The terrorists want the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

578
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,200
They've threatened to deploy more Sentox gas

579
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,000
if I don't give it to them.

580
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,920
You're not...

581
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,590
seriously considering it, are you?

582
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,790
Martha...

583
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,670
Charles believes an assault on the Suvarovs has a good chance...

584
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,700
Mike, will you please let the president speak for himself?

585
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,270
May we have a moment?

586
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,080
- Charles.  - Martha, please.

587
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,390
If I don't give them the information they want,

588
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,200
tens of thousands of americans will die on our own soil...

589
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,370
maybe hundreds of thousands... and I will be responsible.

590
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,770
All right, all right, all right, Charles, Charles,

591
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,780
there has got to be another way.

592
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,320
You change their itinerary, delay Suvarov from leaving.

593
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,680
It's all over the news that the Russians are leaving after we make the joint statement.

594
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,820
If there's any deviation from that, the terrorists will know that I've alerted them.

595
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,950
Charles, what are, what are you saying?

596
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,030
That we are going to stand in front of the entire world with the Suvarovs,

597
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,870
you're going to look him in the eye,

598
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,130
shake his hand, knowing you're sending them to their deaths?

599
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,110
If we were in Russia and Suvarov got this ultimatum, do you think that he would spare us?

600
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,720
I am not talking about Russia.

601
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,720
I am not talking about Suvarov. I am talking about you.

602
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,800
You are the president of the United States of America.

603
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,780
My god! Charles!

604
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,950
You're talking about murder!

605
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,200
Martha, my back is up against the wall. You...

606
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,370
Give me another solution.

607
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,070
You stand up to them.

608
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,190
Refuse to negotiate with them.

609
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,450
Isn't that the policy of this country?

610
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,310
Isn't that the point of the treaty you've just signed?

611
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,610
It's not that simple, Martha.

612
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,870
It never is.

613
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,090
Oh, damn it.

614
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,730
Buchanan.

615
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,930
This is Chloe.

616
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,060
What is it, Chloe?

617
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,860
Jack just sent me the data he got from Nathanson.

618
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,510
My decryption filters weren't working and I just realized why.

619
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,630
The drive's DOD formatted.

620
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,410
- DOD?  - Yeah.

621
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,960
I don't know how Nathanson got his hands on a highly classified government T-drive.

622
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,900
Audrey's the only one with clearance.

623
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,150
Lynn's got her tied up.

624
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,250
Exactly.

625
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,050
How much time do you need?

626
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,220
- To decrypt all the vectors?  - Two, three minutes.

627
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,420
Hang on.

628
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,920
Lynn, do you have a minute?

629
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,440
What is it?

630
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,750
You were inquiring about a security breach with the phone logs.

631
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
That's right.

632
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,990
I had Felson run a diagnostic to see if he could trace the terminal that dumped the logs.

633
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,440
He tagged a station inside the archive room.

634
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,230
The archive room? Are you sure?

635
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,930
We can key in the user I.D. from your office

636
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:06,030
and find who we're looking for. We just have to use your key card.

637
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,900
Why are you so interested in this?

638
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,570
I'm serious about all breaches of security.

639
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,140
What was that?

640
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,770
- What?  - That last window you closed... What was it?

641
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,670
It was just the DOD protocols.

642
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,730
What is going on here?

643
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,220
Lynn, will you please just calm down?

644
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,370
Don't tell me to calm down!

645
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,190
The two of you are up to something and I'm not gonna stand for it.

646
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,820
I think you're protecting Audrey and she's protecting Bauer.

647
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,940
- Look, I can explain, Lynn.  - So can I.

648
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,150
This was a deliberate attempt to circumvent my authority.

649
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,430
Lynn, we are all on the same side.

650
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,020
If your father wasn't the Secretary of Defense,

651
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,040
I'd have you thrown out of here.

652
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,880
I don't have that problem with you.

653
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,360
Can I have security to station five, please, right away.

654
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,610
What are you doing, Lynn?

655
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,190
Place Mr. Buchanan in custody and take him to Holding.

656
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,360
You are making a mistake.

657
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,590
Audrey.

658
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,180
I want everyone's attention.

659
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,420
I'm putting a section two-three redundancy into effect as of this moment.

660
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,550
All of your stations will be mirrored and monitored through my office.

661
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,570
Now get back to work.

662
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,700
We need Bill to get through this crisis.

663
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,330
You are jeopardizing our chances of finding that nerve gas.

664
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,410
I will make sure that DOD and the Secretary of Defense are aware of that.

665
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,930
Don't threaten me. Ms. Raines.

666
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,180
I promise you, you do not want to threaten me.

667
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,430
What do you got?

668
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,830
The decryption element kicked out a company called Terra-Dyne.

669
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,200
Over the past three years, they've acquired more than 100 pounds of raw strontium isotope,

670
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,500
used to create Sentox nerve gas.

671
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,640
- Where do I find Terra-Dyne?  - La canada.

672
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,330
It's a subsidiary of a larger corporation called Omicron International.

673
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,800
Hold on, did you say Omicron?

674
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,150
- Yeah.  - Are you sure?

675
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,210
What's wrong?

676
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,960
Pull up their senior executive roster.

677
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,040
See if a man named Christopher Henderson's on the list.

678
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,300
- Why?  - Just do it, please.

679
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,770
Okay, here it is.

680
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,580
Christopher Henderson, senior vice president of research and development.

681
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,780
Do you know him?

682
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,620
Yeah, I did once.

683
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,700
Listen, send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.

684
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,280
It's gonna be a little bit hard to do right now, Jack.

685
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,040
Lynn is watching everyone like a hawk.

686
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,140
Well, can Buchanan help you?

687
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,760
He could if he weren't in Holding.

688
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,960
What are you talking about?

689
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,080
Lynn detained him for insubordination.

690
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,150
How could he do that?

691
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,470
Because he's losing it.

692
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,647
I think the president's putting too much pressure on him 

693
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:39,290
to get those canisters. He can't handle it.

694
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,910
Chloe, I still need the decrypted files.

695
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,890
You're gonna have to find a way to get them to me.

696
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,050
I'll try.

697
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,090
- They haven't called yet?  - Not yet, sir.

698
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,990
President Suvarov's waiting.

699
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,750
We'll be out in a minute.

700
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,260
Excuse me.

701
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,600
Martha...

702
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,850
please?

703
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,300
This is a difficult decision for me...

704
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,200
both politically and personally.

705
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,970
And maybe I won't have to make it.

706
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,710
Maybe CTU will find the canisters before the Suvarovs have to leave.

707
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,710
That's what I'm praying for.

708
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,880
But whatever happens,

709
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,450
I need you to understand.

710
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,680
I do.

711
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,420
I understand, Charles, I do.

712
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,360
Mr. President.

713
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,560
It has been a challenging day,

714
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,620
so I especially appreciate how professional you have all been.

715
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,730
Your president is fortunate to have such talented people working for him.

716
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,200
Thank you.

717
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,740
Yuri.

718
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,010
Anya.

719
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,220
Mr. President, I'm glad we have this opportunity to

720
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,140
thank you and Mrs. Logan personally for your hospitality.

721
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,580
Mr. President, it's been our pleasure.

722
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,690
Anya and I hope that you will visit us soon...

723
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,070
Yeah.

724
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,170
Hold on.

725
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,170
We would love that.

726
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,560
Wouldn't we, Martha?

727
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,920
Yes.

728
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,480
It would be lovely.

729
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,540
Martha...

730
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,840
thank you again for being so kind.

731
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,750
I read the text of your statement. It was excellent.

732
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,230
And congratulations again on your brilliant handling of the crisis at the airport.

733
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,920
Thank you, Yuri.

734
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,930
And... and thank you for your steadfast support.

735
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,690
Have there been further developments?

736
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,790
No, no, not at all.

737
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,410
There's always pressure, huh?

738
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,620
But everything's under control.

739
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,410
Ladies, the photographers are waiting.

740
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,070
Thank you, Mr. President.

741
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,330
The motorcade will take service roads to the 118,

742
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,940
then to the 5 freeway...

743
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,300
- Charles...  - Martha, please, just...

744
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,070
just smile and wave.

745
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,510
The motorcade will take Suvarov through this downtown corridor.

746
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,710
That will give us our best shot at destroying all the vehicles.

747
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,870
Tell our people

748
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,180
this is where I want them to strike.

749
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,020
All right, that's it, folks. We need to move.

750
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,230
Come on.

751
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,510
Charles,

752
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,190
you can't let them get in that car.

753
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,370
It's not too late.

754
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,270
Mr. President, Lynn Mcgill is calling from CTU.

755
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,620
What about?

756
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,500
He didn't say. He just asked to speak with you directly.

757
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,780
Excuse me.

758
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,490
Mr. President, I'm afraid I have to say my good-byes here.

759
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,010
Affairs of state, you know, the pressure's continuous.

760
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,990
Yes, I understand, of course.

761
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,790
Thank you, President Logan,

762
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,310
for everything.

763
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,060
Thank you.

764
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,340
Anya.

765
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,100
Charles.

766
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,190
- Mrs. Logan.  - Aaron.

767
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,400
I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovs.

768
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,710
You could have a car follow us.

769
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,600
We're not detailed for that.

770
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,830
I'll ride up front.

771
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,910
No, Aaron, no, that's not necessary.

772
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,540
Yes, it is.

773
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,580
Thank you.

774
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,780
Would you...

775
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,670
tell my husband where I am?

776
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,330
I hope you don't mind if I accompany you.

777
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,030
You sure your husband won't mind?

778
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,550
No, of course not.

779
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,170
This way, we'll have more time to talk.

780
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,660
I like this.

781
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,490
Ma'am, the president is being briefed by CTU right now.

782
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,430
But I left word for you.

783
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,690
Thank you.

784
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:13,690


785
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:26,690

﻿1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,870
I'm on the phone with a man who claims to be James Nathanson. He was Cummings' contact.

2
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,470
He says he has information about the terrorists, but he will only talk to you.

3
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,060
- What do you want with me?  - Protection. The terrorists are trying to kill me.

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,810
What makes you think I'm not gonna kill you myself?

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,090
Because you want to stop the Sentox gas being released on American soil. So do I.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,670
Nathanson, stay down!

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,390
Stay down!

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,250
What's on the chip? Please! What's on the chip?

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,090
O'Brian.

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,560
I have a ThumbDrive that's gonna help us find the Sentox.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,890
The decryption only kicked out a company called Omicron International.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,290
Pull up their senior executive roster. See if a man named Christopher Henderson is on the list.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,130
Ok, here it is. Senior vice president of research and development.

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,330
- Send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.  - That's gonna be hard to do right now, Jack.

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,700
The two of you are up to something. I'm not gonna stand for it.

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,010
- This was a deliberate attempt to circumvent me.  - Lynn. We are on the same side.

17
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,740
If your father wasn't Secretary of Defense, I'd have you thrown out of here.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,850
I don't have that problem with you.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,910
I spent a year securing a weapon that would bring Moscow to its knees

20
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,230
and you waste it.

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,000
We were betrayed, Bierko. Someone must pay.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,950
I agree.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,810
This is President Logan. What is it you want?

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,150
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,090
If you refuse to cooperate, I will have no choice but to release all the Sentox nerve gas.

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,290
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,570
Don't negotiate with them. Isn't that the point of the treaty you've just signed?

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,390
Mr. President, I'm glad that we have this opportunity

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,350
to thank you and Mrs. Logan for your hospitality.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,170
The motorcade will take service roads to the 118.

31
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,650
- Mrs. Logan.  - Aaron. I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovs.

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,000
- I'll ride up front.  - No, that's not necessary.

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,060
Yes, it is.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,250
The world has become, quote, "safer and more secure from terrorist attack".

35
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,230
President Suvarov and his wife will be flying back to Moscow in just a few hours.

36
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,710
- Yes.  - Where is the motorcade now?

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,750
- Getting on the 118.  - How long before they reach the ambush point?

38
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,910
- About 40 minutes.  - Good. We'll be waiting.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,630
Get everything ready.

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,700
Mr. President, I asked Secret Service

41
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,120
to send their threat assessment for President Suvarov's route.

42
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,110
The most vulnerable point is here at the downtown corridor.

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,990
This is the most likely point of attack

44
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,130
if an ambush were to occur.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,320
It's going to happen, Mike.

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,950
We gave the terrorists Suvarov's route.

47
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,850
I need to come up with a public response to convince the world that Suvarov's death

48
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,550
only underscores the importance of this antiterrorism treaty that we just signed.

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,210
I'll begin working on a statement, sir.

50
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,270
Yes.

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,960
Thank you. I'll let the president know.

52
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,470
What? What is it, Mike? What's going on?

53
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,490
Who was that?

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,890
Agent Pierce.

55
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,350
- I don't know how to tell you this, sir.  - Just tell me.

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,530
- Mrs. Logan is riding with the Suvarovs.  - What are you talking about?

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
Sir, she got into their limousine.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,990
Oh, my God!

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,070
Didn't the Secret Service try to stop her?

60
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,150
There was no reason to stop. The motorcade is under Secret Service escort.

61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,360
As far as they're concerned, she's not in any danger.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,150
She wants me to call back the motorcade. She's trying to save them.

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,710
- Should I alert them?  - Yes!

64
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,440
No, stop. Wait.

65
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,030
If we warn them, the terrorists are going to set off the gas.

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Where are they now?

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,880
They're still on the 118.

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,520
Get my wife on the phone.

69
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,560
My aunt visited Los Angeles in the 1950s.

70
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,080
She told me this area was filled with orange groves, but I haven't seen any.

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,730
I suppose it's all been built over, no?

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,930
Martha?

73
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,810
Yes, I was just trying to remember. I think your aunt's memory is better than mine.

74
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,330
I visited when I was a child, but I don't recall the orange groves.

75
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,690
- Yeah, this is Pierce.  - Let me speak to my wife.

76
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,610
Mrs. Logan, it's the president for you on line one.

77
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,690
Thank you, Aaron.

78
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,890
- Hello, Charles.  - Listen to me carefully. I want you...

79
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,780
Yes, they had a wonderful visit.

80
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,610
Anya would very much like us to come to Moscow. Wouldn't that be lovely?

81
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,660
I want you to tell the Suvarovs that I need you back here.

82
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,050
- I'll have one of the cars bring you back.  - I don't think so.

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,630
Tell them now, while I'm on the phone.

84
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,110
Martha, I know that you want me to call the motorcade back,

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,690
but the terrorists were very specific.

86
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,250
If I don't allow them to attack the motorcade,

87
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,860
they'll release canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations.

88
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,650
I guess we'll just have to figure something out before that happens.

89
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,620
We're trying!

90
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,140
We're trying, but we haven't found them yet. You need to get out of the car.

91
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,610
OK, I should go now, but call me if there's any change of plans.

92
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,170
- Dammit, Martha!  - OK, bye-bye. I'll talk to you soon.

93
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,290
- She won't get out of the limousine.  - My God!

94
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,890
We gotta do something. We gotta her out of the car.

95
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,340
I could have one of the trail cars stop and force her out, say that I need her back here.

96
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,570
You could, but if Martha is desperate to save the Suvarovs,

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,860
she might feel that the only remaining option is to tell them the truth.

98
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,890
Then Suvarov would know that I gave him up for assassination.

99
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,690
Sir, do you want me to recall the motorcade or not?

100
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,200
Edgar. Meet me in the server room in a few minutes.

101
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,360
- Am I in trouble?  - No, there's something very important we need to discuss.

102
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,570
- OK.  - And, Edgar?

103
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,880
Don't tell anyone where you're going. This needs to stay between us.

104
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,960
Sure.

105
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,400
- What did Audrey Raines want?  - She was just going over some DOD protocols.

106
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,800
- I thought you were monitoring chatter.  - We are.

107
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,040
- Why isn't it on my screen, Carrie?  - I didn't think you wanted us to mirror everything to your system. I thought you wanted to save time.

108
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,330
I do want to save time. It saves me time by not having to clean up more mistakes.

109
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,920
Mirror everything until we've secured this nerve gas. Clear?

110
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,570
Yes, sir.

111
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,030
The ThumbDrive data Jack sent checks out as authentic. It's time stamped by DOD and CIA.

112
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,100
So Omicron International did make Sentox gas for the military.

113
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,740
Yeah, and some terrorists found out about it. Or worse, they were in contact with Omicron.

114
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,200
- Who is this Henderson?  - Christopher Henderson, senior vice president of R & D.

115
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,510
Jack said he knew him. But he wouldn't talk about it.

116
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,320
- Is he connected with the Sentox?  - It just said he was a senior VP.

117
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,330
All right.

118
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,170
- Yeah.  - Jack, we've authenticated the data.

119
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,300
Omicron made the Sentox for the military.

120
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,300
OK. I'm almost there. I need you to work something up that gets me in without them knowing I'm CTU.

121
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,200
Do you think it's necessary to go in covertly?

122
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,700
Yeah. There's someone I need to talk to and I don't want to see me coming.

123
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,760
Christopher Henderson?

124
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,310
- Yeah.  - Who is he?

125
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,270
- Someone I used to work for.  - Where?

126
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,130
- CTU. He was the man who recruited me.  - You've never mentioned him.

127
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,770
I know. Things ended badly between us.

128
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,730
What happened?

129
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,340
I was part of an investigation that implicated him

130
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,770
in the sale of classified intelligence to defence contractors.

131
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,710
We never had enough evidence to indict him, but he lost his job, his command.

132
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,880
Even as he was walking out the door, he maintained his innocence.

133
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,470
He never forgave me for being part of the investigation.

134
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,210
- Are you convinced he did it?  - I was at the time.

135
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,920
Chloe can't find a connection between the Sentox and him.

136
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,590
Trust me, if Omicron was making Sentox legally or illegally, Henderson knew about it.

137
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,460
- Get back to me when you've got my cover.  - All right, I'm on it.

138
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,520
- What are you doing here, Chloe?  - Same thing you are doing.

139
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,950
- Thank you for coming.  - Look, whatever this is about, I don't have a lot of time.

140
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,280
We don't have a single lead on this nerve gas.

141
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,160
- That's not actually true. Jack is following a lead on the field.  - How do you know?

142
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,830
- I just spoke with him.  - Everyone is looking for him. Lynn issued an arrest warrant.

143
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,200
That's why we wanted to talk to you. Lynn is losing it.

144
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,450
First hee went after Jack, then he took Buchanan out of play.

145
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,920
- Lynn is incapable of leading us through this crisis.  - So you're both working behind his back?

146
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,080
We're afraid if we bring him in, he might derail the only good lead we have.

147
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,910
We have to help Jack locate the nerve gas before it's too late.

148
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,910
- What do you want from me?  - Cover for Chloe until Jack reports back.

149
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,250
- Please?  - OK.

150
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,470
Thank you.

151
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,310
OK, fine. Yeah.

152
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,360
That was Secret Service. As you can see, the motorcade continues to the airport without incident.

153
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,230
There won't be any warning. When these people attack, they will be fast and merciless.

154
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,280
You can count on that. I have to talk to this man.

155
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,200
- Maybe I can convince him to hold off.  - Hold off?

156
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,400
Just until Martha gets out of the car. She wasn't supposed to be part of this in the first place.

157
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,030
- I don't think that would change his plans.  - He has to know that my wife's in the car.

158
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,310
- I can't lose her, Mike.  - The only way to keep Martha safe

159
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,480
is for me to call Secret Service and tell them to turn the motorcade around.

160
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,730
What about... What about CTU? Do they have any active leads on the nerve gas?

161
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,070
As of five minutes ago, they don't. Nothing that would help.

162
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,240
What am I missing? There's gotta be some way out that I'm not seeing.

163
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,800
You're not missing anything.

164
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,860
Any action we take to save Martha would also save the Suvarovs,

165
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,990
and if that happens, the terrorists will release the gas.

166
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,390
Unfortunately, it's that simple.

167
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,560
Then there's nothing more we can do, Mike.

168
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,320
Unless I warn them...

169
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,120
Martha's going to die with the Suvarovs.

170
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,700
Aaron, have there been any changes?

171
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,220
Excuse me? Changes to what, Mrs. Logan?

172
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,500
I was wondering if there'd been changes to our route.

173
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,060
We haven't gotten any revised instructions, ma'am.

174
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,700
Thank you.

175
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,770
- Are you sure you're all right, Martha?  - Yes, yes.

176
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,300
I just wanted to make sure we don't run into any heavy traffic.

177
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,550
Understood. Those protocols should be coming over shortly.

178
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,680
- Who were you on the phone with?  - Homeland Security.

179
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,720
I gave you orders to have all systems mirrored to mine.

180
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,550
- I've been doing that.  - But you're not finished, yet somehow you have time to chat with Homeland Security.

181
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,870
They needed us to give them updated code sets. It'll just take a minute.

182
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,950
No, it won't. Stiles, finish her task. Carrie, you're done.

183
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,990
- What do you mean, "done"?  - Fired. You don't work here any more.

184
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,280
- It's not her fault. She...  - Edgar, one more word, you walk with her.

185
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,720
What's it gonna be?

186
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,350
- Where's Agent O'Brian?  - She had to step away for a minute.

187
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,160
- Where?  - I don't know.

188
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,400
OK, I'm through the gate. I'm pulling into a parking space now.

189
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,000
- How's my cover?  - I'm still trying to get your credentials into Omicron's system..

190
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,600
- You can't get in without them.  - What's the problem?

191
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,760
Omicron's systems don't refresh enough. We need to push this page in manually.

192
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,470
OK, I'm in. You're going in under the name of John Barrie, B-a-r-r-i-e.

193
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,790
- You're with a company called Eclipse LLC.  - John Barrie, Eclipse LLC. I got it.

194
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,590
- Hold on. She hasn't planted it yet.  - Chloe, what are you doing in here?

195
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,460
- I asked her to help me.  - She doesn't work for you Ms. Raines, she works for me.

196
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,070
But I don't, and DOD has assignment priority over CTU.

197
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,300
We're in the middle of a real time of an investigation and we're understaff.

198
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,800
Chloe's a department head. You can't just take her away from me.

199
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm not. We needed a system patch on the server. Chloe's the only one who could fix it.

200
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,400
Then you come and you ask me. Everything in this office runs through me.

201
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,050
Lynn, we are all trying to do the same thing.

202
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,500
- Can we please just get past this?  - Yeah, I'm past it. I want Chloe back.

203
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,110
OK, I'm finished here. Sorry, Mr. McGill. It won't happen again.

204
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,270
Good afternoon. I'm John Barrie with Eclipse. I've got a 4:30 with R & D.

205
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,710
Thumbprint, please.

206
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,470
- Go on in.  - Thank you.

207
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,750
Well, I'll tell you what to do. You kick the Macavoy meeting to next week on Thursday, but keep everything else. 

208
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,020
- What about your trip to Washington?  - That's right, OK.

209
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,940
Well, I gotta talk to Kagen tomorrow. I'll get back to you.

210
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,410
- Can I help you, sir?  - Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm a little lost. I was looking for the men's room.

211
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,700
Over there. Second door.

212
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
Thank you.

213
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,050
Audrey Raines. 

214
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,380
I need you to lose a secretary. Her name is Joanna Tandy.

215
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,140
All right. I'll take care of it.

216
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,330
- Christopher Henderson's office.  - Ms. Tandy?

217
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,650
- Yes.  - Jane Espenson from accounting.

218
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,330
We need you to double check some of these invoices.

219
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,780
- What invoices?  - It's difficult to explain over the phone. 

220
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,050
Would you mind popping down for a minute?

221
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,780
- Fine.  - Thank you. 

222
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,700
There's a problem in accounting. I'll be right back.

223
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,690
Yeah, OK.

224
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,690
Jack. Jack.

225
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,380
Just for the record, I never believed you were dead.

226
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,410
What are you doing here?

227
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,700
Earlier this morning, terrorists gained control of a large quantity of Sentox nerve gas.

228
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,090
Omicron manufactured it. I pulled up the executive list, you were on it.

229
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,330
Sure my name's on it, I work here. Omicron had the contract. We manufactured the stuff.

230
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,520
But every single gram of it went to the DOD. It's all accounted for.

231
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:19,200
That can't be true. We have confirmation the terrorists are in control of 19 canisters of Sentox.

232
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,210
Are you accusing me now Jack, of being in bed with terrorists?

233
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,110
- I'm following the leads.  - But the leads are wrong.

234
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,490
DOD destroyed the entire stockpile.

235
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:32,730
Sentox was responsible for the death of the people in the Sunrise Hills Mall less than two hours ago.

236
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,930
- The news said it was chlorine gas.  - That was a story to stop widespread panic.

237
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,890
Come on, Christopher. You know how this works.

238
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:50,850
The terrorists have threatened to release the rest of the gas.

239
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,330
Good God.

240
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,570
Whoever's implicating me in this knows my history with CTU.

241
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,490
I mean, I'm an easy target. This is not a coincidence.

242
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,720
Look, Jack. I know the deal between us, but I swear to you, I've got nothing to do with this.

243
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,600
- I can't afford to take your word on this.  - You'll have to take my word.

244
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,490
11 people died in the mall. Hundreds of thousands of others will if they release the Sentox.

245
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,610
You're not hearing me, Jack. I had nothing to do with this.

246
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,690
Then prove it to me.

247
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,090
I need complete access to Omicron's Sentox programme.

248
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,200
I'm doing it now. The entire operation was run from a bunker across the campus.

249
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,690
Let me see the bunker.

250
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,330
Let's go.

251
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,630
Chatter analysis came in. They decoded some words and phrases.

252
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,710
- What were they saying?  - It's too scrambled to make a completely sentences.

253
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,790
But number strings keep coming up ... 5, 110, 10.

254
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,310
- Freeways?  - The routes Suvarov's taking to the airport.

255
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,590
The only other phrase I could decode refers to the downtown corridor.

256
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,950
How long ago did this chatter start?

257
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,430
About 30 minutes ago.

258
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,750
Come on.

259
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,390
- Have we expanded the search?  - I've got CTU air surveillance east of Glendale.

260
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,980
- What about the North?  - Edwards Air Force Base is giving support.

261
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,500
We're still at a dead end on finding new leads of nerve gas.

262
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,630
Excuse me, Mr. McGill, there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade.

263
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,020
- What?  - Edgar just monitored some chatter from NSA and ran a threat assessment.

264
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,940
Why are you doing analysing chatter that isn't related to funding the nerve gas?

265
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,100
- It came through on one of my filters.  - The point is we found something.

266
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,980
Don't you want to alert Secret Service? He is on his way to the airport.

267
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,870
Based on an unsubstantiated theory from two analysts?

268
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,510
I've been embarrassed enough for one day.

269
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,740
Can we at least devote some resources to try to confirm this?

270
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear.

271
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,620
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear. No. Now go downstairs and focus on what you're supposed to be doing.

272
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,410
I don't think it would be a bad idea to pass along the intel.

273
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,890
Well, I do. I don't want to hear another word about it.

274
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,690
- Yes.  - Our men are in place. How far out are they?

275
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,290
They will be there in less than 20 minutes.

276
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,690
Are you sure no one's gonna interfere?

277
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,090
I don't think so. Logan knows the consequences if that happens.

278
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,730
But be alert. Make sure they haven't placed any of their people near you.

279
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,410
- If police show up, we'll deal with them.  - Good.

280
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,450
I'll call you when it's over.

281
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,850
Let's go. Let's go.

282
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,110
Keep them armed. If things don't go as planned, I'll use them here.

283
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,950
- I'm busy Ms. Rains.  - Lynn, I just looked at this chatter report.

284
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,240
I definitely think that we need to let Secret Service know of the threat.

285
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,790
I'm not gonna repeat my orders to every person.

286
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,080
My people are not gonna chase that white elephant. They're trying to locate 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas.

287
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,360
Has it occurred to you that if this is real,

288
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,960
then it's likely the terrorists who have the Sentox are the ones planning this attack?

289
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,320
This is an unverified threat. If you want to hand it off to NSA, be my guest.

290
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,800
NSA can't recall the motorcade without a time-consuming approval process.

291
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,330
Good! That process helps eliminate false threats.

292
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,850
- Look, we don't have that time.  - Ms. Raines! Ms. Raines.

293
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,240
This office has made enough mistakes and I intend to stop it.

294
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:52,640
Now let my people focus on their work or I will have you escorted out of here.

295
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,050
Thank you.

296
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,860
I need to call Secret Service but they won't act on this unless Lynn verifies it.

297
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,180
- He's never gonna back you up on this.  - Yes, he is.

298
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,860
I need you to hack into Lynn's account. I'll forge a message to Secret Service look like it came from him.

299
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,460
- That's illegal.  - Fine.

300
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,420
Edgar, I need you to put a blanket on my subnet to make it look like I'm doing something else.

301
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,500
- We could all end up in jail.  - Think about it for a second.

302
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,500
You think about it for a second. The Russian president, his wife, about 35 Secret Service, all dead in a few minutes.

303
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,220
All right. For the record, this is not a good idea.

304
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:20,300
All right. I'll compose the message. As soon as you have the forged verification, call me.

305
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,700
Curtis, excuse me.

306
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,140
We need to talk.

307
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,980
- What is it?  - We've got a problem with Lynn.

308
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,060
Yeah, he's not listening to anybody.

309
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,300
- It's gonna costing lives.  - Give him time. He'll come around.

310
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,580
Curtis, we don't have time. We've got to get Bill back here.

311
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,310
- That's not gonna happen.  - We need to make it happen.

312
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,620
What are you suggesting?

313
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,230
- Section 112.  - On what grounds?

314
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,900
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.

315
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,940
I may not agree with his choices, but going from there to mentally unfit, that's a stretch.

316
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,670
No, it's not, and you know it. You've seen him.

317
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,940
With Bill in custody, you are the ranking agent. You're the only one that can invoke it.

318
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,340
- Look, I don't know, Audrey.  - Yes, you do.

319
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:28,320
Curtis, CTU is barely functional. You are the one that can turn it around.

320
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,150
Even if I agreed, section 112 requires documentation, testimony, groundwork.

321
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,470
The record of what is going on right now is documentation enough.

322
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,820
Curtis, please.

323
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,060
Think about it.

324
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,840
- I will.  - Good. Thank you.

325
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,170
Mr. President.

326
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,970
Come in, Mike.

327
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,380
The motorcade is only 15 minutes away from the airport.

328
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,970
Yeah.

329
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,810
My father always told me that life was about problem solving, that every problem had a solution.

330
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,500
You tell me where the solution is on this one.

331
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,920
I don't have an answer, Mr. President.

332
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:08,050
But if you want the Suvarov motorcade to turn back,

333
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,930
I need to do it now.

334
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,930
We know the terrorists are willing to kill civilians. And the low...

335
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:31,090
the low end of the casualty range on this one is 100,000 lives.

336
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,730
Yes, sir.

337
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:43,220
I decided before that I couldn't risk all those lives to save one man, the Russian president.

338
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,390
I can't risk those lives now.

339
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,700
Even to save my own wife.

340
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,020
Damn you, Martha.

341
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,700
Putting me in this position.

342
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,180
You brought it on yourself.

343
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,710
Mike.

344
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,380
Pray with me, Mike.

345
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,550
Mr. President, with all due respect,

346
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,430
this is a personal matter.

347
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,990
- I don't...  - Please, Mike.

348
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,270
- How much longer until we can send this out?  - A couple minutes. I'm almost hacked in.

349
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,910
- We don't have a couple minutes.  - I'm almost there.

350
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,120
- Oh, no! Lynn cut us off.  - What do I do?

351
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,080
I think it's too late to do anything.

352
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,100
Mr. Stiles. Did you think I wouldn't notice you accessing my comm?

353
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,580
- Lynn. Listen. We need to talk.  - Shut up. These people working against CTU, that means working against me.

354
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,340
- Lynn. What is this?  - We were warning Secret Service of an attack on Suvarov's motorcade.

355
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,150
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles and Ms. O'Brian. Put'em in Holding.

356
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,030
And then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.

357
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,580
I can't do that.

358
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,600
Yes, you can. It's a direct order. Do it.

359
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,650
You forced them to work covertly. I have no choice. You're not behaving rationally, Lynn.

360
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,250
You and you, take them all into custody, including Mr. Manning.

361
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,930
If you try to carry that out, I will draw my weapon.

362
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,400
- If he draws his weapon, shoot him.  - This is out of control. Don't make it worse.

363
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,210
Why are you hesitating? I gave you an order. Now do it!

364
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,040
- What should I do, Mr. Manning?  - What?

365
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,010
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you of your command under the incapacity clause of section 112.

366
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,730
- You will do no such thing.  - Take him away.

367
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,930
You can't do that.

368
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,960
He can't do this. Don't touch me.

369
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:24,610
This is an unjustified usurpation of authority. You hear me? We're in the middle of a crisis.

370
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:30,640
There are gonna be repercussions. Everyone involved with this is gonna face prosecution.

371
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,690
- Security office.  - This is Curtis Manning. Release Bill Buchanan.

372
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,850
Inform Division he's been reinstated as director of CTU under section 112.

373
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,570
Right away, sir. 

374
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,930
Everyone, get back to your stations.

375
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,090
Fill me in.

376
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,410
Chloe and Edgar detected chatter indicating an attack on Suvarov's motorcade.

377
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,610
- How'd they get the route?  - We don't know.

378
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,770
The likely point of intercept is downtown.

379
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,250
- Is Secret Service notified?  - Lynn refused.

380
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,410
- Notify Secret Service now.  - I need to override the firewall Lynn put up.

381
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,410
- Here.  - I need Carrie. He fired her for no reason.

382
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,300
Have security reinstate her. Edgar.

383
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,340
Pull up satellite on all possible intercept points and call the president.

384
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,050
- Where are we on the location of the gas?  - No substantial progress.

385
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,810
- What about the lead Jack was following?  - He traced the gas to Omicron International.

386
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,540
- Is that where Jack is now?  - Yes.

387
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,850
Mr. Buchanan, the president's on the line.

388
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,740
Mr. President. We have intelligence

389
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:45,770
that indicates President Suvarov's motorcade may be attacked in the next few minutes.

390
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,730
- Is that so?  - Yes, sir. We are notifying Secret Service.

391
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,280
What we can tell you is that if the attack happens,

392
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,750
it will occur in or around the downtown area.

393
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,350
The motorcade is approaching that area now, sir. 

394
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,390
Mr. President?

395
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,510
Bill, Mike Novick.

396
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,190
The president is at a loss for words. 

397
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:28,190
His wife is in the Suvarovs' limousine.

398
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,710
Thank you. You've done a good job.

399
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,150
- What do we do?  - There's nothing we can do, sir.

400
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,590
CTU is informing Secret Service.

401
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,990
They will no doubt take defensive measures,

402
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,350
which makes the attack substantially less likely to succeed.

403
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,270
- Red Protocol. Turn back.  - Protocol red! Protocol red!

404
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,790
Hold on tight. We're turning around. We just received intelligence about a threat.

405
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,410
They're turning around.

406
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,360
We're under attack. We need backup now!

407
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,800
That's a missile fire. The motorcade's been hit.

408
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,170
Aaron.

409
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,640
Aaron. Oh, God!

410
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,840
No!

411
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,430
Let's go! Let's go!

412
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,550
Are you OK?

413
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,710
- Novick.  - The motorcade's been attacked. 

414
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,110
- How badly?  - Bad. We sustained major casualties. 

415
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,230
- What about Mrs. Logan?  - They're shaken, but alive. Tell the president. 

416
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,110
I will. Thank you.

417
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,990
Your wife survived the attack.

418
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,950
CTU intervened in time.

419
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,140
Thank God.

420
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,030
What about the Suvarovs?

421
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,830
They were shaken up, but they'll be OK.

422
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,750
He's going to think I tipped off CTU.

423
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,550
It won't matter to him that I tried to keep my end of the bargain.

424
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,030
I agree.

425
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,270
We need to prepare ourselves for the terrorists' retaliation.

426
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,320
All the work on the Sentox project was run out of here.

427
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,600
- How restricted was access?  - Extremely.

428
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,280
For security reasons, each contract was run out of its own separate, dedicated bunker.

429
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:23,320
Each bunker is completely sealed. Nothing gets in and nothing gets out.

430
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,560
This is gonna take some time.

431
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,850
I've gotta merge some files, find out who worked on this.

432
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,760
You're senior VP. You don't know?

433
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:47,330
Give me a break. 8,000 people work for this company. I gotta run a sort. It'll take a minute.

434
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,970
So who's the honcho over at CTU now?

435
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,080
- Bill Buchanan.  - Buchanan?

436
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,640
What a stiff. No wonder everything's going to hell over there.

437
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,960
You guys keep getting rid of everybody who can do their job.

438
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,850
- You made your own bed.  - You accused the wrong man, Jack.

439
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,530
- I wasn't the lead investigator, I showed them what I found.  - I was framed.

440
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,810
- By who?  - Nina Myers, George Mason, who knows?

441
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:20,380
But I tell you, the one thing that just hangs on me, I'll tell you, the one thing that just... hurts me

442
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,750
is that you didn't believe me.

443
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,300
You made it impossible to believe you.

444
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,300
How could I possibly defend you? You couldn't even defend yourself.

445
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,190
No one gave me the chance.

446
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,630
OK, we've got something here. Lead scientist, head of project Sentox,

447
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,990
- Allen Burkett, PhD.  - I'm gonna need to speak to him.

448
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:53,220
Well, you're gonna have a problem. Died in a helicopter crash in Geneva two years ago.

449
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,270
Let's see what else we've got.

450
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,150
This is bizarre.

451
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,070
Two other senior scientists on the Sentox project, one drowned on a diving trip in the Bahamas,

452
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,600
the other burned to death in a car accident two weeks later. What the hell is going on?

453
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,670
CTU's gonna have to break it down. How do I upload files ready to transfer?

454
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,030
We need IT. They're next door.

455
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,110
I'm gonna get somebody to help us.

456
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,480
I'll let CTU know that we're sending the files over.

457
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,760
Hello?

458
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,880
Dammit!

459
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,830
Oh, my God!

460
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,630
How could I be so stupid?

461
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,390
- Yes?  - Yeah, it's me.

462
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,670
I listened to everything Bauer had to say about the ThumbDrive. CTU does not have enough information to hurt us.

463
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,740
What about Bauer?

464
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,060
Well, in about one minute, he'll be dead.

465
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,530
Agh!

466
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,610
Argh!

467
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,830
Look, tell the media we don't know how the terrorists found out

468
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,180
about the Suvarovs' route.

469
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,990
We're looking into it now.

470
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,780
Mike, I've been thinking that, diplomatically,

471
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,780
we should play up the fact Martha was in the vehicle.

472
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,540
- Why is that, sir?  - It'll get rid of suspicion we might've been shortchanging Suvarov's security....

473
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,350
There he is.

474
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,460
- Hello.  - I thought we had an understanding.

475
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,140
I had nothing to do with this. You have to believe me.

476
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,820
It was your job to make sure no one interfered with the attack on the Suvarovs.

477
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,380
It happened outside of my authority. I told no one.

478
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,510
If Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president,

479
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,710
then its new ally, the United States, will pay with the lives of its citizens.

480
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,750
Mr. President, this is our final conversation. Goodbye.

481
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,340
No! Wait!

482
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,460

﻿1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,720
We authenticated the data. Omicron made the Sentox for the military. Who's Henderson?

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,840
- Someone I worked for.   - Where?

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,140
CTU. He was the man who recruited me. Things ended badly between us.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,010
Are you accusing me of being in bed with terrorists?

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,940
I need access to Omicron's Sentox programme.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,900
I gotta merge files, find out who was working on this project. We need IT. They're next door.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,650
I listened to everything Bauer had to say. CTU does not have enough information to hurt us.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,030
- What about Bauer?  - In about one minute, he'll be dead.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,420
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,990
How could I be so stupid?

11
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,940
There might be an attack on Suvarov's motorcade.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,360
My people are not gonna chase that white elephant. They're trying to locate Sentox gas.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,190
Let people focus on their work or I will have you escorted out of here.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,950
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,270
- What?  - Section one-twelve.

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,450
Take Mr Stiles and Miss O'Brian. Put 'em in holding.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,030
And then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,790
I'm relieving you of your command under section one-twelve.

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,210
- Mrs Logan is with the Suvarovs.  - Get my wife on the phone.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,250
The terrorists were specific. If I don't allow them to attack the motorcade, 

21
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,850
they're going to release canisters of gas in multiple locations. You need to get out.

22
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,310
We're under attack. We need backup now!

23
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,940
We had an understanding.

24
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,450
It happened outside of my authority. I told no one.

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,740
If Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president, 

26
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,130
then its new ally, the United States, will pay with the lives of its citizens.

27
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,250
Mr President, this is our final conversation. Goodbye.

28
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,800
No. Wait!

29
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,640
- How long has he been conscious?  - Ten minutes.

30
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:26,390
Before you go in, you should be aware of something. Tony's been asking for his wife.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,850
- He doesn't remember.  - The explosion, but that's all.

32
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,610
- We have to tell him Michelle's dead.  - No. He's undergone severe trauma.

33
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,530
Stress will raise his blood pressure and make vascular damage worse.

34
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,870
Please, just hold off on telling him till his condition is stabilised.

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,140
Could you excuse us, please?

36
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,170
Tony.

37
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,270
- How are you feeling?  - They told me they took Michelle to Cedars.

38
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,810
Yes, they couldn't treat her here.

39
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,650
Why? How badly was she hurt?

40
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,240
Is she gonna be OK?

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,650
As far as I know, yes.

42
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,500
What's going on? They killed Palmer and they tried to kill Michelle and me.

43
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,330
David Palmer was the target. They killed him because he was going to expose someone

44
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,830
inside Logan's administration.

45
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,500
They set Jack up to take the fall.

46
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,800
- Did they get Jack?  - No. He's alive.

47
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,340
He's working with us on a provisional basis.

48
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,430
- Bill, I need to talk to Jack.  - You need to rest.

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,560
No, I don't need to rest. I need to talk to Jack. Now.

50
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,610
- I'll tell him.  - Thanks.

51
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,690
Could you do me a favour? Could you get a message to Michelle? Tell her I'm OK.

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,650
I will.

53
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,570
Tony.

54
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,620
We need you to get better.

55
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,150
This is Black Top One.  We're one minute out.

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,280
Copy, Black Top One. We're standing by.

57
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,660
Roger that.

58
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,700
The navy helicopter is on its way, ma'am. It'll take us back to the retreat.

59
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,380
He...

60
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,630
didn't warn the motorcade.

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,590
Ma'am?

62
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,750
Charles.

63
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,220
He knew about the attack, and...

64
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,850
he just let it happen, Aaron.

65
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,470
That can't be true.

66
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,650
He didn't just let it happen. He...

67
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,240
He gave the terrorists the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

68
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,360
Ma'am, why would he do that?

69
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,350
- How soon before you're ready?  - A couple of minutes.

70
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,510
I need to finish the arming mechanism.

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,300
Make sure you place the canister to maximise casualties.

72
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,930
It must look as if it was a primary target.

73
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,560
It'll be taken care of.

74
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,560
- Yes.  - Do you have the key card?

75
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,780
I'll have it within the hour.

76
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,530
There can be no miscues. I'm using up one of my canisters to create this diversion.

77
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,450
Without the key card, it's all for nothing. Call me when you have it.

78
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,290
I will.

79
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,840
- Hello?  - I'm going to be there soon.

80
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,350
- Make sure you bring the money.  - You'll have it.

81
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
And you'll have your precious card.

82
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,190
Careful. It's all we've got left.

83
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,360
Don't worry about it. In a little while, we'll be able to buy all you want.

84
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,950
Navy transport has arrived on site. I'll advise...

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,710
Mrs Logan and the Suvarovs have been treated.

86
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,790
The chopper's picking them up now.

87
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,710
- What do I say to my wife?  - She put you in an impossible situation.

88
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,510
It's my job to handle impossible situations and I failed, and not for the first time.

89
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,470
I should never have given in. I should have ordered back the motorcade.

90
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,230
Sir, with all due respect, you don't have time for self-recrimination. The attack failed.

91
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,570
We have to assume they'll make good their threat to use the Sentox on American soil.

92
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,320
Has CTU made progress? Or are they waiting for the other shoe to drop?

93
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,660
They're looking for a lead, working the scene where the motorcade was ambushed.

94
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,290
Bill. They're airlifting the bodies of the terrorists to CTU.

95
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,710
- When will they be here?  - Any minute.

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,210
- Let me know what you find.  - You got it.

97
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,550
- Jack's calling in.  - Put him on speaker.

98
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,220
We're in an emergency briefing. Bill wants to put you on speaker.

99
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,770
- I thought Lynn took Bill off the roster.  - Lynn's been relieved of duty.

100
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,560
- OK, fine. Put me on.  - All right.

101
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,850
- All right, you're on.  - Jack, what did you find at Omicron?

102
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,690
Henderson set up the deal that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.

103
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,450
He tried to kill me by blowing up a bunker Sentox was developed in.

104
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,080
I managed to survive, but the servers were destroyed. Henderson managed to escape.

105
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,870
- Chloe, are you there?  - Go ahead, Jack.

106
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,460
- Can you hack Henderson's computer?  - I did. Henderson's work station is clean.

107
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,470
He wiped his hard drive, but there's an active socket.

108
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,760
- What does that mean?  - He's exchanging data with a link.

109
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,510
Can you locate it?

110
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,810
Yeah, the registry listing is 5714 Tarrowood Drive, Toluca Lake.

111
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,900
- Tarrowood Drive? That's his home address.  - I'll send a tac team.

112
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,270
- No, Bill. I need to go in alone.   - Why?

113
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,440
Henderson's good. He'll detect a tac team moving in.

114
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,150
- How do you wanna play this?  - I'm the last person he expects to see.

115
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,030
I should be able to walk up to his front door.

116
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,830
All right, but I want you in constant contact.

117
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,370
Henderson is our primary link to finding this nerve gas.

118
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,380
I know. I'll get back to you.

119
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,810
You've reached Banco Buenos Aires.

120
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,520
Enter your party's extension, or press the star button for immediate assistance.

121
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,030
- Your identification code, please.  - 8477C, as in Charlie.

122
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,020
Yes, how can I help you?

123
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,820
I'd like after-hours access to my personal safety deposit box.

124
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,490
Yes, sir.

125
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,960
- Buchanan.  - Bill.

126
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,450
We found a schematic of some kind of ventilation system on one of the terrorists.

127
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,500
Since that's the way to deliver Sentox, this could be their next target.

128
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,550
- Do we know what building it's from?  - Not yet.

129
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,140
Building and safety are running it against their archive.

130
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,760
Upload it to Chloe and Edgar. I want them on this.

131
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,810
Better make it fast. There's a number handwritten in the margin. 18:00 hours.

132
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,020
- The attack could happen in the next hour.  - Yeah.

133
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,360
That was Curtis. He's going to upload schematics to our server.

134
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,110
This is the likely target of their next attack. There was a time on it.

135
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,660
- It could occur in the next hour.  - Where is it?

136
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,320
We don't know. The only thing Curtis could tell

137
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,200
is it's the ventilation in an industrial building.

138
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,960
- How big?  - Enough to hold several thousand. Let's find it.

139
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,260
- How are you doing, Tony?  - Fine.

140
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,090
Have you heard anything else on my wife's condition?

141
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,510
I haven't heard anything new.

142
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,680
Sorry.

143
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,740
- Tony.  - You have to get back to recovery.

144
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,210
- Get away from me.  - Almeida, please.

145
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,580
I said get away from me.

146
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,050
Tony, come on.

147
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,440
My God!

148
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,160
Michelle.

149
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,730
- Thank God that you're all right.  - Let go of me.

150
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,980
Sorry. I made a mistake. I didn't think I had any choice.

151
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,610
Charles.

152
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,320
It isn't just that you...

153
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,410
You didn't stand up to them.

154
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,580
You should've stood up to them.

155
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,630
Martha.

156
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,550
Yuri, Anya, I can't tell you how glad I am that you're both all right.

157
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,310
Thank you. It was awful.

158
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,970
I'm deeply embarrassed this could happen on US soil, 

159
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,440
but I promise you whoever did this will be brought to justice.

160
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,950
- Excuse me, Mr President.  - Of course.

161
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,240
We both know who is responsible for this.

162
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,920
We believe it was the group who attacked the airport, but we thought they were all killed.

163
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Obviously you were wrong.

164
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,170
The situation is more serious than you know.

165
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,590
The terrorists have possession of a military nerve agent.

166
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,050
They've threatened to use it against the population of LA.

167
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,680
- How long have you known?  - We just found out.

168
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,760
But given this change of circumstances, I'm asking you to honour the terms of our treaty.

169
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,810
Allow my law enforcement agencies access

170
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,910
to whatever intelligence your security people have on these separatists.

171
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,910
- You will have our help.  - Thank you.

172
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,330
I hope you won't find this offensive, but there's something that's been troubling me.

173
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,370
- What is it?  - Mrs Logan, her behaviour.

174
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,000
She has not been herself.

175
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,580
I'm sure she's very upset by what happened.

176
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,460
Yes, I imagine she would be, but I noticed this before the attack, 

177
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,420
from the time she entered the car with Anya and me.

178
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,850
The truth is my wife has been under a doctor's care for a while.

179
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,400
She suffers from depression and anxiety.

180
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,330
It's been very difficult for both of us.

181
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,790
- I'm sorry to hear that.  - Thank you.

182
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,210
- The guard said you wanted to see me.  - How long are you gonna keep me?

183
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,720
You're not going out there any time today. The district marshal's reviewing your case.

184
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,850
I need to ask you a favour, Bill. I know I don't deserve it. I was unfair to you earlier.

185
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,600
- What is it?  - I need to make a phone call.

186
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,940
If you think you can get out of this with a few phone calls, you're mistaken.

187
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,160
It's not that, I swear. I'll give you the number. You can clear it yourself.

188
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,820
What's this about?

189
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,860
My sister. I need to talk to her about a personal matter.

190
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,710
- It can't wait a few hours?  - No, it can't.

191
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,960
Bill, please. She's in a little bit of trouble and I'm the only one who can help her.

192
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,210
I don't need to clear it.

193
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,430
Get Mr McGill a phone and give him some privacy.

194
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,550
Thank you.

195
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,100
Thank you.

196
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,400
- Hello?  - Jenny, it's me.

197
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,410
Listen, I don't care that you took my wallet. You can keep everything that's in it.

198
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,790
- I just need to get my key card back.  - What key card?

199
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,040
My CTU access card. It's of no value to you, it just lets me in this building.

200
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,380
Can't you get them to give you a new one?

201
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,010
I mean, that's what I did when I lost the key to my laundry room.

202
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,730
Damm it, Jenny. This isn't a laundry room. This is a secure government building.

203
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,060
If you don't want me to call the police, you'll get me back the key card today.

204
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,560
- You hear me?  - Yeah, I do.

205
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,940
Listen, I gotta go.

206
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,070
- Where's that card from Lynn's wallet?  - Why?

207
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,240
- I wanna give him his card. We don't need it.  - That's how I'm getting us all this money.

208
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,540
You told me we were gonna take his cash and a credit card.

209
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,750
Yeah. I'm taking a credit card. A $20, 000 line of credit right here.

210
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,380
$20, 000?

211
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,560
Who's gonna pay you that kind of money?

212
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,980
- Yes, Mr President.  - I'd like to speak with my wife.

213
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,700
- I'm sorry, sir. She asked to be left alone.  - I wanna see my wife now. Move away.

214
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,360
Sir, she ordered me not to let anyone in.

215
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,860
I'm not "anyone", Evelyn.

216
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,210
I know, sir, but she specifically mentioned you.

217
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,310
I have to get to a meeting. Would you tell my wife I would like to speak with her?

218
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,180
Of course, Mr President.

219
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,740
Thank you.

220
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,910
I'd like you to find Aaron Pierce right now. I want to know how he's doing.

221
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,660
- Is there a message you want to get to him?  - If he's all right, tell him I'd like to see him.

222
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,910
Chloe, come here.

223
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,920
- I think I got a match.  - There's a discrepancy.

224
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,080
They're from different layers. Curtis's was structural. This is an electrical blueprint.

225
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,010
You're right. Mr Buchanan, Edgar matched the schematics we got from Curtis.

226
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,810
- Where is it?  - Tyler Memorial, Westwood.

227
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:24,020
A hospital. Tell Curtis to activate a tac team. I'll call Tyler Memorial, tell them to evacuate.

228
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,860
- Operations.  - Put me through to Tyler Memorial.

229
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,140
This is Bauer. I'm on site at the Henderson house. Do you copy?

230
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,640
We found intel on the body of a dead terrorist. There is going to be an attack.

231
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,180
- Where?  - Tyler Memorial, we think within the hour.

232
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,520
OK, I copy. I'm moving in now.

233
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,640
- Miriam.  - Who?

234
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,300
Christopher's wife. He's not here.

235
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,530
- Tell Chloe I'm gonna get back to her as soon as I have access to his computer.  - All right. We're on it.

236
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,030
This is Manning with CTU. I need to speak to the security officer on site.

237
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,490
- You're talking to him. Tom Wegman.  - I'm heading to you now with a tactical team.

238
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,040
The gas will most likely be released into a ventilation unit. Seal the subbasement.

239
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,080
- I've called in a second security shift.  - How long before the hospital's evacuated?

240
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,920
- An hour, maybe two.  - This attack could occur within 30 minutes.

241
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,580
This is a large facility, Agent Manning.

242
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,600
We have 600 patients, many of whom need assistance.

243
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Mr Wegman, if this nerve agent is released into the ventilation system, 

244
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,220
everyone inside that building will die.

245
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,850
Do what you have to do, but get those people out of that building.

246
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,190
Right.

247
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,960
Hello, Miriam.

248
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,830
My God!

249
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,540
We thought you were dead.

250
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,620
Where is he?

251
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,000
What are you doing, Jack?

252
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,220
Miriam, where's Christopher?

253
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,510
He's still at work.

254
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
- Did he call you?  - You're scaring me, Jack.

255
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,800
- In the last hour, has he called you?  - No!

256
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,980
Now tell me what the hell is going on.

257
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,490
I need to see his computer.

258
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,940
- What are you doing?  - Where is his computer?

259
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,330
I'm not gonna tell you anything until you tell me what is going on.

260
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,160
Christopher developed a chemical weapon system called Sentox nerve gas for Omicron.

261
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,630
He enabled terrorists to gain control of it. Now it's being used in Los Angeles.

262
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,470
So where is his computer?

263
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,760
Miriam, I am telling you the truth.

264
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,010
- We have proof that he brokered the deal.  - That's impossible.

265
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,350
Less than an hour ago, he tried to kill me.

266
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,230
Move towards the living room.

267
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,910
Keep walking towards the den. I want you to take a seat on the couch.

268
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,660
Look, why don't we just call him? I'm sure there's an explanation.

269
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,740
Miriam, take a seat.

270
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,970
You don't need the gun, Jack. You're not gonna shoot me.

271
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,820
Chloe, I need access to Henderson's hard drive. I need you to talk me through it.

272
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,070
OK, Jack.

273
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,790
Yes?

274
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,170
- You wanted to see me, ma'am?  - Oh, yes, Aaron. Come in.

275
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,790
I didn't really get a chance to say thank you before.

276
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,140
You saved my life. I know that you'll say it was all just in the line of duty.

277
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,680
Well, you're welcome.

278
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,240
The country's lucky to have men like you.

279
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,400
I'm lucky.

280
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,570
I hope you'll allow me to say that.

281
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,130
Mrs Logan.

282
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,470
Would you excuse us, Aaron?

283
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,310
What is it, Mike?

284
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,980
- The president's been trying to reach you.  - I know.

285
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,030
I don't want to see him.

286
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,410
Would you like me to convey that to him?

287
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,120
You can convey whatever you want, Mike.

288
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,880
Mike.

289
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,300
Mike, I want you to know nothing happened in there.

290
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,600
Whatever didn't happen, make sure it doesn't happen again.

291
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,360
- Clark, cover the north. Blake, you're with me.  - Manning?

292
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,530
- Yeah.  - Wegman, hospital security.

293
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,660
Thanks. Have you uplinked to CTU yet?

294
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,000
We're doing it now. We've doubled security at subbasement ingress points.

295
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,130
- Nobody's getting down there.  - Good.

296
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,800
The bad news is we have 26 patients in ICU that can't be moved.

297
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,130
Seven are high-dependency newborns.

298
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,600
We can't relocate them without specialised transport, which we don't have.

299
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,850
- What about nearby hospitals?  - All neonatal units are in service.

300
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,150
Thanks. I want a visual sweep of high-probability targets in the hospital.

301
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,700
Team A, start at the north end, team B, take south. Move.

302
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,550
It's Viktor. I'm at the hospital.

303
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,820
- Then why are you calling me?  - They must have found out.

304
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,980
The hospital's being evacuated. The elevators and stairs are guarded.

305
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,230
Calm down, Viktor. Bring up the schematics of the hospital.

306
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,280
There's an entrance to the subbasement ... an electrical conduit.

307
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,710
- There's a good chance it isn't guarded.  - How do I find it?

308
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,880
In the radiology wing. Call us when you're there. We'll talk you through it.

309
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:54,050
- I'll call you in a few minutes.  - And, Viktor, I need you to finish this task.

310
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,510
Even if it means you don't get out.

311
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,260
I won't fail you.

312
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,080
DOD concluded a briefing with Russian intelligence. We were given a name.

313
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:21,040
Vladimir Bierko. He made billions in the post-Soviet economy in weapons and oil.

314
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,670
He bankrolled publications promoting the separatist cause.

315
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,890
- It's believed he was more than a sympathiser.  - They think he's financing these attacks?

316
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,390
- They think he's directing the attacks.  - Based on what?

317
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,730
Communication intercepted by the Russian security force, 

318
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,430
supported by the fact that Bierko vanished three months ago.

319
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,480
We posted Bierko's profile to interagency servers.

320
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,650
Homeland Security has issued an emergency brief to local law enforcement.

321
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,530
Any hope of finding him before the attack?

322
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,450
The most promising lead is a man named Henderson. Unfortunately, he escaped.

323
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,540
Jack believes that files on Henderson's computer could lead to Bierko.

324
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,250
He's trying to acquire those files now, sir.

325
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,090
Let's hope he succeeds. The country's suffered three devastating attacks today.

326
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,720
- We need to stop this madman.  - Yes, Mr President.

327
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,770
- Chloe, have you found anything yet?  - The only thing on it is domestic stuff.

328
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,980
Bill-paying programs, music.

329
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,940
He isn't trading music files with his office. There's something else.

330
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,320
- I'm doing the best I can.  - Why don't you face it?

331
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:33,040
Christopher is innocent. He was when you forced him out of CTU, and he is now.

332
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,160
- Maybe you didn't hear. He tried to kill me.  - If he did, he was defending himself.

333
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,170
No, he blew up the server room while I was still inside.

334
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,960
He was destroying evidence that would've implicated him in this.

335
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:52,300
This is familiar ... you accusing him of being a criminal. Why do you hate him so much?

336
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,470
I want you to know something.

337
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,020
Chris never hated you, not even after what you did to him.

338
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,020
When he thought you were dead, he looked in on Kim. He cared about her, 

339
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,440
just like he cared about you. We both did. You know that.

340
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,070
- I found something.  - What is it?

341
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,110
- It's a shadow drive. It was partitioned.  - What's on the shadow drive?

342
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,750
A log. It contains data for every satellite call Henderson has made in the last year.

343
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,370
Can you cross-reference those with numbers the terrorists used?

344
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,710
I got into the log, but the lists are password protected.

345
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,590
Hold on. He had a secret file in his computer.

346
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,630
- There's a list of numbers.  - And that implicates him?

347
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,970
- We need access. You know the password?  - No, I don't.

348
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,760
We believe there's gonna be another attack within 30 minutes.

349
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,270
Thousands of lives are at stake. Please.

350
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,770
If you know that password, I need it now.

351
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,400
I can't help you.

352
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,210
- Chloe, try and hack in.  - I'll see what I can do.

353
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,030
Hurry.

354
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,620
Let me show this to Manning. Good work.

355
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,340
Agent Manning?

356
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,920
One of our guards caught this.

357
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,140
This guy's dressed as an orderly, but I've never seen him before.

358
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,090
An orderly has no business being where he is. That was five minutes ago.

359
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,180
- Where is this?  - Subbasement.

360
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,310
Team A, southeast stairwell. Team B, form a perimeter.

361
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,650
- We have a suspect. CTU, copy?  - We copy.

362
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,400
Edgar, uplink the video surveillance for facial recognition.

363
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,060
- See if you can get a match.  - Got it.

364
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,250
Curtis has a suspect. We're running facial recognition.

365
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,540
We're halfway through the database.

366
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,290
- Got something.  - Print it.

367
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,710
Curtis, we have a suspect. His name is Viktor Grigorin, a Russian national.

368
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,220
Served time for drug smuggling and weapons trafficking.

369
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,220
Copy that. All teams, suspect is a confirmed hostile.

370
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,690
Repeat, a confirmed hostile.

371
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,700
Freeze!

372
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,200
Don't move!

373
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,430
Agent Manning, you need to come look at this.

374
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,810
Search him.

375
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,470
Don't! It might be set to go off if it's moved.

376
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,430
- Chemical response team, we need you here.  - Copy that. On the way.

377
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,970
All teams, we've located the canister and it is armed. Repeat, the canister is armed.

378
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,380
CTU, the chemical response team is on the way.

379
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,080
Evacuation is in progress, but there are a lot of people in here.

380
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,970
Copy that, Curtis. Edgar, notify LAPD and all relevant agencies.

381
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,840
- I want a mandatory evacuation downtown.  - Yes, sir.

382
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,430
- Henderson's using interlaced encryption.  - What does that mean?

383
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,350
- It'll take me half a day to crack it.  - We don't have that kind of time.

384
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,940
Sorry. It's tougher than it looked at first glance, OK?

385
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,140
All right.

386
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,150
Jack, Curtis and his team intercepted a terrorist at the hospital.

387
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,700
- Did they take him into custody?  - No, he's dead. But they found a gas canister.

388
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:22,580
They're trying to disarm it now. There are patients there that can't be evacuated.

389
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,750
Chloe, there's nothing you can do about the hospital.

390
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,790
There are still 18 canisters out there. Stay focused.

391
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,670
- I know.  - If I got more personnel, would that help?

392
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,920
I've already got three analysts on it.

393
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,510
Miriam.

394
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,800
Miri ...

395
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,730
Honey, I want you to pack a bag. I want you ...

396
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,610
Don't you move.

397
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,100
Miriam, sit back down.

398
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,620
Put your hands behind your head, get back up on you knees. Now!

399
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:00,450
I want you to handcuff yourself behind your back.

400
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,750
Get up.

401
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,300
Take a seat next to Miriam on the couch.

402
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,540
- Are you OK, honey?  - I'm OK.

403
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,300
- How do I find the nerve gas?  - I have no idea.

404
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,560
- Where is it?  - Start with my knee, just like I taught you.

405
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,770
I don't know what you're talking about.

406
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,890
- Where is it?  - He doesn't know, Jack. He doesn't know!

407
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,190
For God's sake, leave him alone.

408
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,520
Christopher, CTU found one of the canisters at Tyler Memorial Hospital.

409
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,700
It's armed. People are gonna start dying. How do I find the nerve gas?

410
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:42,030
Jack, leave him alone! He doesn't know anything.

411
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,080
Do you really trust him?

412
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,260
Ask him what's in the briefcase.

413
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,180
Unlock it!

414
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,400
Ask him what he's doing with all the money. Ask him!

415
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,900
Christopher? Is this true?

416
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,250
- Have you been lying to me?  - I've been protecting you.

417
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,080
- By lying?  - It's not that simple.

418
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,380
- I defended you.  - I defended you too, because I love you.

419
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,090
There's not one thing I've done out of greed.

420
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,460
Even when they fired me ... framed me ... I served my country.

421
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,890
I don't care how you justify it. I am out of time.

422
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,140
You are gonna tell me now how to find the rest of the gas.

423
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,150
Go ahead and do it, Jack. Get it done. Shoot me.

424
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,720
Kneecap me. Go ahead, do it. Do it!

425
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,110
- Oh, you son of a bitch!  - I shot her above the knee. She can still walk.

426
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:06,450
If you make me shoot her again, she'll be in a wheelchair. How do I find the nerve gas?

427
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,200
Dammit!

428
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,420
- Where is it?  - Please. Please!

429
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,960
- Don't you make me do this.  - Tell him what he wants to know.

430
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,930
I can't.

431
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,340
I can't.

432
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,640
Forgive me, Miriam.

433
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,850
You son of a bitch.

434
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,360
You don't care about anybody.

435
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,070
Not even her.

436
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,700
Chloe, it's Jack. I need an ambulance on site. I repeat, I need an ambulance on site.

437
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:48,450
Miriam Henderson's been shot. I'm bringing Christopher Henderson into CTU.

438
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,790
I need an interrogation room prepped, and a medic with hyoscine pentothal.

439
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,130
- It'll be ready. Are you OK?  - Yeah, I'm fine, just get the ambulance here.

440
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,500
- The team's on its way.  - Put Buchanan on.

441
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,430
Mr Buchanan, Jack's on line one.

442
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,220
- Jack.  - What's happening at the hospital?

443
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,010
There's a CRT team on site. Stand by, Jack.

444
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,480
- Curtis, what's your status?  - We're still trying to defuse the detonator.

445
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,650
- Look what we found.  - Is the evacuation on track?

446
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,740
- Hold on, Bill.  - It's a remote timing display.

447
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,080
- Can you defuse the detonator?  - Not in 60 seconds.

448
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,670
- Then we're gonna have to get it out of here.  - It could detonate if you move it.

449
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,910
That's a chance we'll have to take.

450
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,470
All teams, we're moving the canister to the containment unit. All right, go, go!

451
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,760
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, let's go!

452
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,510
All teams, clear the halls. Clear the halls, we're coming through. Go, go, go, go!

453
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,970
Make sure the door's open. Make sure the door's open.

454
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,020
Go! Come on! We're coming upstairs. We're coming upstairs.

455
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,020
Go! Go! Move! Move! Move!

456
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:03,240
Go, go, go! Clear the hall! Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

457
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,200
Keep the halls clear! Coming through!

458
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,580
- Go!  - I need to clear this hall.

459
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,250
Get them out of the way. Go! Move! The hall's clear.

460
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,290
Move! Move!

461
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,420
I need to clear this area. Move back!

462
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:24,010
- Step aside, please.  - Get the door open!

463
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,220
Come on!

464
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,800
All right, get it in there.

465
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,680
We have negative pressure.

466
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,650
Clear!

467
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,280
CTU, the canister detonated inside a containment unit.

468
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,450
- The hospital's safe.  - Good work.

469
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:33,040
- I have the key card.  - How long will it take you to reprogram it?

470
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,950
Five minutes. Then we will be able to use it to access CTU.

471
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,120
Good.
﻿1
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,210
- Your wife survived the attack.  - Thank God. 

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,900
I should never have given in. I should have ordered back the motorcade. 

3
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,860
The attack failed. 

4
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:26,360
We have to assume they'll make good their threat to use the Sentox on American soil. 

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,700
Sorry. I made a mistake. I didn't think I had any choice. 

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,030
Charles. You didn't stand up to them. 

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,660
- You saved my life.  - Well, you're welcome. 

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,610
The country's lucky to have men like you. I'm lucky. 

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,340
Mrs Logan. 

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,880
Henderson set up the deal that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox. 

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,340
He left me for dead. 

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,300
Henderson is our primary link. 

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,180
You are gonna tell me now how to find the rest of the gas. 

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,560
Go ahead and do it, Jack. Get it done. Shoot me. 

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,610
- Oh, you son of a bitch!  - I shot her above the knee. She can still walk. 

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,230
If you make me shoot her again, she'll be in a wheelchair. 

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,860
- Tell him what he wants to know.  - I can't. 

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,410
I'm bringing Christopher Henderson into CTU. I need an interrogation room prepped. 

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,040
I don't care that you took my wallet. I just need to get my key card back. 

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,080
It's of no value to you, it just lets me in this building. 

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,330
You told me we were gonna take his cash and a credit card. 

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,920
That's how I'm getting us all this money. A $20, 000 line of credit right here. 

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,930
Who's gonna pay you that kind of money?

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,520
- I have the key card.  - How long will it take you to reprogram it?

25
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,980
Five minutes. Then we will be able to use it to access CTU. 

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,150
Good. 

27
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,250
Yes?

28
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,350
- I'm reprogramming the CTU key card now.  - Will it work?

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,350
I need to change the ID but preserve McGill's executive entry privileges. 

30
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,520
- It won't be a problem.  - Good. 

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,310
Our couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets. 

32
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,570
- When are you launching the attacks?  - After you're done at CTU. 

33
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,870
I'm a few minutes out. Call me when you're there. 

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,120
Understood. 

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,460
We neutralised the attack on the hospital. 

36
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,630
Good. Do we have any idea what the terrorists' next target might be?

37
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,100
We're working with state authorities to harden security around the highest-value targets. 

38
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,770
In other words, no. We're just sitting around waiting for Bierko to hit us again. 

39
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,260
We do have one promising lead, sir. 

40
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,150
Jack Bauer was able to recapture the man who escaped, Christopher Henderson. 

41
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,590
Henderson was a defence contractor who brokered the sale of the nerve gas to Bierko. 

42
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,830
Is this the same Christopher Henderson who worked at CTU?

43
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,830
Yes, sir. He was head of field ops. Jack brought him down on corruption charges. 

44
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,460
And this Henderson knows how to find Bierko?

45
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,300
We believe so. He's not cooperating. Jack's bringing him in for further interrogation. 

46
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,600
- Keep me posted on any progress.  - Yes, sir. 

47
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,180
Mr Buchanan. Tony Almeida's been asking to see you down in the clinic. 

48
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
I don't have time now. Tell him I'll get to him as soon as I can. 

49
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,020
And Ms Raines, Kim Bauer is here. 

50
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,570
She's just clearing Security. 

51
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,580
- Put her in the field ops office, please.  - Yes, ma'am. 

52
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,680
- What's Kim Bauer doing here?  - Jack asked me to call her. 

53
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,050
Does she know?

54
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,350
Not yet. 

55
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,690
- Who's with her?  - I don't know, but I'll find out from Security. 

56
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,740
- This is Bauer.  - Hey, it's me. 

57
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,540
- Is Burke prepped for the interrogation?  - Yes. 

58
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,580
Jack, Kim just arrived at CTU. 

59
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,340
- What did you say to her?  - Nothing yet. 

60
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,460
Good. I want her to hear it from me. 

61
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,130
Jack, it might be easier for her if she knows that you're alive before she sees you. 

62
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,970
- When I first saw you... It... it's just... - Yeah, I know. 

63
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,180
I... I understand. 

64
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,470
Look, when you talk to her, 

65
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,070
explain that I couldn't tell her I was still alive cos I was trying to protect her. 

66
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,490
- Of course I will.  - Audrey, thank you. 

67
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,540
Kim's at CTU right now. 

68
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,750
You know, after you died, Chase left her. 

69
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,170
She hit bottom. Did you know that?

70
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,090
It's only right now she's putting her life back together. 

71
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,090
Maybe you did know but couldn't do anything about it. 

72
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,180
- This doesn't concern you.  - I think it concerns me. 

73
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,020
Miriam and I were there for Kim when you weren't. 

74
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,980
Whatever you may think of me, Miriam and I love that girl. 

75
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,570
Are you OK?

76
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,120
Both my parents died here. 

77
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,250
- I swore I'd never come back to this place.  - We can leave right now if you want. 

78
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,420
Here, she's coming. 

79
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,130
Kim. 

80
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,840
- Hi.  - Hi. 

81
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,050
This is Barry Landes.  - Hi. 

82
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,970
Audrey Raines. 

83
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,010
So, what it is? What did you have to tell me that was so important?

84
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,770
- It would be better if we talked in private.  - You can say it in front of Barry. 

85
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,270
- Kim, I really think... - No, no. It's OK. 

86
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,120
It's about your father. 

87
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,540
What about my father?

88
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,410
He's alive. 

89
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,750
Kim, he wanted to tell you but he couldn't, in order to protect you. 

90
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,840
Someone in the government wanted your father dead, 

91
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,800
so he staged his own death and went underground. 

92
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,390
He knew that you wouldn't be safe if he told you that he was alive. 

93
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,270
I didn't know either until this morning. 

94
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,870
I thought maybe if I told you now before you saw him it might be a little bit easier. 

95
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
He's on his way in now to CTU. 

96
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,670
Hello, Mike. 

97
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,630
Mr Vice President. I thought you were at Salt Lake City today. 

98
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,470
Hal cancelled his engagements to be here, Mike. 

99
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,770
We need all hands on deck to deal with this situation. 

100
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,230
- Of course, Mr President.  - OK. So, what's on your mind, Hal?

101
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,480
Mr President, when these terrorists attack you're gonna need to maintain order. 

102
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,410
And I submit to you the plan you're implementing with CTU is inadequate. 

103
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,460
Sir, it was drawn up after careful study for an attack of just this magnitude. 

104
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,670
CTU is already coordinating with first responders. 

105
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,050
Fine, and they should still do so. 

106
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,760
But what I'm proposing is something far more sweeping. 

107
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,850
I believe it's warranted by the facts. Andrew. 

108
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,560
To begin with, I'm revising all of CTU's casualty estimates. 

109
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,720
Based on the assumptions the terrorists will hit all of these targets... hospitals, malls, 

110
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,110
sporting arenas, transit hubs...

111
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,490
my low estimate is 400, 000 casualties. 

112
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,290
- That's a considerable upward revision.  - I'd like to know how you reached it. 

113
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,950
You're free to talk to my working group. 

114
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,960
There are a lot of people who don't take this threat seriously enough. 

115
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,800
I assure you we're taking it very seriously. We have no agenda but to do so. 

116
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,800
What's your recommendation?

117
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,310
We should think of a pre-emptive declaration of martial law in the greater Los Angeles area. 

118
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,150
Mr President, martial law is appropriate only as a last-ditch measure. 

119
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,980
- Not as a pre-emptive one.  - Go on. 

120
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,860
Every study we've done has shown it would incite more unrest, not less. 

121
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,620
- And you'd need approval from Congress.  - Which is why we won't call it martial law. 

122
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,950
We're putting troops on the street to try to keep people from killing each other. 

123
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,460
The panic hasn't happened. Right now the public isn't even aware of a threat. 

124
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,630
You declare martial law, you'll have to tell them. 

125
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,310
- How long will it take to deploy the troops?  - I'm in touch with the Pentagon. 

126
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,560
The National Guard is on stand-by pending your decision. 

127
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:46,310
I agree there's a case to be made, but for God's sake, let's make it to Congress. 

128
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,320
- We can declare an emergency... - We don't have time. 

129
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,150
Hal is right. This attack could take place any minute. 

130
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,530
If CTU can't find this man Bierko, we're gonna get hit. 

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,250
It would be smart to have control of the streets. 

132
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,390
- This is a mistake. You don't wanna do this.  - Get out. 

133
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,640
I'll get immediate immunity if I talk. You know it and I know it. I'm not gonna ask for it. 

134
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,910
I'm not trying to protect myself. I'm trying to protect this country. 

135
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,560
- What do you mean?  - You don't wanna know what I know. 

136
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,500
You get me to talk, I promise you you'll just be opening Pandora's box. 

137
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,250
Tell me. Let me judge that for myself. 

138
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,700
That's what I thought. 

139
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,010
- I'll set him up in Holding.  - Let me know when he's ready. 

140
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,180
Jack. 

141
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,150
Key card, please. 

142
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,880
Well, all clear, sir. 

143
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,050
Go ahead. 

144
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,480
Yeah. OK, I will. 

145
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,940
Curtis is on his way back from the hospital. 

146
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,120
OK, good. 

147
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,410
Audrey. 

148
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,050
Did you speak to Kim? What was her reaction?

149
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,930
She's a little confused. She's here with someone. I think it might be her boyfriend. 

150
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,560
His name is Barry Landes. 

151
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,100
- Where is she?  - She's in the field ops office. 

152
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,820
- OK, thanks.  - Yeah. 

153
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,420
Hey. 

154
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,150
I don't know what to say. I don't know what you expect me to say. 

155
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,980
You don't have to say anything. 

156
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,400
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive?

157
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,950
I couldn't. If you knew I was alive you would have been at risk. 

158
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,620
- I had no choice.  - You could have chosen to trust her. 

159
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,170
- I'll speak with my daughter alone.  - That's not a good idea. 

160
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,340
- I don't care what you think.  - I'm sure you don't. 

161
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,120
All that matters is you, even if it affects those that love you. 

162
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,640
Kim. 

163
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,100
Barry, please let me speak to my dad. 

164
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,560
- I'll be right outside.  - Yeah. 

165
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,200
Don'tjudge him. 

166
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,070
He was there when no one else was. 

167
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,710
The most painful thing that I've ever been through

168
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,590
was having to walk away from you. 

169
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,600
Even more painful than losing your mother. 

170
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,230
But it was the only way to make sure that you would be safe. 

171
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,890
I buried you. 

172
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,230
I know. 

173
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,480
You know, there's something wrong with people like you. 

174
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,950
You can't hold on to anything. 

175
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,830
Chase couldn't either. He tried for a while, then he was gone, just like you. 

176
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,540
And now you're back, 

177
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,120
and I'm just supposed to...

178
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,890
I'm happy that you're alive. I am. 

179
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,970
But I can't give you what you want right now. 

180
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,730
OK. OK. 

181
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,610
I understand that. 

182
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,940
- I need you to know that I'm sorry and I... - Please, just go. 

183
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,250
Excuse me. Burke needs you in Holding. 

184
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,740
I'll be there in a minute. 

185
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,680
I've gotta go. Barry's got a conference. We have a plane to catch. 

186
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,850
Please, Kim. 

187
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,340
I want you to stay just a little longer. 

188
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,190
There's some things that I still need to tell you. 

189
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,060
Please. 

190
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,280
I'll talk to Barry. 

191
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,900
Fine. 

192
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,240
I'll be right back. 

193
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,890
- You called for me, Tony?  - Yeah. 

194
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,570
- What's going on?  - That's what I wanted to ask you. 

195
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,140
What do you mean?

196
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,730
What do you think I mean, Bill?

197
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,240
My wife was killed this morning right in front of my eyes. 

198
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,580
- Nobody here's told me who did it or why.  - The investigation's ongoing. 

199
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,420
Come on, Bill. 

200
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,790
I used to work here. 

201
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,010
I know that's what you say to people when you don't wanna tell them the truth. 

202
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:58,630
The truth is you're not an agent any more. What you're asking me is classified. 

203
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,130
Tony, there's nothing you can do. 

204
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,060
I know there's nothing I can do! Look at me, for God's sake. 

205
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,310
I just wanna know who did it. 

206
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:16,030
For the sake of all the years I've given this place, I think I deserve to know, don't you?

207
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,290
All I can tell you is...

208
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,080
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan

209
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,000
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas. 

210
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,670
Who was behind it?

211
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,130
Who's responsible, Bill?

212
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,940
The highest we've got is someone you might know from when he worked here. 

213
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,190
Christopher Henderson. 

214
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,810
W... what?

215
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,820
Why?

216
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,390
We're working on it, Tony. 

217
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,780
Don't let him get away with this, Bill. 

218
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,200
- Don't you let him cut a deal.  - I won't. 

219
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,870
What do we know about the man who's with Kim?

220
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,410
He's registered with the state as a clinical psychologist. 

221
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,170
- She was his patient.  - I think so, yes. 

222
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,090
He's ready. 

223
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,480
Whatever he's not telling us is important. 

224
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,850
He knows what's coming...

225
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,190
and he's willing to tolerate an inhuman amount of pain. Open the door. 

226
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,670
Dammit, Christopher. 

227
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,510
I don't think you became a part of this because of self-interest. 

228
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,720
I believe you think what you're doing now is the best thing for this country, 

229
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,350
but it is not your choice to make. 

230
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,980
That's good. Disarm your subject's resolve by showing empathy and respect for his agenda. 

231
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,110
This is not a joke. 

232
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,490
Thousands of lives are at stake. 

233
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,830
People that we promised to protect, to make feel safe. 

234
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,330
There is enough time for you to tell me what I need to know to stop this insanity. Please. 

235
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,620
I'm sorry, Jack. 

236
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,800
I really am, but I can't tell you what you wanna know. 

237
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,180
Start it. 

238
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,850
Mrs Logan. 

239
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,060
- Mrs Logan, if I could have a minute?  - If this is about Aaron it doesn't concern you. 

240
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,400
No, Mrs Logan, it doesn't, and I'm not here to discuss it. 

241
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,070
- Then what is it?  - The country's facing a crisis. 

242
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,870
The president needs you. 

243
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,120
He... he needs me?

244
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:57,170
If you think the decision to let the attack on the motorcade proceed was easy for him, 

245
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,920
you're wrong. 

246
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,590
I was with him when he got down on his knees and prayed. 

247
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,050
- He did?  - He loves you. 

248
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,850
He didn't wanna lose you. 

249
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:17,060
But with the... the lives of so many people in jeopardy, he felt he had no choice. 

250
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:28,700
We've known each other a long time. Stop talking about what a positive influence I am

251
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:33,990
and tell me precisely what it is you're trying to get me to do. 

252
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:44,000
Vice President Gardner is advising your husband declare martial law in Los Angeles

253
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,380
in preparation for the release of the nerve gas. 

254
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,390
He wants to do it without Congressional sanction or a timetable to lift it. 

255
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,980
- He can't just rewrite the law.  - Hal's got an agenda. 

256
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,020
Well, he's wrong. This'll make things far worse. 

257
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:05,180
Mrs Logan, all I know is the president is listening to Hal Gardner, 

258
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:11,200
and it will only help the country to have him listening to you as well. 

259
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:05,540
Hold off on deploying units seven to twelve until we finalise our scenarios. What is it?

260
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,010
I noticed that one of the environmental systems put out a trouble flag. 

261
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,260
It's probably a circuit board change. 

262
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,680
I logged on to the manifest and there's nothing scheduled. 

263
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:21,110
Carrie, I'm in the middle of coordinating the first responders. I don't have time for this. 

264
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,860
You don't have to snap at me. I thought someone should check it out. 

265
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,480
Then check it out. 

266
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,490
Carrie!

267
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,470
Can you forgive me?

268
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,720
You acted like the President of the United States. 

269
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,890
Yes, I did. 

270
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,770
But you wanted me to be your husband first. 

271
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,270
I can't pretend that I didn't. 

272
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,870
I still love you as much as I always did. 

273
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,290
- Marty... - Shh. Shh. 

274
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,380
There'll be plenty of time for us later. 

275
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,800
You have to get back to work. 

276
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,800
The country needs you more than I do. 

277
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,310
Hello?

278
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,480
Anybody working on the system?

279
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,300
Chloe. 

280
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,580
Hi, Kim. 

281
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,600
- You're still here.  - Yeah. 

282
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,140
My father had to do something. Do you know how long he'll be?

283
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,350
- No. Sorry.  - Chloe...

284
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm kinda busy right now. 

285
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,270
You knew my father was alive, didn't you?

286
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,490
For a year-and-a-half you've known. 

287
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,910
Yeah. 

288
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,330
- He trusted you.  - Because he had to. I helped stage his death. 

289
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,630
- You don't have to make excuses.  - I'm not make excuses. Four people knew he was alive. 

290
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,300
Two are dead, President Palmer and Michelle Dessler. Tony Almeida's in serious condition. 

291
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,220
Michelle's dead?

292
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,220
I'm only alive because your dad found me in time. 

293
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,930
I know this is hard for you and it's none of my business, but you should cut him some slack. 

294
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,780
What's going on, Bill?

295
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,870
Lynn...

296
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,330
What is it?

297
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,250
We just got a call from LAPD. 

298
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,260
They found your sister's body in her apartment. 

299
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,920
She'd been shot. 

300
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,690
What? I...I just talked to her. 

301
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,390
I saw her today. That's impossible. She can't...

302
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,470
I'm sorry, Lynn. 

303
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,860
The police ID'd her body. 

304
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,110
My God. 

305
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:48,780
If you need a phone to make some personal calls or talk to the police...

306
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,210
Her boyfriend did this to her. 

307
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,680
Tell me he's in custody. 

308
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,010
- Is his name Dwayne Thompkins?  - Yeah. 

309
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,520
He didn't do it. They found his body too. 

310
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,360
Lynn, the police are trying to make sense of something. 

311
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:16,990
Do you know if either your sister or her boyfriend were involved in dealing drugs

312
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,780
or had ties to organised crime?

313
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,170
She was a pretty serious user. 

314
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,550
But organised crime? No way. 

315
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,720
Why?

316
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,350
The killings were clearly the work of a professional. 

317
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,850
My God. 

318
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,970
- Who's investigating? I have to talk to 'em.  - I can arrange a meeting. 

319
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,850
No. They have to search the apartment, see if my key card was there. 

320
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,200
- What are you talking about?  - My CTU key card. She has it. 

321
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:04,410
- What was she doing with your key card?  - It was stolen from me. Alright, Her boyfriend took it. 

322
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,120
- Why didn't you report this?  - I am now. We don't have time to argue. 

323
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,670
Call and see if anyone used it to breach Security. It was taken about four hours ago. 

324
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,850
Chloe, I'm in Holding with Lynn. I need you to check the gate logs now. 

325
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,850
- What am I looking for?  - If anyone used Lynn's key card to enter CTU. 

326
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,230
- Isn't Lynn standing right next to you?  - Chloe, do it!

327
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,860
It's showing that his card was used less than an hour ago at the executive entrance. 

328
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,240
- He was already here.  - Lock down CTU now. 

329
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,080
This is Chloe O'Brian. Initiate a lockdown now. 

330
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:52,670
Mr Bauer, I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on. He should be talking by now. 

331
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,340
Dammit, Christopher. I don't wanna do this. 

332
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,050
- Just talk to me.  - Can't. 

333
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,560
I need to stabilise him in the clinic before administering another dose. 

334
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,980
This is Bauer. 

335
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,480
We've been compromised. Someone used a stolen key card to access CTU. 

336
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,240
- Did you get an ID?  - Not yet. 

337
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,780
They're still here. We're in lockdown. 

338
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm on my way. Get him to Medical. Stabilise him. Don't let anyone near him. 

339
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,610
- Did you get him?  - Still working on it. Exits are sealed. 

340
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,700
Security are going room to room. 

341
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,410
Give me a comm unit. Is Kim still up in field ops?

342
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,620
- With Landes, yes.  - Get her here. I want a guard on her. 

343
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,920
- I found the hostile. He's in third west. Could exit south or north. 

344
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,840
Jack, take north. Mack's team will head south. 

345
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,960
Copy that. 

346
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,010
Pull up north and south angles. 

347
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,630
There he is.  - Run his face through recognition software. 

348
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,680
Where's Carrie? I need her to check for intrusions. 

349
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,560
She's checking on a warning signal on a B socket. 

350
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,940
Got it. Checking the grid. 

351
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,660
You're gonna help me get outta here. 

352
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,210
- He's in the north corridor.  - I wanna see what's keeping Carrie. 

353
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,880
All units, the hostile's in the north corridor. He's got one of our men. 

354
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,860
- Enter your pass code.  - But it's a lockdown. 

355
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,910
Just do it. 

356
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,550
He's in the north hallway, sublevel B. 

357
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,350
- Jack, do you read?  - On my way. 

358
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,790
- Bill, he's in the stairwell.  - I don't think so, Jack. 

359
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,380
- Davis said he checked sublevel B.  - Bill. 

360
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,550
It's all clear. 

361
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,890
No, he's doubled back.  He's using the stairs to get to the roof. 

362
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,230
All right, Jack. I'm sending units to the landings. 

363
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,440
Let me know when you're ready to move. 

364
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,610
Copy that. 

365
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,460
Freeze!

366
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,670
Let me see your hands. 

367
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,340
Slowly. 

368
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,420
Drop the gun. 

369
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,050
Now!

370
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,520
Hostile's down. He's dead. It was the only shot I had. 

371
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,610
Do you have an ID, Jack?

372
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,410
We got a bigger problem than that. He's got a device on him. Looks like a relay switch. 

373
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,040
- He's got a PDA. Oh, my God.  - What is it, Jack?

374
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,620
A schematic of CTU's ventilation system. I think he tried to deploy nerve gas. 

375
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,130
Order an evacuation. Code six! Everybody out! Go! Go!

376
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,380
- I have Kim with me.  - Stay with her. 

377
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,930
Make sure Burke gets Henderson outta here as fast as he can. 

378
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,260
- I'm on it. Don't move. I'll be right back.  - O'Brian. 

379
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,350
- Chloe, what's going on?  - Edgar, get out of the building now. 

380
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,190
Carrie. 

381
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,850
We have to get out of the building now. Just hurry. 

382
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,630
What's wrong with those people? Oh, my God. 

383
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,100
- The gas is coming in.  - The ducts run from the outside in. 

384
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,030
- Outside in? What does that mean?  - They reach the building core last. 

385
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,790
Lock the outer doors. Which rooms can we seal?

386
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,950
- I'm working on it!  - Burke, I need you to stand by. 

387
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,240
I'll let you know where you can move Henderson. 

388
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,580
- Chloe, what rooms can you lock down?  - Hold on!

389
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,210
The situation room, the upper offices and clinic isolation. 

390
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,160
- Go, people!  - Kim, everybody, in the situation room. Now. 

391
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:53,800
Burke, you can move Henderson to the clinic isolation. Seal it off for bio-air. 

392
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,670
Get into the situation room now. Move!

393
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,100
Chloe, seal it. Seal all the rooms. 

394
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,030
Open the door! You have to let me in! Open the door. 

395
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,980
- Let her in.  - We can't break the seal. Find another exit. 

396
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,490
Hurry! Go!

397
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:26,130
- Chloe, are the rest of the rooms sealed?  - Yes, it's done. 

398
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,120
Everybody, stay calm. There's nothing we can do for her now. 

399
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,460
Oh, no. 

400
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,210
Oh, my God. 

401
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,390
Chloe. 

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,680
I'm reprogramming the CTU key card right now. 

2
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,970
Good. Couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets. They'll be in place soon. 

3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,980
- When are you launching the attacks?  - After you're done at CTU. 

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,060
When these terrorists attack, you'll need to maintain order. 

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,780
We should think of a pre-emptive declaration of martial law in the greater Los Angeles area. 

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,790
If CTU can't find this man Bierko, we're gonna get hit. 

7
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,210
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive?

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,070
If you knew I was alive you would have been at risk. I had no choice. 

9
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,580
I'm happy that you're alive. I am. 

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,510
But I can't give you what you want right now. 

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,720
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,430
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas. 

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,680
- Who was behind it?  - Christopher Henderson. 

14
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,730
Whatever he's not telling us is important. He can tolerate an inhuman amount of pain. 

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,900
Thousands of lives are at stake. Tell me what I need to know to stop this insanity. Please. 

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,410
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't tell you what you wanna know. 

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,450
This is Bauer. 

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:26,080
We've been compromised. Someone used a stolen key card to access CTU. 

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,740
Freeze! Drop the gun. 

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Bill, it's Jack. I think he tried to deploy nerve gas. 

21
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,590
Code six! Everybody out! Go! Go!

22
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,550
Seal all the rooms. 

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,140
Oh, no. 

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,690
Oh, my God. 

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,650
Chloe. 

26
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,260
Attention all CTU personnel. 

27
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,930
This facility has been contaminated with Sentox VX-1 nerve gas. 

28
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,730
I repeat, this facility has been contaminated. 

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,440
There are two safe zones. On the main floor, in the situation room and Medical. 

30
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,150
On the second floor, the safe zones are the CTU director's office, 

31
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,950
and holding room four. 

32
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,690
These areas must remain sealed pending the arrival of the Chemical Response Team. 

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,620
If you are in any of these sealed areas, do not attempt to leave

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,460
until the CRT clears the environment. 

35
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,010
I'm on my way, but it could take 30 minutes to gather all the CRT personnel you need. 

36
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,640
I understand, Curtis, but we need CRT here now. This is a high priority. 

37
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,100
- Get here as fast as you can.  - Copy. I'll call in a few minutes with updates. 

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,590
Excuse me. 

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,110
- This is Bauer.  - Jack, it's Bill. I just talked to Curtis. 

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,270
He's with the Chemical Response Team. 

41
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,530
- They won't get here for at least 30 minutes.  - Why not?

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,120
Most were sent to Tyler Memorial. The rest are en route to high probability targets. 

43
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,950
We'll keep working. Our networks are up, right?

44
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,580
The phones are working, computers are up. I can coordinate with Division from here. 

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,790
- What do you need?  - I need to know if Henderson's alive. 

46
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,460
- Where is he?  - Agent Burke took him to the isolation clinic. 

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,670
I don't know if they made it. 

48
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,760
- You can tell if you pull up a grid.  - What about CTU's response plan?

49
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,060
Gas masks are in the armoury, atropine's in storage. 

50
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,520
Both areas are contaminated. We can't get to them without being exposed. 

51
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,020
Bill, I'm gonna have to get right back to you. 

52
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,570
Chloe, I know how difficult this is, but there's nothing we can do for him. 

53
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,450
I need you to come back to work. 

54
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,750
Tell me how to pull up a building grid. I'll do it myself. 

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,330
- Jack, we can try to pull it up.  - Get started. 

56
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,540
Chloe, CTU is immobile right now. Everything is going to go through Comm. 

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,880
That's you. I need you back at work. 

58
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,430
- Can't.  - Yes, you can. 

59
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,930
- I can't.  - Yes, you can!

60
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,220
Mr Bauer. 

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,940
- What?  - I can help her. 

62
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,150
I'm a clinical psychologist. 

63
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,990
Thank you. 

64
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,870
Chloe. 

65
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,130
My name's Dr Landes. He was a friend of yours. What was his name?

66
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,260
- Edgar.  - Edgar. 

67
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,840
I'd like you to turn away from Edgar and focus on me, please. 

68
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,720
Chloe, 

69
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,100
you're in shock, and I'd like to help you through it. 

70
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,600
The only thing I'm gonna ask you to do is sit in this chair and collect your breath. 

71
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,020
Let's do that now. 

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Just collect your breath, just for a second. 

73
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,990
He was such a good guy. I just treated him like crap all day. 

74
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,930
- This is my fault.  - Sir?

75
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,430
Someone stole my key card and used it to get in the building. 

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,350
It was missing, and I didn't say anything. 

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,850
- Why not?  - I thought they stole my wallet for money. 

78
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,650
How could you not report it?

79
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,490
I was embarrassed. 

80
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,950
I didn't want anyone to know I got beat up. 

81
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,330
So we're all gonna die because you were embarrassed?

82
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,040
- What are you doing?  - I wanna know what's going on. 

83
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,340
- No, I can't allow that.  - I won't sit in bed while CTU's under attack. Understand?

84
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,180
Fine. 

85
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,470
- How long are we supposed to be like this?  - I haven't received any news. 

86
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,890
Oh, my God. 

87
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,980
Jack, we've got the building grid. 

88
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,490
- Buchanan.  - It's Jack. The grid's up. 

89
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,650
All right. Check the isolation zones that have logged in. They'll have survivors. 

90
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,080
Two zones have logged on in Medical. 

91
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,250
- Try them. I'm gonna keep this line open.  - OK. Hold on. 

92
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,090
- Clinic.  - Dr Besson, it's Jack Bauer. 

93
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,420
What's going on?

94
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,880
A terrorist infiltrated CTU and deployed Sentox through the ventilation system. 

95
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,560
That's why we sealed off rooms. I need to know if Burke got to Medical with Henderson. 

96
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,680
- Yes, he did.  - Henderson's here right now?

97
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,230
- Tony, is that you?  - Jack, How long are we gonna be locked down?

98
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,070
Right now we're in stand-by. We're trying to figure out how to clean out the air supply. 

99
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,900
Doctor Besson?

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,370
Doctor Besson?

101
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,410
Tony?

102
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,500
- Get a security feed.  - This program's not set up for that. 

103
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,280
Try a redirect. Doctor Besson?

104
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,390
- What are you doing?  - Move aside. 

105
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,020
All right, I've got video. 

106
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,360
Oh, God. He's got a gun. Patch me through to their intercom. 

107
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,200
- Do it.  - We can hear them, but they can't hear us. 

108
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,980
- Don't kill him. He's got information we need.  - He killed my wife!

109
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,830
- Tony, please, don't kill him.  - Move aside. 

110
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,910
I don't want to shoot you, but I will. Move it!

111
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,550
You remember me?

112
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,010
My name is Tony Almeida. 

113
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,010
You killed my wife, Michelle Dessler, this morning. 

114
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,550
He's gonna kill him. Hurry. Hurry!

115
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,560
She was my life, and you took her. 

116
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,940
And now I'm gonna take yours. 

117
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,650
- I got it.  - Tony, I've got you on the security feed. 

118
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,690
- Stay out of this, Jack.  - Please, just listen to me. 

119
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,940
You can't do this. 

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,740
I know how you feel right now. 

121
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,790
I lost Teri the exact same way, to one of our own. 

122
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,170
I know what it feels to be betrayed like this. 

123
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,420
But, Tony, Henderson has information that can save thousands and thousands of lives. 

124
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,350
And I know that doesn't make you feel better right now, but I know you, Tony. 

125
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,640
I know you don't want to make this situation any worse than it is. 

126
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,730
Please. 

127
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,430
Please just let us finish our interrogation. 

128
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,870
Hurry up. 

129
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,950
Agent Burke, please continue. When Henderson starts talking, 

130
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,800
focus on how to find the Sentox canisters and how we can find Bierko. 

131
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,550
Tell me where to find Bierko. 

132
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,140
Where?

133
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,400
Nowhere. 

134
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,610
What is your computer password?

135
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,780
No. 

136
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,610
No password. 

137
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,740
- Agent Burke, can we increase the dose?  - Not without killing him. 

138
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,460
Take a break then start again. Get back to me when you've got anything. 

139
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,620
Yes, sir. 

140
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,590
- How could CTU be hit?  - We're not sure, Mr Vice President. 

141
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,430
Are you telling me they didn't have any safeguards?

142
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,390
They had partial containment, but reports indicate

143
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,560
that 40% % of their personnel have been taken out. 

144
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,590
- You mean, they've been killed.  - I'm afraid so, sir. 

145
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,400
CTU is protecting this city. Are you saying they're no longer capable of doing that?

146
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,940
They've been seriously compromised, yes. 

147
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,660
What are we going to do? We've got terrorists with nerve gas out there. Who will stop them?

148
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,120
- I suggest an emergency restructuring.  - Meaning what?

149
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,960
The Chemical Response Team will go in, neutralise the gas at CTU, 

150
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,420
and I will take a team in there and personally manage the operation. 

151
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,880
- How soon can you do that?  - Within the hour. 

152
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,300
- Fine. Do it.  - Yes, sir. 

153
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,680
All right. We're operational. It's not a complete disaster. 

154
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,340
Mr President, it is. 

155
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
I can see no other option but to impose martial law on the city of Los Angeles. 

156
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,230
My advisors believe if the military takes over and detains people, it could create mayhem. 

157
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,490
It's only a matter of time before more canisters are released in public places

158
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,240
and you will have mayhem, except without soldiers to contain it. 

159
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,290
What do I tell the public? We've got nerve gas all over the city, but we don't know where they are?

160
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,750
You don't have to get into that. Tie it to that earlier incident at the airport. 

161
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,380
- I'm going to get resistance from all sides.  - That's true, sir. 

162
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,420
We may have to swallow some saltwater, but wouldn't it be worth it?

163
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,970
If we can keep the people off the streets, safe from another public attack?

164
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,480
- I don't know, Hal.  - Sir, consider this. 

165
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,650
If we clear the streets of everybody except the military, 

166
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,280
these terrorists won't be able to move as freely as they are now. 

167
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,440
We have to do whatever we can to stop the people behind this. 

168
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,080
CTU is no longer an obstacle, at least for the time being. 

169
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,210
Good. Have our men move from their current positions and go to the new target. 

170
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,590
How much of the nerve gas will they release there?

171
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,760
All of it. 

172
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,330
Excuse me. 

173
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,510
- Chloe, are you ready to go back to work?  - What do you need?

174
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:15,180
You. We can't break Henderson. I need you to try to decrypt the files from his computer. 

175
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,100
I tried. It didn't work. Maybe somebody else can do it. 

176
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,030
Chloe, you're the only person in the room qualified. 

177
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,820
Chloe, please. Don't shut down on me now. 

178
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,580
I'm upset about everything too, but you know how it works. We do not quit until it's over. 

179
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,660
You're not helping her. You're just making things worse. 

180
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,380
I am sure that you are qualified to help someone through distress

181
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,050
over an extended period of time, but we do not have an extended period of time. 

182
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,800
If you don't mind stepping aside so I can do my job, I'd appreciate it. 

183
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,890
You don't have to be qualified to help people, you just have to be there. 

184
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,270
Like you were there for my daughter. 

185
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,730
What does that mean?

186
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,070
You're 20 years older than she is. I know what you're doing. 

187
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,570
I've done nothing but try and help her. How dare you accuse me of taking advantage?

188
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,330
You did. 

189
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,120
Dad, you can be angry at me all you want. 

190
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,790
But before I met Barry, I didn't want to live. Do you understand that?

191
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,000
Fine, I'll get back to work. If everyone could just relax. 

192
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,550
Jack, we have a problem. 

193
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,500
What?

194
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,430
Chloe, I just saw the alarm. What's going on?

195
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,980
Pressure indicators in contaminated zones are showing traces of sublimated polymer. 

196
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,360
- What does that mean?  - The nerve gas must be mixed with an acid. 

197
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,070
The acid's breaking down the seal between the rooms. 

198
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,700
- How long till the seal fails completely?  - It's hard to say for sure. 

199
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,830
- Give me an estimate.  - It's deteriorating quickly. 

200
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,130
- 15 minutes, 20 at the most.  - And then what?

201
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,260
Gas permeates the seal and enters the room. Then it's over. 

202
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,010
Get me schematics on all the isolated zones. 

203
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,820
Mr Vice President, with all due respect, I'm not trying to usurp your position. 

204
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:31,030
I'm simply trying to serve the president the best way I can. 

205
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
Yes, sir. 

206
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,790
What was that about?

207
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,620
I was trying to convince Gardner to let me help him draft the president's statement. 

208
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,590
Charles is letting Hal write his statement?

209
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,420
He's insisted. And the president gave him the go-ahead. 

210
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,210
That means Gardner's effectively making policy. You gotta stop him. 

211
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,060
I'm trying. 

212
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,480
But you know the pressure he's under today. He wants all the counsel he can get. 

213
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,650
And Hal's only too eager to help out. 

214
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,980
Of course he's eager. He's got his eye on the Oval Office. 

215
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,690
Anything he can do to speed up Charles's downfall puts him closer to the presidency. 

216
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,400
Martha, 

217
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,950
you have to intervene. 

218
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,370
Hal feeds the president ideas. 

219
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,030
We saw it at the WTO. We saw it in Chicago. 

220
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:26,710
When they work, Hal takes the credit for 'em. When they don't, the president takes the hits. 

221
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,500
- Have you reminded Charles of that?  - I can't. 

222
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,180
Hal's the vice president. I'm just the Chief of Staff. 

223
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,680
You have influence that supersedes any constitutional rank. 

224
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,310
And now's the time to use it. 

225
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,740
- I want to see the statement when it's issued.  - You will. 

226
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,200
I checked the readings from all uncontaminated zones. 

227
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,990
The testing you've been doing in your respective areas is consistent. 

228
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:11,340
The Sentox gas released into the air duct system contains a corrosive agent

229
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,880
that is eating away at the barrier seals protecting safe zones. 

230
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,550
I'm not gonna pull any punches.  CRT will not be here in time to help us. 

231
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,320
At this point, our only hope is to help ourselves. 

232
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,020
We need to find a way to either neutralise or flush the Sentox out of contaminated areas

233
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,440
before the barrier seals fail, and the gas enters the safe zones. 

234
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,160
I want all personnel working on this problem.  We don't have much time. 

235
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,650
Do what you can. 

236
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,490
We'll hope for the best. 

237
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,830
Maybe we can do something. Access the ventilation system. 

238
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,080
Even if I could, it doesn't mean we could do anything. 

239
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,250
Just try. 

240
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,140
Maybe it's not so bad. Maybe the numbers are off. 

241
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,720
They're not. 

242
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,470
Even if the seals leak, CRT could get here in time. 

243
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,980
The only reason she's here is because I asked her to stay. 

244
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,940
If something happens to her, it's going to be because of what I did. 

245
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,990
There is no way you could know that CTU was vulnerable. 

246
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,240
Jack. 

247
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,740
Have you got something?

248
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,200
If I slow the seals' breakdown, I can flush the area using the air conditioning. 

249
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,370
Do it. 

250
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,920
- Something's wrong. It isn't responding.  - Why not?

251
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,680
It's being blocked by some program I can't get to, 

252
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,220
probably on a computer near holding four. 

253
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,470
- Can you get me in there?  - This is a false wall. The air in there is clean. 

254
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,010
- Can he get to the computer?  - Yes. 

255
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,140
But after the safe zone, he'll be in a contaminated area. 

256
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,800
What? He can't go through a contaminated area. 

257
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,730
I can hold my breath. Sentox won't be absorbed over that short a time. 

258
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,360
- I'll be fine.  - You can't hold your breath that long. 

259
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,830
I only have to get to the computer, disconnect the program and get to the ventilated room. 

260
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,910
Once I'm back, how long will it take to clear the Sentox?

261
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,250
About 20 seconds, based on the cubic footage. 

262
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,010
- Jack, what if we can't ventilate that room?  - Chloe thinks we can. This is our only option. 

263
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,510
- CRT is not gonna get here in time.  - The seals are now 80% % gone. 

264
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,810
- What's the bottom line?  - We have less than 20 minutes. 

265
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,980
We are on channel one. If you need anyone else, we'll patch you through. 

266
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,350
As soon as I go through, you have to replace this behind me. 

267
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,360
Jack, it's time. Go now. 

268
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,480
Now. 

269
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,570
Chloe, I just completed the airlock. I'm getting ready to move into the ventilation room. 

270
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,780
I'll tap my comm unit when I'm back in the safe room. 

271
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,110
All right. Jack, if that airlock leaks, we'll all be dead within the next three minutes. 

272
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,170
It's not gonna leak, Chloe. 

273
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,210
OK. 

274
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,090
- I'm going in.  - OK. 

275
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,850
- The seal corrosion is now at 86%.  - Is there anything we can do here?

276
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,540
Just wait. There's nothing we can do to get your dad out any faster. 

277
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:28,120
- Don't talk down to me, Chloe.  - Listen, we're in a crisis situation here, OK?

278
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,080
Tempers are bound to flare. Just everybody breathe. 

279
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,330
What's with you and the breathing? Is that your solution to everything?

280
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,130
- He's back in the room.  - It's too soon. 

281
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,770
He couldn't have found the program and disabled it yet. 

282
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,770
He's got 15 more seconds before the room clears. 

283
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,650
- What's it mean that he's finished?  - I don't know. 

284
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,570
- It could be good, right?  - It could be good or bad. 

285
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,080
That's what "I don't know" means. 

286
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,120
All right, the room is clear. Are you OK?

287
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,840
I couldn't get to it. Chloe, you're right, I saw it. 

288
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,930
There's a program running on the AC control, but there's a security grate behind the vent. 

289
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,790
- I don't see it on my system.  - Trust me, it's there. 

290
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,730
I just found it. It was a security upgrade in the last two years. 

291
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,690
Somebody didn't file it properly so I didn't see it. 

292
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,900
Are there other vents into that wall?

293
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,150
- They've all been upgraded.  - There's gotta be a door. Where does it lead?

294
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,660
To a corridor above holding four. None of us can get there. 

295
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,420
- Who's in holding room four?  - Lynn McGill. 

296
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,070
Are there any vented rooms we can get him to?

297
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,500
No, Jack. There's nothing. 

298
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,550
Patch me through to him. 

299
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,510
- McGill here.  - Lynn, it's Jack. 

300
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,350
We found a computer interrupt in the AC control. 

301
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,060
If we shut that down in the next few minutes, we can stop the gas permeating safe zones. 

302
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,150
Well, that's good news. 

303
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,280
The problem is, you're the only person close enough to get to it. Chloe?

304
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,570
It's above the room where you are now. 

305
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,350
Take the stairs, go around the corner, it's the room on your left. 

306
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,490
OK. How are we gonna do this, Jack?

307
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,650
Lynn, the truth is if I could get there, I would do this myself, but I'm not close enough. 

308
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,040
No one still alive is. You're the only person who can do this. 

309
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,460
But you have to do it without protection. 

310
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,550
- I see.  - No, you don't. 

311
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,470
As soon as you open the door, your room will become contaminated. 

312
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,140
You can hold your breath long enough to fix the problem, but we can't airlock you. 

313
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,770
There are two of us in here, Jack. 

314
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,770
Sir, this is Harry Swinton. 

315
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,650
So you're saying that if he does this, then we're both gonna die?

316
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,030
I'm so sorry. 

317
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,410
We don't have a choice, Harry. 

318
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,160
How do we know that you're not making this up so you don't have to sacrifice yourself?

319
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,830
You don't. All I can ask you to do is believe me. I'm telling you the truth. 

320
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,920
That's easy for you to say, sir. You're not about to die. 

321
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,920
It's not easy for me to say. 

322
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,550
Hold on. 

323
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:34,480
We have to do this, Harry. We're gonna die anyway. If we don't, so will everyone in CTU. 

324
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,400
We have to do this. 

325
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,150
OK, Jack. Go ahead. 

326
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,490
Once you get into the ventilation room, the computer will be on your right. 

327
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,500
There's a program running on the computer. You need to quit out of it. 

328
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,670
Lynn, we don't have a lot of time. 

329
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,090
I'll do it. 

330
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,250
Chloe, 

331
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm sorry about how I acted earlier, and about your friend that died. 

332
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,460
OK. 

333
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,720
- Thanks.  - I've been wanting to ask you something. 

334
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,260
Did you have contact with my dad while he was gone?

335
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,190
- I sent him information about once a month.  - What kind of information?

336
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,230
- A lot of different things.  - About me?

337
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,930
Actually, almost all of it was about you. Your break-up with Chase, your depression. 

338
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,950
- How did you get... - I'm really good at getting information. 

339
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,660
I don'tjudge it, I just pass it on. 

340
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,410
I'm sorry about you and Chase. It must have been really painful. 

341
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,870
Yeah. It was. 

342
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,080
So you talked to him too?

343
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,500
- Chase? No.  - You know where he is?

344
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,930
- No, but I could find out if you want.  - No, no. It's all right. 

345
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,790
Barry thinks I should let that go. He's probably right. 

346
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:29,430
Yeah, well, shrinks are always giving advice that they probably don't follow themselves. 

347
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:34,270
- How are you doing?  - I woke up with a guy I'll never see again. 

348
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:40,150
And I just watched one of my best friends die right in front of me, so I guess not that great. 

349
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,570
Yeah. 

350
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,550
Replace the panel. Pull up the security feed from the observation room. 

351
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,180
You be a good girl for Mommy, OK?

352
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,690
If she tells you you have to go to bed, you have to go to bed. 

353
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:15,480
- When are you coming home?  - I don't know, honey. 

354
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,940
- If I fall asleep, will you wake me up?  - Of course I will. 

355
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,070
- Yeah?  - Yeah. 

356
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,910
OK. 

357
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,860
I'm going in now, Harry. Say goodbye. 

358
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,040
- I love you.  - I love you too, Daddy. 

359
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,250
Bye, baby girl. 

360
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,250
Chloe, we're ready. I'm going in. 

361
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,970
OK. Good luck. And thanks for doing this. 

362
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,350
Yeah. 

363
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,940
- He did it.  - Is the AC responding?

364
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,360
- Yes.  - How long before the Sentox is neutralised?

365
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,330
At least 15 minutes. But it should stop eating away at the seals immediately. 

366
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,700
Polymer count is down. It looks like the seals will hold until all zones are clear. 

367
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,920
Lynn, Harry, I don't know if you can still hear me, but what you did was successful. 

368
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,340
The seals are holding. 

369
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:13,220
I will personally notify your families and tell them of the sacrifice you made. 

370
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,270
I'm so sorry. 

371
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,600
I don't know what else to say. 

372
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,820
Thank you. 

373
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm OK. 

374
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,540
I'm OK. 

375
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,680
Pull up the security feed to Medical. 

376
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,950
Can you hear me? What's your name?

377
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,990
No. 

378
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,870
No name. 

379
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,630
You're wasting your time. 

380
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,880
It's Jack Bauer.  What have you got from Henderson?

381
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,170
Nothing. He's still not talking. 

382
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:10,500
OK, keep working on him. As soon as the barriers go up I'll get back to you. 

383
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,430
Chloe, I don't think we're gonna break Henderson. 

384
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,810
All we're gonna get is from his computer. Keep working on it. 

385
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,810
- My team is gone. How am I gonna do that?  - Only work on his files. 

386
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:27,400
Kim. As soon as the barriers go up, I want you to go to Medical and let them check you out. 

387
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:32,450
- No. When the barriers go up, I'm leaving.  - Please do this for me. We still need to talk. 

388
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,660
There's nothing to talk about. 

389
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,160
- Don't be in such a hurry to cut me off.  - You cut me off. 

390
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,750
Listen to me, I'm not angry. I love you. 

391
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,210
But there's nothing left to say, except I don't want to be around you. 

392
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:54,720
Every time I am, something horrible happens. People die. 

393
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,810
And I know that's not your fault, 

394
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,970
but I can't be a part of it. 

395
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,440
I don't want you to be a part of that. All I want is for one day, 

396
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,570
you and I just to be able to spend time together. 

397
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,570
Kim, I had to give you up once. I'm not gonna let that happen again. 

398
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,820
Dad...

399
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,370
I can't. 

400
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,540
- Hi.  - Hey. 

401
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,560
God, that was close. 

402
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,690
You all right?

403
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,440
No. 

404
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,670
"An emergency peacekeeping force. "

405
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,380
That was Hal's suggestion. I think it works. 

406
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,260
Charles, aren't you afraid an edict of this kind

407
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,760
could do far more damage than any chemical weapon ever could?

408
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,770
Martha, CTU has been attacked. Our first line of defence is shut down. 

409
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,100
People were killed because of this weapon. That's just a prelude to what's gonna happen. 

410
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,480
More nerve gas will be released. I can guarantee it. 

411
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,900
Look, if you or Mike have any better ideas, please. 

412
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,450
I would be glad to hear them. 

413
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,290
- Mike, could we have a moment?  - Certainly. 

414
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,970
What is it, Martha?

415
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,060
If you, Charles Logan, 

416
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:07,190
really feel that martial law is your only option, I will support you. 

417
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,770
But what I will not do is stand by

418
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,490
and watch Hal Gardner use you to promote his own agenda. 

419
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,780
- Please, give me some credit.  - He has done it before. 

420
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,490
He is not the president. You are. 

421
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,360
I'm doing this because it's the right thing to do. 

422
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,130
I don't know how much more of this I can take. 

423
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,470
I really don't. 

424
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,520
David's assassination, the nerve gas, the murder of those hostages, 

425
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,440
Walt Cummings' betrayal...

426
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,900
And you. 

427
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,820
I almost lost you. 

428
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,950
I didn't lose you, did I?

429
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,500
No, Charles. 

430
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,640
You didn't lose me. 

431
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,810
I'm still here. 

432
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,900
- Yes.  - We're set in position. 

433
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,570
Good. 

434
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,240
The men are there. They need the schematics. 

435
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,800
Who is it?

436
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,370
Just a client. 

437
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,180
- Yes?  - Have you got it yet?

438
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,520
I told you I'd call you as soon as I have everything. I'm still waiting on a few items. 

439
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,730
I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette. 

440
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,400
If you could've got the specs of a facility this secure from someone else, you would have. 

441
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,410
But you didn't. You called me, and I'll have it for you in a few minutes. 

442
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,450
- What's wrong?  - Nothing. 

443
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,580
Difficult client. 

444
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,500
I wish I knew exactly what it is you did. I might be able to help. 

445
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,920
You do help me. 

446
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,730
Oh... I can't. 

447
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,970
I have to go and finish something. 

448
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,050
Finish this. 

449
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,860
- How long until the air's safe?  - Momentarily. 

450
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,950
All right, thank you very much. 

451
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,570
Buchanan. 

452
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,410
- Karen Hayes from Homeland Security.  - Karen. 

453
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
I'm running a damage assessment. I need your body count. 

454
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,790
We don't have one yet. We'll know more when CRT gets here and the barriers lift. 

455
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,170
What's your best estimate?

456
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,760
I'm guessing we'll need at least 20 in Comm, 35 in Tactical and other departments. 

457
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:26,300
I'm on my way over there with a core team. We can make adjustments when I get there. 

458
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,930
- You're coming here now?  - Yes. 

459
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,600
- I see.  - I'll be there soon. 

460
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,190
- How's your progress?  - Good. I've reformatted their main servers. 

461
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,030
All tactical protocols will have to go through me. 

462
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,860
I may have to replace some personnel with my people. Is that a problem?

463
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,780
Absolutely not. After what they've been through, most won't be up to full capacity. 

464
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,250
We need to identify these people quickly and send them home. 

465
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,200
Will I need approval from Bill Buchanan to make a personnel change?

466
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,250
No, Bill won't be in charge when we get there. 

467
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,130
I will. 

468
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:06,460
For all intents and purposes, CTU is no longer an operational entity. 

469
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,720
It's a building with workers who will report to us. 

470
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,150
We're clear. I'm going back to Medical. 

471
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,360
Kim. 

472
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,610
- I have to finish this now.  - I know. 

473
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,160
Goodbye, Dad. 

474
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,190
Yeah. 

475
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,040
Goodbye. 

476
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,960
Excuse me, Jack. 

477
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,840
I just wanted to say thank you for saving our lives. 

478
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,470
We definitely couldn't have gotten through this without you. 

479
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,680
Take her outside of this city. Don't make any stops. You understand?

480
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,080
- Looks like he's dead.  - No. His nervous system is shut down. 

481
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,080
- Well, can you wake him up?  - No. 

482
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,260
- Almeida.  - Tony, it's Jack. I'm on my way. 

483
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,890
Yeah, Jack. Henderson's in a coma. He's not coming out of it. 

484
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,720
You've had your chance. He's mine now. 

485
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,140
- Dammit, Tony, just wait until I get there.  - No. I'm done waiting. 

486
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,940
Don't do this. It won't bring back Michelle. 

487
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,940
No. But I'll feel better. 

488
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,940
Trust me, you won't. 

489
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,910
You're probably right. I'll let you know. 

490
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,450
Tony!

491
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,940
Tony! Dammit. 

492
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,960
What'd Jack say?

493
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:03,420
He's on his way here. We'll figure out what to do when he gets here. 

494
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,840
There's nothing to figure out. 

495
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,010
This guy's cooked. 

496
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,580
Tony! Tony!

497
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,080
I... couldn't do it. 

498
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,870
It's all right. It's all right. Come on. Come on. 

499
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,720
Stay with me. Stay with me. 

500
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,670
I need help! Somebody help!

501
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,180
No, no. No. Hang on. 

502
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,550
Hang on. 

503
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,310
She's gone, Jack. 
﻿1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,700
Have you got it yet?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
Told you I'd call you as soon as I have everything.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,100
And if you could've gotten the detailed specs of a facility this secure from someone else, 

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,700
you would've.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,100
CTU is no longer an obstacle.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,400
This facility has been contaminated with Sentox VX1 nerve gas.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,300
- Repeat: This facility has been contaminated.  - Everybody, leave the situation room.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,000
Move! Now!

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Seal it.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Lynn, it's Jack.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,600
We found a computer interrupted in the AC control unit.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,500
Now if we can shut that down in the next few minutes, 

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,000
we can stop the gas from permeating the safe zones.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,400
The problem is you're the only person close enough to get to it.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,700
Lynn, the truth is if I could get there, 

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I would do this myself, 

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,300
but I'm not close enough.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
And I'm going to have to ask you to do it without any protection.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,200
He did it.

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
CTU is protecting, this city.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,900
Are you saying, 

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,500
they're no longer, 

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
capable of doing that? 

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm saying they've been, 

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,600
seriously compromised here.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,900
We've got terrorists with nerve

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
gas canisters out there.

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,800
Who is going to stop them?

30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,300
Mr. President, I suggest an emergency restructuring.

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,100
CTU is no longer an operational entity.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
It's a building with workers who will report to us.

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,400
I can see no other option right now,

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
but to impose martial law on the city of Los Angeles.

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,000
What I will not do is stand by

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,400
and watch Hal Gardner use you to promote his own agenda.

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,000
You killed my wife Michelle Dessler this morning.

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,400
She was my life.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,500
And you took her.

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,300
My god, he's got a gun.

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,500
You can't do this.

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,300
We have to get him talking.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,500
He's our only lead to Bierko and the rest of the Sentox gas canisters.

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
You've had your chance.

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,600
He's mine now.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,500
Tony!

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,500
Jack, I am so sorry.

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
Security find Henderson yet?

49
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,000
No, he got out of the building before the lockdown.

50
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,300
An external cam got a shot of him as he was leaving.

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,300
And the car that he was using was found a block away.

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
But I think that we might've got what we needed from him.

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
What are you talking about?

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,100
Chloe was able to decrypt a file from his computer.

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
She got a name of someone connected to Bierko.

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,000
Who's Collette Stenger?

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
She's an international intelligence broker.

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,100
State secrets, 

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
intellectual property.

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,500
What's her connection to Bierko?

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Interpol claims

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,400
that she and Bierko met at least twice over the last eight months.

63
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,600
And we think she helped broker the deal.

64
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,900
Is she still in Los Angeles?

65
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,800
She gave a name of a hotel to customs.

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,500
But nothing's to say that she's actually there.

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Curtis is prepping a tactical team to try to bring her in.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
Okay. Good work.

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Manning.

70
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,900
Curtis, it's Jack.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,100
When is the tac team leaving?

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,500
- Right now.  - I'm going with you.

73
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,500
All right.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,300
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, 

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,700
members of the press corps...

76
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
just so you're aware, 

77
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,600
there will be no Q&A following the president's statement.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,100
You're having second thoughts?

79
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,200
Putting soldiers on the streets of L.A. , 

80
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,600
This will not be a popular announcement.

81
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,400
Maybe not.

82
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,900
But it's the right move.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,900
Hal, would you excuse us, please?

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Mrs. Logan, the president's about to go on the air.

85
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,900
I'll be brief.

86
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
I would like a moment alone with my husband.

87
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I've made up my mind, Martha.

88
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm not debating this anymore.

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,700
Just listen, listen please.

90
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Mike Novick spoke to someone at CTU.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
They think they have a lead on this man, 

92
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,100
this man Bierko.

93
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,900
They think they may find him before he launches another attack.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,900
CTU was just hit.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,700
40% of their people are either dead or unable to work.

96
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,800
To think that they would be able to stop this attack, 

97
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,000
that's just wishful thinking.

98
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,800
Maybe not.

99
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,300
Bringing the military in is the best way to maintain order.

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,000
The vice president's right about that.

101
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
Of course he is.

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,200
What's that mean?

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,900
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
that he proposed this whole thing to set you up for a fall?

105
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
So he gets the nomination next year.

106
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
That's insane.

107
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,400
Hal's only motivation is what's best for the country.

108
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,500
There's going to be fallout.

109
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Hal knows it.

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,500
And you know it.

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,700
Mr. president

112
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,300
I have to go.

113
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,000
Charles...

114
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,500
Ladies and gentlemen, 

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,700
the president of the united states.

116
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,800
As you all know, 

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,700
America has been hit today by a series of terrorist strikes, 

118
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,300
beginning with the assassination of former president David Palmer

119
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,300
and the murder of innocent americans at Ontario airport, 

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,300
followed by the attempted assassination of Russian president Yuri Suvarov.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,200
These events are being orchestrated by terrorists operating within our borders.

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,100
Our most recent intelligence suggests

123
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,500
that they will strike again and soon.

124
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,600
I can and will do my sworn duty to ensure the safety of the American people.

125
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,800
Therefore I am issuing an executive order imposing a curfew

126
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,500
on all civilians in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

127
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
This curfew will be effective immediately

128
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,800
and will be enforced by the military.

129
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,600
As disruptive and distasteful as I know this is for many of you, 

130
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,100
I would ask that you remember that we are at war.

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,100
Bracing ourselves against future attacks...

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,600
D.O.D. is asking for a list of our casualties.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,300
I don't want any names released

134
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
until the next of kin have been notified.

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,700
Let me know when that happens.

136
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,000
This place is a sinking ship.

137
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
We should be taking over now, 

138
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,500
not going through the charade of an assessment.

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,700
Until we're ready to transition, 

140
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,600
we need everyone here functioning.

141
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,300
Once the remaining canisters of the nerve gas have been found

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
and the terrorists captured, 

143
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
then we'll assume full control.

144
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,300
Karen.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,700
Hello, Bill.

146
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,900
Bill Buchanan, Miles Papazian from my office.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,900
I appreciate your coming, 

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,100
but that wasn't necessary.

149
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,800
We just need to replace some key personnel.

150
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,700
We're all sorry about the loss of lives here, 

151
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
but the White House feels you may need more than that.

152
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,400
They want an assessment of how Homeland may best assist CTU.

153
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
I'll brief you in my office.

154
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,900
Fine.

155
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,500
Miles, familiarize yourself with the networks, 

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
and then start the survey.

157
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,800
- Let's go.  - Upstairs.

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Chloe O'brian?

159
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,600
Who are you?

160
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,900
Homeland Security.

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,700
I asked your name, 

162
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,700
not who you work for.

163
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,500
I need a vacant station set up.

164
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm kind of busy right now.

165
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm seeing Edgar Stiles listed on my report as a casualty.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,700
Is that right?

167
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,300
Yeah.

168
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,400
Then his station should be available.

169
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
I'll set up over there.

170
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,100
I'll be reinstalling operating protocols for everyone in your group, 

171
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
so I'll need your keycard.

172
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,000
No.

173
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,200
I'm sorry?

174
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,700
You can't have my keycard.

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,100
We're here with a priority admin directive.

176
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
You can confirm that with your supervisor on your own time.

177
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
We're live in Los Angeles, 

178
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,900
where just a few minutes ago, 

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
army units stationed in L.A. County

180
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,800
began moving in force across city limits.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,100
This is the first time a military presence of this scale

182
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,300
has been activated in a major metropolitan area.

183
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,700
While White House officials have stopped short of officially declaring full-scale martial law...

184
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,400
where are you going?

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,100
I just need some fresh air.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,700
These mobile army divisions were activated shortly after

187
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,200
the president's press conference in which he declared an enforced curfew.

188
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,900
I do not trust him.

189
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,200
Ma'am?

190
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,300
The vice president.

191
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,700
This is Aaron Pierce.

192
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,100
Aaron, it's Wayne Palmer.

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,700
Sir, I am so sorry about president Palmer, 

194
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,400
more sorry than I can describe.

195
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,800
Aaron, I know how close you were to my brother.

196
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,800
You must have known he felt the same way about you.

197
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,800
Thank you for saying that.

198
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,000
Actually, Aaron, he's the reason I'm calling.

199
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
There's something from my brother

200
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,000
I need to give you personally.

201
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800
I should be there within the hour.

202
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,000
You're coming here?

203
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,500
Yeah, I know it sounds impulsive, Aaron.

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
But I'd rather see you sooner than later.

205
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,800
There's a curfew in effect, sir.

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,500
I know, I know.

207
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,900
I left before it was declared.

208
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,000
If I may say so, 

209
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,100
this is an odd request.

210
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,900
Aaron, my brother trusted you with his life.

211
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
I am asking you to trust me.

212
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,900
All right.

213
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,200
I'd also appreciate it if you would keep this between us.

214
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,500
I'm hoping there's somewhere we can meet discreetly.

215
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,300
I'll find a place.

216
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,100
Thank you, Aaron.

217
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,600
I'll call you when I'm close.

218
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,100
The effects of this action will no doubt ripple across the country, 

219
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
as other cities begin to take note.

220
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,600
So while legislators debate the legality of president Logan's action, 

221
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,100
martial law is already a fact...

222
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,800
Mike, turn it off.

223
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,500
On the ground, 

224
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,800
here in Los Angeles.

225
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,500
"debate the legality of president Logan's action."

226
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,500
Did you hear that?

227
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,800
They're talking about this like it's an illegal action.

228
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,600
Don't worry, Mr. President.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm in control of the situation.

230
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,300
Our legal people are working on it right now.

231
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,900
Do we have anything more from CTU?

232
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,900
They're still following up on this Bierko lead.

233
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,800
As soon as they have something to report, 

234
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,700
we'll be the first to hear.

235
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,500
Give me details of the current threat assessment.

236
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,300
There's a high probability

237
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,600
that Bierko is planning an attack on a much larger scale

238
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,100
than anything we've seen today.

239
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,200
That's why he targeted CTU...

240
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,700
To cripple our ability to stop him.

241
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,200
And the question is: Was he successful?

242
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
When you look at the numbers, 

243
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,800
you were harder hit than you thought, Bill.

244
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,600
We're still functioning.

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
Maybe not at a 100%, 

246
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,600
but when you install the people I've asked for...

247
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
we'll be back to fighting strength.

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,700
Have you made any progress finding Bierko?

249
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,500
We've identified a woman

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,900
we believe might lead us to him.

251
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,200
Collette Stenger.

252
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,400
We've just sent a tac team to bring her in.

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,500
Good.

254
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
I enjoy watching you get dressed

255
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,800
almost as much as I enjoy watching you get undressed.

256
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,600
You should get dressed yourself

257
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,000
and send the bags down.

258
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,500
This deal you're working on, 

259
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,100
I hope you're getting a lot of money for it.

260
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I never talk about my business, 

261
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,000
you know that.

262
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,600
I know...

263
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,400
but Maria called about this villa in Positano.

264
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,800
She said when you see it, 

265
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,800
you'll love it.

266
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,600
We'll call her later.

267
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I'll see you at the airport, okay?

268
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
In 45 minutes.

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,800
I'll be there.

270
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,200
Yes.

271
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,700
I'm on my way.

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,600
And you have everything I asked for?

273
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,600
Of course.

274
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,400
Good.

275
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Do you have the money?

276
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,000
As soon as I verify the merchandise, 

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,600
I'll have it transferred to your account.

278
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I'll be there soon.

279
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,800
Does she have the schematics and the access codes?

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,600
Yes.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,300
Everything we need.

282
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,300
This distribution center is a difficult target.

283
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,000
It would be much easier to hit a less secure location.

284
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
No, Mikhail, this is the place.

285
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Release the Sentox here...

286
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
and 200, 000 people die.

287
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,200
And we need a second satellite repositioned as soon as possible.

288
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,500
Good. Thank you.

289
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,000
I saw a request for proficiency evaluations

290
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,500
for all CTU personnel on my secondary screen.

291
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,000
That's a formality.

292
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,400
The fact is, we don't have time for evaluations right now.

293
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,700
Then why was it put in the pipeline?

294
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,200
Like I said, it's a formality.

295
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
You're here to shut this place down, aren't you?

296
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,000
And the evaluations will be filled in later as a matter of protocol.

297
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,900
I told you before, 

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,200
- the White House...  - I know what you told me before.

299
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,000
Now tell me the truth.

300
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
The truth is, CTU is being absorbed by Homeland.

301
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,600
Which means, from now on, 

302
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,200
every operational decision needs to go through me.

303
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,400
Bill, what did you expect?

304
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,600
You've been infiltrated.

305
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,500
56 of your people have been killed.

306
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,800
- The others are demoralized...  - they're not demoralized, 

307
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,600
They're angry!

308
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,400
They want to fight back.

309
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
They're willing to lay down their lives.

310
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,700
- Some already have...  - It's done, Bill.

311
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,900
The decision's been made.

312
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,200
And I know neither one of us wants this transition to interfere with ongoing protocol, 

313
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,900
so let's just keep it between us.

314
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,500
At least until this crisis plays out.

315
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,100
There.

316
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,800
Bill?

317
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Homeland is being overly aggressive with their survey.

318
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
What is going on?

319
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,300
Nothing.

320
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,100
It's just a formality.

321
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,400
They'll be gone as soon as they finish their evaluation.

322
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,700
Where are we on the military mobilization?

323
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,300
Martial law is in effect in nine of the 15 L.A. Districts.

324
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm setting up checkpoints for the rest of the county now.

325
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,800
I hope the president's doing the right thing.

326
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,800
Alpha team, 

327
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,800
we're approaching Collette Stenger's apartment

328
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,900
and we're ready to move.

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,700
Are you in position?

330
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,500
Affirmative. We've got the lobby covered.

331
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,200
All right, Copy.

332
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
I think she went for the roof.

333
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,400
Cover the stairs.

334
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,300
Let's go.

335
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,000
We're going up top.

336
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,000
Drop the gun!

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Stand down or he dies!

338
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,800
I said stand down!

339
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,100
Our people are all around you.

340
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,700
They will drop you before you could pull that trigger.

341
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,000
Put the gun down!

342
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,200
What do you mean, "your people"?

343
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,000
Who are you?

344
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,600
Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.

345
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
Show me identification.

346
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm with the German federal intelligence service.

347
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,300
My name's Theo Stoller.

348
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
What are you doing in this country?

349
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
I'm here on special assignment...

350
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,000
by agreement between our governments.

351
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,000
Now you can get the hell out of here

352
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,300
before you destroy my cover.

353
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,700
That's not going to happen.

354
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,300
O'brian.

355
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,100
Chloe, it's Jack.

356
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,800
I want you to check on a foreign agent on the SA list.

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
"Theo Stoller"

358
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,100
Okay.

359
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,100
Got it:

360
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,000
"Theo Stoller, 

361
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
height, 5'11" , 

362
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,600
brown hair, brown eyes."

363
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,600
He's a German operative, 

364
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,900
but trained in England at MI-6.

365
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
There's even contact information:

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,100
- Cell phone...  - That's all right, Chloe.

367
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,000
That's enough, thanks.

368
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,100
I told you, 

369
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,600
you have to get out of here now.

370
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,600
We can't do that.

371
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,100
You were with Collette Stenger.

372
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,100
We need her to help us find Vladimir Bierko.

373
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,100
I don't know him.

374
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,200
Bierko's responsible for the terrorist attacks

375
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,700
that took place in the city earlier today.

376
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,800
He's preparing to mount another one as we speak.

377
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Collette Stenger is the only way we can find him.

378
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,900
Where is she?

379
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,300
I can't help you.

380
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,300
Why not?

381
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Giving you Collette jeopardizes my operation.

382
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,100
What operation?

383
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,700
I've been undercover for the last six months gathering intel on Collette's clientele.

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We've identified cells in three countries, 

385
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,500
but she's connected to a dozen more.

386
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,500
She's too valuable to give up.

387
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
If we don't find Bierko, 

388
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,100
hundreds of thousands of innocent people will die here today.

389
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,800
That is more important than your preemptive operation.

390
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,400
It's not a question of importance.

391
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
It's a question of different agendas.

392
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,100
Your job is to save American lives.

393
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,100
Mine to save German lives.

394
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,100
You're asking me to betray my duty to my country.

395
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,100
Ask yourself what you would do in my position.

396
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,900
You better start asking yourself

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,200
what you would do in mine.

398
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,200
Now, let's go.

399
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm here by permission of your government.

400
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,300
You can't touch me.

401
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,600
Right.

402
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,800
We'll see about that.

403
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,360
Well, make sure that your superior understands that if this attack happens, 

404
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,920
my government will hold your country accountable.

405
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,730
Jack, it's Buchanan. Audrey will be joining us momentarily.

406
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,250
You're also on the line with Karen Hayes from Homeland Security.

407
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,620
She's been providing support to CTU

408
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,330
and she's also been in contact with the White House.

409
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,950
Did President Logan get in touch with the German Chancellor?

410
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,600
He's tried, the Chancellor's unreachable for another hour.

411
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,090
We don't have another hour.

412
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,280
They're stalling, there's nothing we can do about that.

413
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,970
Jack, this is Audrey. I was just speaking with German intelligence.

414
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,810
They're refusing to order their agent to cooperate with us.

415
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,660
Maybe you can get a deal with him.

416
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,580
Okay, I'll talk to Stoller again.

417
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,360
Good, call me if you get him to change his mind.

418
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,900
Curtis?

419
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,770
Let me have a moment with him alone.

420
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,140
Jack, what are you doing?

421
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,340
It's all right.

422
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,620
All right. Let's go.

423
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,080
Your intelligence service denied our request for cooperation.

424
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,920
So has your government.

425
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,510
I'm not surprised.

426
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,960
Collette Stenger is a golden goose.

427
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,290
There's no upside in giving her up.

428
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,300
Maybe I could provide you with one.

429
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,980
Meaning?

430
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,250
I will give you something that is more valuable than Collette Stenger.

431
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,010
It's hard to know what that might be.

432
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:10,300
Our roster of all known terror suspects working around the world, our wet list.

433
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:15,840
As allies, we've requested this wet list many times before.

434
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,750
But the NSA has always said

435
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,570
giving us the list would jeopardize their operations.

436
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,390
It will, I don't work for the NSA, I don't work for CTU.

437
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,100
This is personal and right now, you're not giving me another choice.

438
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:37,380
All right, I'll give you Collette in exchange for the wet list.

439
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,570
Okay, let's see what we can do.

440
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,740
Agent Bauer.

441
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,640
I'm aware of several names that should be on that list.

442
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,020
Don't try and pass me a fake.

443
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,100
O'brian.

444
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,370
Chloe, it's Jack.

445
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,230
Do we still have a back door into NSA's secured mainframe?

446
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,540
I can't really talk right now, Jack.

447
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,830
Okay, fine, then, listen.

448
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,480
I need you to log on to their server, download the wet list

449
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,230
and send it to my PDA immediately.

450
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,230
Why?

451
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,490
The wet list is what we're gonna have to pay to get Collette Stenger.

452
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,330
Jack, that list is as top secret as it gets.

453
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,110
Homeland Security sent a team over here.

454
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,470
You're gonna have to clear it with them.

455
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,590
We can't afford to take the chance of them saying no.

456
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,850
I'm not saying I won't do it without their approval, I'm saying I can't.

457
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,540
They took my keycard, I can't get into the NSA mainframe without it.

458
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,200
Just do what you have to. It's our only way to get Bierko.

459
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,300
Fine, I'll call you back.

460
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,880
Excuse me, Miles.

461
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,990
- Oh, my god!  - What is the matter with you?

462
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,430
Sorry.

463
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,760
What's wrong with you?

464
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,110
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

465
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,200
Jack, I got on the NSA server.

466
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,370
Did you get the file?

467
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,030
Not yet, they put an extra layer of authentication in place.

468
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,280
Can you get around it?

469
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,010
Hold on.

470
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,640
Okay, I got it.

471
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,480
I hope you know what you're doing, I'm uploading it now.

472
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,760
Thanks.

473
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,870
I got it.

474
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,050
Well, that appears legitimate.

475
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,720
It is.

476
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,880
Give me back the memory card.

477
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,200
You can't upload the wet list to your people until I have Collette Stenger in custody.

478
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,800
Well, fair enough.

479
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
We have to go now.

480
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,850
I'm supposed to meet her at the Van Nuys Airport in less than 20 minutes.

481
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,060
What kind of a car is she driving?

482
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,740
I don't know, I'm supposed to park in car lot c and wait for her.

483
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,100
She'll probably recon the area before she makes contact.

484
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,230
She's, uh, cautious by habit.

485
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,040
Curtis, we're on the move Van Nuys Airport, we'll give you the details when we're on the way.

486
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,030
When you receive the funds, transfer them immediately into the Caymans account.

487
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,060
In which account?

488
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,500
In Euros.

489
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,330
One moment to enter the rome.

490
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,390
My bank is ready to accept the transfer.

491
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,260
The file is encrypted.

492
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,220
What is the decryption key?

493
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,100
Transfer the funds.

494
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,670
It's been sent.

495
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:52,110
Thank you, e-mail me confirmation of the transfer.

496
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:09,220
The decryption key is charlie alpha three nine alpha.

497
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,020
It worked, this is what you wanted.

498
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,830
Of course it is.

499
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,590
Until next time, gentlemen.

500
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,330
Are the men ready?

501
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,470
Yes.

502
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,300
Torch this place, we're moving out.

503
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,330
Governor, I'm not trying to coopt your authority, 

504
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,870
but we are in the middle of a crisis here.

505
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,630
Now, you can either transmit my orders word for word to the National Guard

506
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,460
or I can federalize them and give them my orders directly, your choice.

507
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,770
Excellent, thank you, Governor, I look forward to your cooperation.

508
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,090
Sir, we have a situation at one of the roadblocks

509
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,140
that the region three commander needs your call on.

510
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:08,960
Tell me.

511
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,650
Wayne Palmer is insisting he be let through one of our roadblocks.

512
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,380
He claims he still has his clearance and that he's on official business.

513
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,590
And where exactly is that?

514
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,070
He was stopped trying to get on the access road coming towards the retreat.

515
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,820
He's on his way here? To do what?

516
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,700
He wouldn't give the officer in charge of the roadblock any information at first.

517
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,080
What should I tell the roadblock, sir?

518
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,050
Captain, all I'm asking you to do is call and confirm I have a grade two clearance, that's it.

519
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,880
Sir, regardless of your clearance, 

520
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,130
authorization to let you through must come down through the appropriate chain of command.

521
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,900
And just who would that be, huh, captain?

522
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,500
Who's in charge of the military's role in this?

523
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,960
Riggs.

524
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,450
Understood.

525
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,290
Thank you, sir.

526
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,060
You can go on through now, sir. Let him through.

527
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,330
Thank you, captain.

528
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,880
All teams are in position, Jack.

529
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,870
No one moves in until I confirm that it's her.

530
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,430
Copy that.

531
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,850
Collette won't show herself if she senses anything's wrong.

532
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,760
Make sure he stays hidden.

533
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,900
Don't worry, he will.

534
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,870
What will happen to her? To Collette.

535
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,770
I don't know yet. Why?

536
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,190
Uh, just curious.

537
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,220
You've been in my situation?

538
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,550
I've been undercover for long stretches of time.

539
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,920
And been involved with a woman during that time?

540
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,870
There's no question we are doing

541
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,020
what has to be done

542
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,150
for our countries, 

543
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,380
but sometimes it's harder than others.

544
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,780
Chloe, could you join us in the situation room, please?

545
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,610
Sure.

546
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,530
What's going on?

547
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,020
Why don't you tell us, Miss. O'brian?

548
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,540
I don't know.

549
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,750
We've got you hacking

550
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,420
into a top secret NSA archive.

551
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

552
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,070
I pulled a mirrored archive of your web traffic.

553
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,860
Whatever you took from NSA was uploaded to Jack Bauer's remote node.

554
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,430
Miss. O'brian, tell us exactly

555
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,720
what document you passed to Jack Bauer.

556
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,340
Chloe.

557
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,790
This is going to get much worse

558
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,160
if you force me to have NSA run a back trace.

559
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,490
What is it?

560
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,970
Jack needed the wet list.

561
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,100
What?

562
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,850
Why on earth would you give him that?

563
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,830
Theo Stoller wouldn't lead us to Collette Stenger without it.

564
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,030
Chloe, giving that list

565
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,590
to another intelligence agency could be disastrous.

566
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,850
Years of work could be rendered useless.

567
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,290
Our own agents could be exposed.

568
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,470
Jack needed it, okay?

569
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,710
No! No, it's not okay.

570
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,580
And you expected us to give your agents a chance?

571
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,610
Get me Bauer.

572
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,640
Put it on speaker phone or

573
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,380
I'm getting out of this car.

574
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,120
Fine.

575
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,220
This is Bauer.

576
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,490
Jack, it's Bill.

577
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,380
Karen Hayes is here as well.

578
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,010
If you're with Theo Stoller, 

579
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,400
get some place you can talk privately.

580
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,910
I can't, we're in the middle of an operation.

581
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,610
If I move, I'll jeopardize our position.

582
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,830
Then you'll have to have this conversation in front of him.

583
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,540
Have you given him the wet list yet?

584
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,270
Yes.

585
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,380
Has he given it to German intelligence?

586
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,450
- No.  - Then get it back. Now.

587
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,280
I can't.

588
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,450
If I do that, Stoller won't cooperate

589
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,950
and then we'll lose Collette Stenger.

590
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,180
Bill, will you explain this to her?

591
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,540
It's not his decision.

592
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,790
Retrieve the wet list now

593
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,440
or I will order Agent Manning and his team to do it.

594
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,430
Right now, Collette Stenger is our only connection to Bierko.

595
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,780
If you blow this operation, 

596
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,300
you will be responsible for every life lost

597
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,700
in his next attack.

598
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,300
I don't like to be threatened, Mr. Bauer.

599
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,360
Miss. Hayes, that's not a threat, 

600
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,850
that's a fact.

601
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,470
German intelligence will move preemptively on people

602
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,050
that we have been watching for years.

603
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,310
Our ability to prevent terrorist attacks

604
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,630
will be severely threatened.

605
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,140
Then that's a risk we'll have to take.

606
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,160
Right now, we have to deal with this situation.

607
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,430
It's not your call.

608
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,270
It's not mine, either.

609
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,290
We need authorization from the President.

610
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,660
Then get it.

611
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,710
Jack, one of our forward teams

612
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,430
I.D. a woman fitting Stenger's description driving a red Lexus

613
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,120
making its second circuit around the lot.

614
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,270
This could be her.

615
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,970
We have a possible suspect approaching.

616
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,380
Miss. Hayes, are you telling me that

617
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,840
have to abort this operation?

618
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,800
Yes or no?

619
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,570
Miss. Hayes, this is your call.

620
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,120
You don't know for certain

621
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,800
that this woman will lead us to Bierko.

622
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,040
No, not for certain.

623
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,360
But, right now, she's our only lead.

624
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,480
Are you willing to take this chance?

625
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,790
You've left me no choice.

626
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,010
Proceed.

627
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,110
But you have severely compromised

628
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,470
this situation and I promise you,

629
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,450
there will be repercussions.

630
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,400
Fine.

631
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,520
Are we all right?

632
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,860
We're fine.

633
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,720
Red Lexus turning the corner.

634
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,310
A hundred yards away and approaching.

635
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,090
No one move until I give a go.

636
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,500
The red Lexus is parked.

637
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,060
Move the center mirror.

638
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,420
So that I can see the car.

639
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,510
There.

640
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,760
Now get her out of the car.

641
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,520
Hi.

642
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,630
Hello.

643
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,200
I have a positive I.D.

644
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,090
All teams move in.

645
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,530
All teams move, move, move!

646
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,450
Let's go!

647
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,730
Put your hands where I can see them!

648
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,770
Theo, get in the car, now.

649
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,230
Theo, Let me go, what are you doing?

650
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,330
Let me see your hands!

651
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,300
What are you doing? Now!

652
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,350
Theo, get out of there.

653
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,640
I'm sorry.

654
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,570
Theo, who are you?

655
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:31,710
Move!

656
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,550
Letting him go.

657
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,000
He's given us what we want!

658
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,290
Put your hands up!

659
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,110
Turn and face the car!

660
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,960
Put your hands on the roof!

661
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,870
Do it!

662
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,070
Where is Bierko?

663
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,330
We know you're working with Bierko.

664
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,810
Where is he?

665
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,730
Fine.

666
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,860
Take her back to staging.

667
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,560
I want a team searching this car.

668
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,670
Take everything back to the staging area.

669
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,660
Now!

670
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,220
It's Theo.

671
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,680
I'm enroute to the hotel.

672
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,600
Tell Heinrich,

673
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,640
I'm uploading something he's been wanting for a long time.

674
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,920
Stoller.

675
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,900
Theo, it's Jack.

676
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,070
I'm sorry.

677
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,990
I thought we had a deal.

678
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,270
When this is over, I promise you, 

679
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,190
I will help you rebuild your investigation.

680
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,340
I give you my word.

681
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,990
I had your word.

682
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,590
Now I know what it's worth.

683
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,600
- What have you got?  - Nothing.

684
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,840
She's covered her tracks.

685
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,650
There's no sign of what she sold to Bierko.

686
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,210
Come with me.

687
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,720
Collette Stenger.

688
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,360
My name is Jack Bauer.

689
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,780
Who is Theo really?

690
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,670
German intelligence.

691
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,280
Then he sold me for a price.

692
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,200
German and American intelligence don't work together often.

693
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,450
Where is Bierko?

694
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,080
The fact is, I actually had feelings for Theo.

695
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,200
I never once suspected.

696
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,780
He was very good.

697
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,070
I always thought that there were some things that you cannot fake.

698
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,770
Bierko.

699
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,990
Tell them to leave.

700
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,420
- Jack?  - It's all right.

701
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,530
Curtis, have your men move back. Just give us a second.

702
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,000
Let's go.

703
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,970
Theo had a price. What's yours?

704
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,350
- I'm not for sale.  - Everyone is for sale.

705
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,240
This isn't a game, lady, we're running out of time.

706
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,740
You better tell me what you want.

707
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,980
All right.

708
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,450
Full immunity. No holdbacks.

709
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,940
Signed by your president and transmitted to lawyers in Zurich and Tripoli.

710
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,930
But I can't tell you where Bierko is.

711
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,740
Why not?

712
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,040
Because he's already gone.

713
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,470
I met him at a safehouse, but he was already on his way to carry out the attack.

714
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,120
- What were you selling him?  - I don't know.

715
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,320
What do you mean, you don't know?

716
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,560
I mean I don't know. It was a schematic.

717
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,360
What kind of a schematic?

718
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,170
I'm paid to broker the information, 

719
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,840
not dwell on the details, I make it my firm policy.

720
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,950
You expect me to believe that you acquired information

721
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,440
for a terrorist group and you didn't know the specifics?

722
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,300
You can believe whatever you want.

723
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,750
The fact is, I got the schematics from a source

724
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,620
and they were digitally encrypted.

725
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,860
That source can tell you what they mean.

726
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,510
Give me immunity and I'll give you my source. Those are my terms.

727
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,270
You haven't offered us very much.

728
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,080
I'll see what I can do.

729
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,640
Buchanan.

730
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,920
Yeah, it's Jack.

731
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,830
She wants full immunity signed by the President.

732
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,250
She claims that she doesn't know where Bierko is.

733
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,710
That she just brokered a deal for a set of schematics

734
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,830
and then delivered them.

735
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,420
She doesn't know what building they're for, 

736
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,040
but she can provide us with the source of the schematics.

737
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,470
She doesn't know what she sold him?

738
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,360
She said it was digitally encrypted.

739
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,870
Do you believe her?

740
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,760
She's an independent contractor.

741
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,270
In her line of work, sometimes what you don't know will save your life. Either way, 

742
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,570
if she's telling the truth, we don't have a lot of time.

743
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,630
She said Bierko already left to set off his next attack.

744
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,870
Miles, call Mike Novick, let's get this started.

745
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,970
Jack, this better work.

746
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,700
And for the record, I don't like it.

747
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,500
We've paid a steep price.

748
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,140
There'll be fallout on the wet list.

749
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,980
No, there won't be. The fallout will be from German intelligence.

750
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,180
I programmed the memory card to self destruct.

751
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,720
Why didn't you tell us this before?

752
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,880
I told you, I was in the car with Stoller.

753
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,770
Get back to me as soon as this is done, we need to move fast.

754
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,150
I think it's clear.

755
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,960
CTU was hit, 

756
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,220
but we're still doing our job.

757
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,140
I believe that's an argument to maintain our autonomy.

758
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,990
Well, I'll withhold judgment on that.

759
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,460
We're giving a free pass to a terrorist collaborator

760
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,630
and I have yet to see what we're getting from it.

761
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,010
Has the document been received in Tripoli as well?

762
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,640
And it meets with your approval?

763
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,130
So, there's no way that they can fail to live up to the terms?

764
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,130
Merci, Herve, au revoir.

765
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,930
The safehouse is a manufacturing facility at 12451 saticoy boulevard.

766
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,710
As for the data I sold to Bierko, 

767
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,660
it's something that I received from a contact at the Department of Defense.

768
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,240
What's his name?

769
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,510
Her name.

770
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,640
Audrey Raines.

771
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,770
You are lying to me.

772
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,860
She sold me the information, Mr.Bauer. 

773
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,600
Apparently she had a price.

774
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,430
Put her in the car.

775
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


776
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,060
I'm issuing an executive order, imposing a curfew

2
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,030
on all civilians

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,430
in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,230
This curfew will be effective immediately

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,330
and will be enforced by the military.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,660
They're talking about this

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,000
like it's an illegal action.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,160
Don't worry, Mr. President.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,330
I'm in control of the situation.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,860
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,630
that he proposed this whole thing to set you up for a fall?

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,060
Hal's only motivation is what's best for the country.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,460
There's going to be a fallout.

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,830
And you know it.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,960
You're here to shut this place down, aren't you?

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,130
I told you before, the White House...

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,330
I know what you told me before.

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,800
Now tell me the truth.

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,460
CTU is being absorbed by Homeland,

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,860
which means from now on,

21
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,030
every operational decision needs to go through me.

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,530
There's something from my brother

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,860
I need to give you personally.

24
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,460
I should be there within the hour.

25
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,660
- You coming here?  - I know it sounds impulsive, Aaron,

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,530
but I'd rather see you sooner than later.

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,730
I'm hoping there's somewhere we can meet discreetly.

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,460
Does she have the schematics and the access codes?

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,100
Yes. Everything we need.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,800
Release the Sentox here...

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,700
and 200,000 people die.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,230
The decryption key is Charlie-Alpha-3-9-Alpha.

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,400
It worked.

34
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,730
This is what you wanted.

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,230
Drop the gun!

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,230
I'm with the German Federal Intelligence Service.

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,730
I've been undercover for the last six months,

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,530
gathering intel on Collette's clientele.

39
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,360
If we don't find Bierko,

40
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,000
hundreds of thousands of innocent people

41
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,164
will die here today.

42
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,200
Let him go!

43
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,552
He's given us what we want!

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,430
Put your hands up!

45
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,200
As for the data I sold to Bierko,

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,860
it's something that I received from a contact from the Department of Defense.

47
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,700
- What's his name?  - Her name?

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,430
Audrey Raines.

49
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,900
You were lying to me.

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,200
She sold me the information, Mr. Bauer.

51
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,600
Apparently, she had a price.

52
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,600


53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Chloe, I need you to do something for me right away.

54
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,530
Check out Audrey Raines's

55
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,360
activities in the last 18 months.

56
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,600
Audrey? Why?

57
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,960
I'll explain later.

58
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm particularly interested in any unusual connection

59
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,800
between her and Christopher Henderson or Walt Cummings.

60
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,330
You think she has something to do with their conspiracy?

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,500
I don't know what to think. Please do it quickly.

62
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,430
Audrey.

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,730
Yes.

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,430
I'm afraid I have to take you into custody.

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,160
What? I don't understand.

66
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,360
- Am I being arrested?  - Detained.

67
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,700
On what grounds?

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,100
Collette Stenger's been passing information to Bierko,

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,760
information he apparently intends to use in his next attack.

70
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,400
She claims she got the information

71
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,400
from someone at DOD,

72
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,830
and she named you as the source.

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,260
She's lying. That's impossible.

74
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,430
We already uncovered one mole

75
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,600
in the White House today, Audrey.

76
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,060
I have no choice.

77
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,260
What kind of information did Stenger say I gave her?

78
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,430
I've told you as much as I can at this point.

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,400
Prep Ms. Raines for interrogation.

80
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,730
- Does Jack know that I'm being detained?  - Yes.

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,030
He sanctioned it.

82
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,360
It's the truth.

83
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,300
Audrey Raines was my contact at the Department of Defense.

84
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,700
- You met with her face-to-face?  - Yes.

85
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,530
Good, then you'll be able to recognize her when you see her.

86
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,430
- Of course.  - She identified Ms. Raines

87
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,330
from photographs on the way.

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,230
If you were lying to me,

89
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,760
I'm gonna make this the worst day of your life.

90
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,500
You understand?

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,200
Put her in Holding.

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,530
Burke's interrogation methods

93
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,160
should only be used as a last resort.

94
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,360
The situation warrants a more aggressive approach.

95
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,200
Then do the same thing to Collette Stenger.

96
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,060
Stenger is protected by an immunity agreement.

97
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,530
We can't touch her unless the information

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,830
she's provided turns out to be false;

99
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,160
then we can nullify the agreement.

100
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,000
So we can torture our own people,

101
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,330
but we can't touch a criminal?

102
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,460
I've known Audrey Raines for years.

103
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,830
I trust her implicitly.

104
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,100
So does everyone else.

105
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,400
Maybe that's the problem.

106
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,860
Bill, we don't have the luxury of time.

107
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,200
Intel indicates that an attack is imminent...

108
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,560
within an hour.

109
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,400
Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of Americans

110
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,700
are at risk, and we just got information

111
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,960
that Audrey Raines knows about it.

112
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,660
Karen, the decision is yours.

113
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,700
But any adverse consequences

114
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,960
that result from insufficiently aggressive action taken now

115
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,000
will come down hard on you.

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,100
What is Agent Burke doing here?

117
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:06,008
We're talking about authorizing the medical interrogation.

118
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,760
- On Audrey?  - Yes.

119
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,760
That's ridiculous.

120
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,400
I'll handle the interrogation.

121
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,630
I can't allow that.

122
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,030
Karen, I brought this to you. I called it in.

123
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,400
You can't pull me off of this now.

124
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,860
Your emotional involvement with Ms. Raines

125
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,860
is not exactly a secret, Jack.

126
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,630
That has nothing to do with this.

127
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,400
That's right.

128
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,130
You always put the work first.

129
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,160
You never let your feelings get involved.

130
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,700
Is that what happened with Nina Myers?

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,300
Nina Myers was a mistake... I've never denied that...

132
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,630
but she was deep cover

133
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,900
for years before I even met her.

134
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,660
She fooled a lot of people for a long time, not just me.

135
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,160
Well, maybe Audrey is fooling people, too.

136
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,830
You might be right, Karen, but if I were you,

137
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,200
I would think twice about

138
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,530
who you're willing to invasively interrogate.

139
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,200
Audrey Raines is the senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense,

140
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,460
James Heller, who happens to be her father!

141
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,700
And if you were wrong,

142
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,860
he's gonna eat you alive.

143
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,660
At least let Jack talk to her for ten minutes first.

144
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,700
She deserves that much.

145
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,160
If she's guilty...

146
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,000
she doesn't deserve anything.

147
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,000
That's the point.

148
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,630
She hasn't been proven guilty.

149
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,160
After she's been prepped, you can see her for ten minutes.

150
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,460
But at the first sign you're less than objective,

151
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,100
you're out.

152
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,030
Understood.

153
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,060
Thanks, Bill.

154
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,400
I don't believe Audrey is guilty of anything, Jack.

155
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,630
Neither do I.

156
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,930
The one thing we do know is,

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Bierko is going to release the Sentox

158
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,560
in the city sometime in the next hour.

159
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,960
If Audrey knows anything that can help us find him,

160
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,730
she needs to tell us now.

161
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,860
Keep an eye on the traffic patrol.

162
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,900
Bierko's gonna need to move those canisters.

163
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,100
He's gonna need transportation.

164
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,730
With the curfew in place, I might get lucky

165
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,730
and pick up a trail.

166
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,100
Yeah.

167
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,600
Hey, break it up!

168
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,560
Break it up now!

169
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,700
Gentlemen, I said, break it up!

170
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,100
Take their uniforms and weapons.

171
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,660
Now we have a police escort to the target,

172
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,760
the curfew won't be a problem.

173
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,930
Chloe, walk with me.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,200
You were doing background on Audrey?

175
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,360
Yeah.

176
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,030
What have you got?

177
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,900
You're not going to like it.

178
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,460
I found the connection between Walt Cummings and Audrey.

179
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,630
What kind of a connection?

180
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,030
They dealt with each other a few times...

181
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,900
the usual stuff between DOD and the White House.

182
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,460
But there is something else.

183
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,930
What?

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,800
Chloe, what?

185
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,800
They both stayed at a place called the River Hotel

186
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,430
in Pikesville, Maryland, last April.

187
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,200
So?

188
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,230
So, Pikesville isn't exactly a hot spot

189
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,760
with top-ranking federal officials.

190
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,700
It wasn't a coincidence that they were there the same night.

191
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,630
Chloe, what are you trying to say?

192
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,760
They didn't just stay in the same hotel,

193
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,460
but they stayed in the same room.

194
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,330
How could you possibly know that?

195
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,760
Because I e-mailed photos of them to the manager.

196
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,160
He recognized them both.

197
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,760
He showed me phone bills, room service receipts.

198
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,830
I can show you a few if you want.

199
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,930
No. I'm sorry.

200
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,300
I believe you.

201
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,630
It doesn't mean she was part of their conspiracy,

202
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,330
but it doesn't exactly look that good either.

203
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,360
Make copies of everything you've got

204
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,700
and put them in a folder for me.

205
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,260
- I will.  - Thanks.

206
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,330
Excuse me.

207
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,460
My name is Shari Rothenberg.

208
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,860
I work in Section Five downstairs.

209
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,800
I know where Section Five is.

210
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,430
Right. Uh, Mr. Buchanan told me to report to Chloe O'Brian.

211
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,760
Is that you?

212
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,000
You're gonna have to wait a second.

213
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,130
Um, I'm here to replace Edgar.

214
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
I understand he died in the attack.

215
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,830
Yes, he did.

216
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,200
Well, if he was a friend of yours,

217
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,960
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,900
Thanks.

219
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,600
He worked at Station Six.

220
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,160
It's right there.

221
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,660
Are you familiar

222
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,930
with the Gavilan matrix analyzer?

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes, I am.

224
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,400
Use it to make sure our databases are current.

225
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,200
Some of them may have fallen behind in the past couple of hours.

226
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,130
No problem.

227
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,700
Jack.

228
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
Sit down.

229
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,600
Sit down.

230
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,830
- Have you had your contact with Collette Stenger?  - No.

231
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,960
She says that you provided her with information from the DOD.

232
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,500
I know. Bill told me. That's ridiculous.

233
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,360
You know it.

234
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,500
Jack, you're wasting time that we don't have.

235
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,000
I had to ask CTU

236
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,060
so that I could interrogate you.

237
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,060
I have a job to do. If I don't do it,

238
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,430
Burke will, and I promise you,

239
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,700
you do not want to see him walk through that door.

240
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,960
Fine.

241
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,460
What kind of information did she say I gave her?

242
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,000
She said you provided her with a structural schematic

243
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,030
of Bierko's next target.

244
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,300
What kind of structure?

245
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,830
She didn't know. She just delivered the package.

246
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,400
She claims that I gave her information,

247
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,900
yet she can't tell you

248
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,000
what that information is, and that's enough

249
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,660
to make me a suspect?

250
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:12,872
Damn it, Audrey! You know what this nerve gas does?

251
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,300
They are planning another attack.

252
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,130
We will not ignore any leads.

253
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,230
I have nothing to do with these terrorists.

254
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,360
How did Collette Stenger

255
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,330
get your name?

256
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't know.

257
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,000
My father is the Secretary of Defense.

258
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm an easy target. Maybe she's trying

259
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,930
to use him or embarrass him.

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,130
Is he involved?

261
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,900
Oh, Jack, you know him better than that.

262
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,600
You worked with him.

263
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,860
He would never do anything outside the law,

264
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,030
and neither would I.

265
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,600
The two men that we know are part of the conspiracy

266
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,130
are Walt Cummings and Christopher Henderson.

267
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,860
Have you had any contact with these men?

268
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,230
Christopher Henderson.

269
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,760
I have never heard... I'd never heard of him before today,

270
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,160
and, um...

271
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,560
Walt Cummings, I... I have met a couple of times, yes.

272
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,630
Where?

273
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,960
Um, DOD briefings.

274
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,160
That's it?

275
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,660
Yes.

276
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,960
Are you sure?

277
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,360
Yes, I'm sure.

278
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,260
Open it.

279
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,300
The River Hotel, Pikesville, last April.

280
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,260
Yeah, I'm sorry.

281
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,700
Um... We happened

282
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,130
to be there at the same time.

283
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,960
We may have had a drink or two together.

284
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,400
You weren't having drinks with him.

285
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,100
You shared a room with him. You slept with him.

286
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,860
Yes.

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,160
I was still recovering from losing you, Jack.

288
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,800
He, uh... 

289
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,830
He had just separated from his wife,

290
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,760
and I slept with him once and then I broke it off.

291
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,160
Why'd you break it off?

292
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,630
Jack, please, it's complicated.

293
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,230
Why did you break it off?

294
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,600
Because he wasn't you.

295
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,330
Why did you lie to me

296
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,000
when I asked you the first time?

297
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,900
'Cause I, I was...

298
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,200
I was afraid that you'd think less of me,

299
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,460
that you wouldn't be able to forgive me.

300
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,730
Because you slept with someone after you thought I was dead?

301
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,960
Because I slept with someone

302
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,700
who turned out to be a traitor, Jack.

303
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,460
- Is that the only time you spent with Cummings?  - Yes.

304
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,330
- Did he ever talk to you about a terrorist attack, nerve gas?  - No.

305
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,530
- He ever mention Christopher Henderson?  - No.

306
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,930
Damn it, Audrey!

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,030
Jack, I... Jack!

308
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,060
Tell me the truth!

309
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,060
I am telling you the t... 

310
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,960
You've already lied to me once.

311
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,030
You tell me what you know, or I promise you

312
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,530
this will become very unpleasant.

313
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm telling you everything.

314
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,360
All right.

315
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,630
Do what you have to do.

316
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,900
Damn it, Audrey. Tell me the truth!

317
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,030
Jack. I am telling you the truth, I swear.

318
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,560
This is over!

319
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,530
You understand? This is over!

320
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,530
If you ask me, she broke him

321
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,760
and not the other way around.

322
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,760
Karen.

323
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,460
He didn't push her hard enough,

324
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,630
and you know it. He's protecting her.

325
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,730
She's innocent.

326
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,730
We have to be certain.

327
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I am certain.

328
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,300
Jack is certain.

329
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,230
Well, I'm not.

330
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,260
Karen.

331
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,560
Send Burke in.

332
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,600
I have to do this, Bill. I can't waste

333
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,200
any more time, and make sure that Jack

334
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,430
doesn't interfere.

335
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,500
Okay, I'll pass that on.

336
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,730
Shari. That was the agent at Bierko's safe house.

337
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,600
The place is empty.

338
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,430
Forensics is still looking, but they don't expect to find much.

339
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,430
Upload that information onto the subnets.

340
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,230
Oh. Right.

341
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,830
I checked your file.

342
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,230
You're not qualified for Level Three work,

343
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,500
and that is not a Three.

344
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,730
I'm provisionally qualified.

345
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,460
It's all in my supplemental file.

346
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,930
Go ahead and check it if you want.

347
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,560
All right, Shari.

348
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,100
First mistake, I yank the provisional

349
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,260
and you're out of here.

350
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,730
What's with him?

351
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,430
Two years ago we both worked

352
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,060
in the San Francisco office.

353
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,600
There was a sexual harassment thing.

354
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,830
Miles?

355
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,230
It was subtle at first,

356
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,900
and then it got really bad.

357
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,460
I finally filed a grievance.

358
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,430
What happened?

359
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,160
He got off with a warning.

360
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,600
These things are really hard to prove.

361
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,830
They said we didn't have enough evidence

362
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,960
to go to trial.

363
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,500
I can't get into any details.

364
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,630
The file is sealed.

365
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Don't worry. I don't need details.

366
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,160
But I guess I'd better not make any mistakes.

367
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,030
Yeah.

368
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,530
What's going on?

369
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,530
I'm sorry. This is out of my control.

370
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,900
Karen wants to push Audrey

371
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,100
a little harder.

372
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,830
No, her interrogation is over.

373
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,160
Jack, I'll try to stall her as long as I can.

374
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,730
Jack, I have orders

375
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,260
to take Miss Raines to Holding for further interrogation.

376
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,760
I don't care about your orders. That's not gonna happen.

377
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,630
Get out of my way.

378
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,730
Get out of my way.

379
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,030
Jack, stop it! Jack, don't make this any harder than it is.

380
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,860
Stop it, Jack! Stop it! Jack!

381
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,100
Bill, do something!

382
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,130
Bill! Make them stop!

383
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,130
Bill!

384
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
Bill!

385
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,000
Hello.

386
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,100
Mr. Henderson, it's Brennan.

387
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,600
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

388
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,500
- No.  - Explain.

389
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,460
We rolled his car, but he survived and got away.

390
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,600
It was sloppy work. We'll make it right.

391
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:45,804
Well, you damn well better.

392
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:47,097
You know what's at stake.

393
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,130
Yes, sir.

394
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,360
This is Wayne Palmer.

395
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,430
At the tone, leave a message.

396
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,630
Steve, has Wayne Palmer come through a checkpoint

397
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,100
within the last half hour?

398
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,860
Yeah, he was cleared through Checkpoint 6 30 minutes ago.

399
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,200
What, he's not here yet?

400
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,060
No, he's not, and I can't reach him on his cell.

401
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,530
If you're worried, I can send out an alert.

402
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,830
No.

403
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,930
Actually, he kind of wanted to keep his visit under the radar.

404
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,630
I think I'm going to go out there and take a look myself,

405
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,530
in case he had car trouble or something.

406
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,500
Do me a favor.

407
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,900
Keep this between us, would you?

408
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,900
Yes, sir.

409
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Thanks.

410
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,000
Thanks.

411
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,700
You need to calm down, Jack,

412
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,060
and remember who's in charge.

413
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,530
Audrey Raines is innocent.

414
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,360
She slept with a known conspirator and lied about it.

415
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,400
That doesn't concern you?

416
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,760
She slept with him once

417
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,230
and lied about it because she was embarrassed.

418
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,260
That hardly makes her

419
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,630
part of this conspiracy.

420
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,560
Why did Collette Stenger name her as the source?

421
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,060
She must have gotten Audrey's name from Henderson.

422
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,130
Why would Henderson want to implicate Audrey?

423
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,660
Henderson doesn't want to implicate Audrey.

424
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,960
He's coming after me.

425
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,360
He's trying to make me lose focus.

426
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,030
And he's trying to pull you off target.

427
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,200
- And he's done it.  - These plans must have been made

428
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,960
some time ago, when Henderson had every reason to believe

429
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,960
you were gonna be killed.

430
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,460
Karen, listen to me.

431
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,130
This is what I do for a living.

432
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,300
And the first rule of engagement

433
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,000
is that you have a contingency plan.

434
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,700
And this is his, and it's working.

435
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,130
You're getting ready to interrogate Audrey Raines

436
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,060
when you should be interrogating Collette Stenger,

437
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,330
because she still has information that we don't have!

438
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
Stenger has immunity.

439
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,860
She's being protected by a federal marshal.

440
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,600
That's your doing, Jack.

441
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,960
You made that deal!

442
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,500
I know.

443
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,130
But if I can prove that Collette Stenger

444
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,600
is withholding information from us,

445
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,400
that act alone

446
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,060
negates her deal.

447
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,800
I'll be able to start questioning her again.

448
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,960
She will give me Henderson.

449
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,600
And once I have Henderson, he will lead us

450
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,030
to the nerve gas, and that's what

451
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,230
we're supposed to be focused on!

452
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,730
What are you suggesting we do, Jack?

453
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,330
Let me and Chloe find proof that Collette Stenger is lying to us.

454
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,260
If we don't, you lose nothing.

455
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,700
But if we do, we can stop this thing from happening,

456
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I promise you.

457
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,630
Karen, please.

458
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,730
Excuse me.

459
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,360
These matrix sweeps

460
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,130
are partials only.

461
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Where's the rest of the data?

462
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,130
I thought matrix data could be sent unfiltered.

463
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,230
That's not protocol.

464
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,760
I thought it was all right in house.

465
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,500
Only if it's authorized.

466
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,500
Who authorized it?

467
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,200
I did.

468
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,660
She did it under my authority.

469
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,800
I take full responsibility.

470
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:36,919
I don't believe you.

471
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,071
Believe what you want.

472
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,410
That would be sloppy, O'Brian.

473
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:43,677
You don't work like that.

474
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,430
She told you about my alleged sexual harassment, right?

475
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,230
- Well, she's lying. Listen...  - No, you listen.

476
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,760
There are 17 canisters of nerve gas about to be deployed somewhere in Los Angeles,

477
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,630
We're trying to find them.

478
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,060
If you interrupt our work one more time,

479
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,200
I'll file a complaint with Division.

480
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,360
Then you'll see what protocol's all about.

481
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,300
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

482
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,960
Chloe, we need to help Audrey. We don't have much time.

483
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,000
- How?  - We need to find the connection

484
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,500
between Collette Stenger and Henderson.

485
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,600
We found Collette's name on Henderson's computer.

486
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,940
It's not enough. We need proof that they had

487
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:39,424
direct contact, preferably more than once.

488
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,300
You think Henderson gave Collette Audrey's name?

489
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,530
I'm sure of it. I want you to use outside agencies,

490
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,530
including foreign. Put it on a priority channel.

491
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,630
I'm on it.

492
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,930


493
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,130
We have an important delivery.

494
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
There's no delivery scheduled.

495
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,630
I'm gonna need to call this in.

496
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,230
Stay out here and watch the perimeter.

497
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,730
Very good. Finish off over there.

498
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,530
Who's in charge?

499
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,106
I am.

500
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,030
We need access to the control room.

501
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:12,001
Can you take us there?

502
00:24:12,092 --> 00:24:13,822
What are you guys doing here?

503
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,200
Can you take us to the control room?

504
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,760
Yeah. It's that way.

505
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,260
Good.

506
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,700
Keep cooperating and no more of your friends will die.

507
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,300
- Do you understand?  - Yes.

508
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,230
Mikhail, take the canisters to the main distribution tank. Quickly!

509
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:30,930
Let's go.

510
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,760
This is it.

511
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,400
Sam, what's going on?

512
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,160
Ah, Sam... I'm not an engineer, but I know enough,

513
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,800
so you'd be wise not to try to deceive me.

514
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,230
What we're doing here is very simple.

515
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
We're going to release a certain substance

516
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,900
so that it flows into your pipelines.

517
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,300
What kind of substance?

518
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,030
That's not your concern. 

519
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,830
But at the pressure which currently prevails in these pipes,

520
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,030
the substance will react chemically with the gas and become inert.

521
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,260
So I need the pressure reduced by about 50%.

522
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,860
Sam, don't do it.

523
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,960
Do you understand what I want?

524
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,930
You want PSI cut by half.

525
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,830
Exactly.

526
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,800
And how long will it take?

527
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,700
It could take an hour.

528
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,460
You don't seem to care very much for your friends, do you, Sam?

529
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,630
No, no, don't!

530
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,330
I might be able to do it in 30 minutes.

531
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,330
You have 15.

532
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,660
Better get started.

533
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,860
Don't move!

534
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,330
Drop the gun. Now!

535
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,500
Move away from it.

536
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,060
Now get on your knees.

537
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,530
Mr. Palmer.

538
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,960
It's Aaron.

539
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,900
Oh, God.

540
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,030
Aaron, what are you doing out here?

541
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,430
I was looking for you, sir.

542
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,530
So are some other people. Let's go.

543
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,760
Ms. Raines, we know you conspired with Mr. Cummings.

544
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,060
I didn't.

545
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,360
Who else in the White House was involved?

546
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,560
I don't know.

547
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,060
You know, Ms. Raines.

548
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,600
I don't have... have any names.

549
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,215
- You're gonna give me a name...  - I swear I don't know, I...

550
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,200
We don't have the time, Ms. Raines.

551
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,960
Give me a name!

552
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,660
I don't... I swear. I don't know.

553
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,830
Chloe, what have you got?

554
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,560
I found some masked entries in Collette Stenger's cell phone.

555
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:40,260
- The decryption program had...  - Come on, Chloe.

556
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,860
Bottom line: Henderson placed eight cell phone calls

557
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,620
to Collette Stenger within the past three months. 

558
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,630
Where's Collette Stenger now?

559
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,164
Holding Room 3.

560
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:48,804
Bill, we have a connection between Hendersonand and Collette Stinger.

561
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,100
He made eight calls to her

562
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,070
that she didn't tell us about. That voids her agreement.

563
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:53,854
- It's off.  - That's for the president to decide.

564
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:56,677
- Call the president!  - You need a rescinding order to question her, Jack.

565
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,171
Get him to back off of Audrey!

566
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:03,077
Get me the president.

567
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,660
What's your connection with Christopher Henderson?

568
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,260
I have an immunity agreement signed by your president.

569
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,230
- She's right. She can't be questioned.  - We have proof that she withheld information. 

570
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,860
Her deal's been rescinded. The order's on its way.

571
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,330
When it gets here, she's all yours.

572
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,900
An innocent woman is being interrogated because of her.

573
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,200
Look, I'm sorry, sir, but you have to go.

574
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:33,829
We know you lied to us.

575
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,379
We know that you did not get the schematics from Audrey Raines.

576
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,880
Henderson told you to use her name in case you got in trouble, right?

577
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:47,078
You do not want to try me.

578
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,630
Yes.

579
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,030
He tells you why?

580
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,800
No.

581
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,630
He's using you.

582
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,430
He wanted you to get inside my head.

583
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:06,052
It worked.

584
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,960
Now I'm... upset.

585
00:29:11,098 --> 00:29:12,928
You have three seconds to tell me where the target is,

586
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,800
or I will kill you.

587
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,029
Where's the target?

588
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,100
A natural gas distribution center.

589
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,400
There are dozens of those in the city. Which one?

590
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,860
I don't know. I swear.

591
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,330
I don't know. I don't.

592
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,760
Jack, what's going on?

593
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,500
Bierko's targeting a natural gas distribution center,

594
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
but we don't know which one.

595
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:55,305
- Natural gas?  - He can use it as a delivery system for the Sentox.

596
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,360
He can get it into people's homes.

597
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:58,811
I need you to get Chloe on it. We need to find out which one.

598
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:01,177
Right. The rescinding order will be here in 15 minutes.

599
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,800
Good. Give it to the marshal. He'll be looking for this, too.

600
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,360
Please, no more. I'm begging you.

601
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,330
Please. Don't do that. Please...

602
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,100
Please. I'm telling you the truth.

603
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:17,798
- You're bringing this on yourself.  - No!

604
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:18,693
Stop it! 

605
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,530
- This can end whenever you want it to...  - Make him...

606
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,400
Let her go!

607
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,016
- Shut it down now!  - Jack!

608
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,130
You are finished in here. She is innocent.

609
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:28,442
You can confirm it with Buchanan.

610
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:29,659
I said you're finished.

611
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:31,265
Get out!

612
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,704
- Audrey, are you all right?  - I don't know.

613
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,860
It's over.

614
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:40,797
I promise you, it's over for good.

615
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:44,237
My God, tell me... tell me what's happening?

616
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,030
Henderson set you up... to get at me,

617
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,860
to throw me off his trail.

618
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,100
Come here.

619
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,860
I'm so sorry.

620
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:03,581
Jack, the only thing that got me through this...

621
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,007
was knowing that you would come.

622
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:08,155
I knew you would come.

623
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,600
I'm so sorry.

624
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:32,383
Bauer.

625
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,817
Jack, it's Bill. Chloe's got some information. We need you.

626
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,430
Go.

627
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,260
Jack?

628
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:40,484
I'll be right there.

629
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,200
Bill, I want you to send someone

630
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,060
over from medical to Interrogation 1 to tend to Audrey Raines.

631
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:46,114
Okay.

632
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,430
Thanks.

633
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,000
I'll be right back.

634
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:03,643
Go. I'm okay.

635
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:11,988
Our satellite covers only 60% of the distribution centers.

636
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,600
If our target's not in that grouping, we're out of luck.

637
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,264
- Can we redirect any other satellite?  - I'm trying.

638
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,930
Did you identify the distribution center that they're gonna hit?

639
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,260
We're pulling in more satellites.

640
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,230
Our analysts tell us

641
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,460
once the Sentox hits the main tank, it goes right into the pipes,

642
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,860
where it becomes impossible to stop.

643
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,360
From there, it goes straight into people's homes.

644
00:32:32,478 --> 00:32:34,258
How many casualties are we talking about?

645
00:32:34,263 --> 00:32:36,163
The largest centers serve 90,000 people.

646
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,300
We could have twice that many casualties.

647
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,160
If our intel is correct, we have 15 minutes.

648
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,200
Okay, I'll prep a team with Curtis. We'll go airborne.

649
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,530
We'll be ready as soon as you ID a target.

650
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,330
Mr. Buchanan?

651
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,730
There may be a faster way.

652
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,560
I was a chem. major at Cal Tech.

653
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,700
Most toxins become inert under high pressure.

654
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,940
The PSI would have to be lowered

655
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:55,987
before the nerve gas was introduced.

656
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,300
Chloe, can you monitor the pressure levels at the distribution centers?

657
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,660
Yeah. I have citywide readings of them all.

658
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Hold on.

659
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,530
Wilshire Gas Company.

660
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:16,252
The PSI has dropped to 75% in the past ten minutes.

661
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:18,697
We have to assume that's it. I'll tell Jack.

662
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,560
Great work, Shari.

663
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,030
Congratulations.

664
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,400
Thanks.

665
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:27,706
Did you see the way his hand brushed across my shoulder as he walked by?

666
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,360
What?

667
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,960
That was wrong.

668
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,100
He shouldn't have done that.

669
00:33:58,878 --> 00:33:59,778
What is it?

670
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:01,585
Get down!

671
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:12,461
Get in the car!

672
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,630
Chloe, what's the PSI level?

673
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:07,753
PSI level is down to 57%.

674
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:10,263
Another seven is all they need to deploy the Sentox.

675
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,500
How long will that take?

676
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,330
Four, maybe five minutes.

677
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,260
Jack, the PSI level can only be adjusted from the main control room.

678
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,100
It's the large building in the center of the complex

679
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,230
two floors down from the roof.

680
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:22,313
Copy that.

681
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,300
Okay, we'll insert here.

682
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,500
We'll advance to the control room,

683
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,100
locate and secure the canisters.

684
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,860
We're almost there.

685
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,660
The noise from the plant should cover our descent.

686
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,030
We're ready.

687
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,130
Good.

688
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,160
Get back here.

689
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,360
Yeah.

690
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,230
How much longer?

691
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,960
A few more minutes.

692
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,530
I can't lower the pressure any faster

693
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,960
without risking a shutdown.

694
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:18,808
Chloe, it's Jack.

695
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,550
Do you have any heat signatures?

696
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,260
Yes, but I can only scan from the exterior of the site.

697
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,130
There are two guards patrolling the perimeter.

698
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,100
I've given the pilot an approach vector

699
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,530
to keep you from their line of sight.

700
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,551
Maintain this position!

701
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:56,551
Yes, sir.

702
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,530
Go!

703
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,360
CTU,

704
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,460
the team's away.

705
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,730
They're on the roof.

706
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,900
The PSI level is down to 54%.

707
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,560
CTU, we're inside.

708
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,360
Jack, Bierko will be ready to deploy any minute.

709
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,330
Copy that.

710
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,660
Silencers off.

711
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,260
Door.

712
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,679
Bierko!

713
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,200
He's moving! Cover me!

714
00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:03,297
Curtis, the Sentox is already in the system.

715
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:05,182
Who's in charge here?

716
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,500
Listen to me.

717
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,980
You have Sentox nerve gas running through your pipeline.

718
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,560
Can you shut down the pumps?

719
00:40:09,686 --> 00:40:11,986
By the time we power down, gas will be in the main tanks,

720
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,430
then it's out into the city.

721
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,530
Where's the closest pipeline that feeds those tanks?

722
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,730
Just out the door to your left.

723
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,100
It'll have a red arrow on it.

724
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,430
Give me the C4 and a timer, then get these people out of here.

725
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,300
Jack, what are you doing?

726
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,200
In order to deliver the Sentox, it had to mix with natural gas.

727
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,400
If we could ignite that gas before it leaves the plant,

728
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,760
the Sentox will be incinerated.

729
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,500
Bill, this is the last chance we've got to stop this threat.

730
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,860
The Sentox has been in the system for one minute.

731
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,860
You have 60 seconds

732
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,230
before it gets out.

733
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,080
The charge has been set.

734
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,460
Curtis, are you clear?

735
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,960
Just about.

736
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,800
Keep going.

737
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,500
Jack, are you clear?

738
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:37,949
Jack?

739
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,800
Jack, respond.

740
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:48,106
Come on, Jack.

741
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,880
Jack, you okay?

742
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:15,808
Curtis, I got a visual on Bierko.

743
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,820
Jack, you won't have time

744
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,620
before the main tank explodes.

745
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,390
Right now he's our only connection to Henderson.

746
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:20,658
Jack!

747
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,560
Bill, he's going in.

748
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,492
Bierko!

749
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,960
Jack, that's it. The main tanks are going.

750
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:47,930
Get out!

751
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:58,000


752
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:09,000

﻿1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,510
What we're doing here is very simple.

2
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,100
We're going to release a certain substance

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,360
so that it flows into your pipelines.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,290
Take the canisters to the main distribution tank quickly.

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,890
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,850
No.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,910
Explain.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,950
We rolled his car, but he survived and got away.

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,990
It was sloppy work, we'll make it right.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,900
Well, you damn well better. You know what's at stake.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,020
Get down!

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,070
It's the truth. Audrey Raines was my contact

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,860
at the Department of Defense.

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,000
- You met with her face to face?  - Yes.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,590
Damn it, Audrey! Tell me the truth!

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,240
I am telling you the truth.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,230
You already lied to me once.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,540
You tell me what you know

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,690
or I promise you this will become very unpleasant.

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,030
Bill, we have a connection

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,210
between Henderson and Collette Stenger.

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,460
He made eight calls to her that she didn't tell us about.

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,080
That voids her agreement, it's off.

24
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,000
You have three seconds to tell me

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,620
where the target is or I will kill you.

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,940
Where is the target?!

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,980
A natural gas distribution center.

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,970
Our analysts tell us

29
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,810
once the Sentox hits the main tank,

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,830
it goes right into the pipes

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,530
where it becomes impossible to stop.

32
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,340
From there, it goes straight into people's homes.

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,370
Sentox is already in the system.

34
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,770
Give me the C-4 and a timer, then get these people out of here.

35
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,150
Jack, what are you doing?

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,740
In order to deliver the Sentox,

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,350
it had to mix with natural gas.

38
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,220
If we can ignite that gas before it leaves the plant,

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,050
the Sentox will be incinerated.

40
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,550
Bierko!

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,060
Jack, that's it, the main tanks are going.

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,890
Get out!

43
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,180
Jack, are you clear?

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,560
Jack, respond.

45
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,070
Curtis, Curtis, this is Audrey.

46
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,530
Any sign of Jack?

47
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,760
Nothing so far.

48
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,740
I've got men searching the main tank area.

49
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,480
Fire and rescue units just arrived.

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,910
They're assessing the situation now.

51
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,120
Chloe, what are we getting from the air monitors?

52
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,170
Come on, Jack.

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,520
Chloe.

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,340
Just minimal trace readings of the nerve agent.

55
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,620
Well below danger levels.

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,840
It looks like the Sentox was incinerated in the blast.

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Jack's plan worked.

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,140
I'm going to brief the White House. Apprise me of any developments.

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,480
Miles.

60
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,720
Curtis, have we done a full search of the area for Jack?

61
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,180
It's underway.

62
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,990
We know he hasn't gone out the north exit.

63
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,200
CTU, Jack's okay.

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,580
Get a medical team over here now!

65
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,820
Jack!

66
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,820
You okay?

67
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,600
Give me a hand.

68
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,170
I got it.

69
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,040
Bierko!

70
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,720
Bierko!

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,000
Bierko!

72
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,230
I need him conscious.

73
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,110
Yes, sir.

74
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,100
The nerve gas, did it leave the plant?

75
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,940
There's no trace of it. Explosion worked.

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,710
Good.

77
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,430
He's going into severe shock. We need to transport him now.

78
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,270
I want him taken back to CTU Medical.

79
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,050
Yes, sir.

80
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,450
Curtis, organize an escort team.

81
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,950
You get him back to CTU alive.

82
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,460
You got it.

83
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,030
On my count. Three, two, one. Let's go.

84
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,700
Buchanan.

85
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,720
Bill, it's Jack.

86
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,080
Is your line still secure?

87
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,770
Yes.

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,430
What's your status on Henderson?

89
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,850
Henderson's still an active protocol.

90
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,640
You need to make him a priority.

91
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,010
Bill, listen to me.

92
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,730
I know Henderson.

93
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,590
He couldn't have planned this.

94
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,530
He's a soldier and a patriot.

95
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,990
However misguided, he believes what he's doing right now

96
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,500
is right for this country.

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,240
He was willing to let his wife die in order

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,070
to protect someone, someone very powerful.

99
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,300
Who?

100
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,080
I don't know.

101
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,510
Bill, I'm scared.

102
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,750
I think this is bigger than anything

103
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,330
we could ever have imagined.

104
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,260
Karen, you're not hearing me.

105
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,970
They managed to prevent an attack,

106
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,590
but that doesn't negate the fact that CTU's performance

107
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,240
has been comprised of one misstep after another.

108
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,370
I'm not disputing that, Mr. Vice President.

109
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,710
Then why the hesitation to carry out your mandate

110
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,800
and have Homeland absorb CTU?

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,470
CTU is still actively

112
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,250
looking for Christopher Henderson.

113
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,340
A shakeup right now could hamper that search.

114
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,770
I'm not going to hold up this takeover

115
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,450
because of a procedural mop up.

116
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,870
Henderson will be caught, you can be sure of that.

117
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,880
- Is that understood?  - Clearly.

118
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,170
Whatever bureaucratic hoops you have to jump through, that's your business.

119
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,420
Just get it done.

120
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,870
- Yes, sir.  - And keep me informed.

121
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,790
I guess we should get started.

122
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,610
Buchanan is not going to take this lying down.

123
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,810
Despite what the vice president said,

124
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,870
CTU just saved a lot of lives.

125
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,450
If Buchanan mounts a challenge, it will be seen in that light.

126
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,450
This action could be easily reversed.

127
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,910
If we were to find someone who would go on record

128
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,970
citing Buchanan's mismanagement,

129
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,360
how he superseded Lynn McGill's authority,

130
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,560
how he allowed CTU to be compromised...

131
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,090
go a long way to mitigating his successes,

132
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,980
give us the protection we need.

133
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,640
Buchanan's people are extremely loyal.

134
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,180
I'm not thinking about a member of CTU.

135
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,320
I'm thinking of Audrey Raines.

136
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,130
She was here all morning.

137
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,450
She saw what went on,

138
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,530
and her loyalty is split between CTU and DOD.

139
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,490
We could take advantage of that.

140
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,680
Let me draft a statement and present it to her.

141
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,180
We're being rolled up, Audrey.

142
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,130
Homeland's taking over.

143
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,710
That's impossible.

144
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,520
Karen told me herself.

145
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,730
No, they can't do that, not after what you've accomplished today.

146
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,910
I'd like to think we've earned a reprieve, but I doubt it.

147
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,720
CTU is in the middle of an investigation.

148
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,410
Henderson is still at large.

149
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,560
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

150
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,280
Karen's taking orders from Vice President Gardner.

151
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,650
He wants this to happen.

152
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,180
Why?

153
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,680
I've been asking myself the same question.

154
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,320
- Yeah.  - We lost him, Sir.

155
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,760
Well, how in the hell did you lose him?

156
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,230
Palmer knocked Cobb out and retrieved his weapon.

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,200
We tried to pursue, but someone came to Palmer's aid.

158
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,380
Who?

159
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,770
That's unclear.

160
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,550
They got away.

161
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,520
All right.

162
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,470
We're going to a fallback, scrub the scene and get over here.

163
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,590
Yes, sir.

164
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,250
You're all right, Mr. Palmer.

165
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,760
Just take it slow.

166
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,230
Aaron?

167
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,360
We're at the presidential retreat.

168
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,220
Can you try to sit up?

169
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,010
I think we need to get you looked at, sir.

170
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,750
No, no, Aaron, there's not enough time for that.

171
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,710
I'm all right.

172
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,060
Then maybe you can explain to me what's going on.

173
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,600
Why were those men trying to kill you?

174
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,410
Because David had a source inside the White House

175
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,200
and someone is trying to prevent me from seeing her.

176
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,430
Who is this source?

177
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,830
Mrs. Logan's assistant.

178
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,460
Evelyn Martin?

179
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,710
Yeah.

180
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,880
Yeah, she and David were trading emails.

181
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,940
Listen, Aaron,

182
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,770
I need to find out the content of those messages.

183
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,090
I think David was killed because of information Evelyn gave him.

184
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,970
Mrs. Logan,

185
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,680
I drafted a letter to the families of the victims

186
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,970
at the Sunrise Hills Mall. It's here for your review.

187
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,970
Thank you.

188
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,470
And your schedule's there as well.

189
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,020
You have a 9:00 a. m. with the press office

190
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,120
and the president wants you in on his morning briefing.

191
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,390
Evelyn...

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,880
You all right?

193
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,970
I'm fine. Just tired.

194
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,880
It's been a long day.

195
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,920
I'm surprised any of us got through it.

196
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, do you have your credentials with you?

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,690
There's still a curfew in place.

198
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,460
I have them with me.

199
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,980
Good. Try to get some rest.

200
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,380
- Good night.  - Good night.

201
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,880
Evelyn.

202
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,750
Hi.

203
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,360
I really need to talk to you.

204
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,670
I'm sorry, Mr. Palmer, I need to go home.

205
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,570
Ma'am.

206
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,420
Please.

207
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
This won't take but a second.

208
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,370
You were sending emails to my brother, Evelyn.

209
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,620
Why?

210
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,660
Mr. Palmer, I don't know what you're talking about.

211
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,930
I traced the IP account.

212
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,250
I traced it right to your address,

213
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,120
So, yes, you do know what I'm talking about.

214
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,180
I need to know what you told David.

215
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,460
I didn't tell him anything.

216
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,420
Evelyn,

217
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,930
I have the record of your correspondence.

218
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
David deleted the content on the messages,

219
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,670
but I know, Evelyn,

220
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,450
I know you were in contact with him,

221
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,150
so please don't lie to me again.

222
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,020
Tell me what I need to know.

223
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,700
Someone killed David.

224
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,120
They killed him and they just tried to kill me.

225
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,070
Now, I think they knew I was coming here to see you.

226
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,880
So I think that means we're both in danger, don't you?

227
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,980
Please, I have to go now.

228
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,360
Tell me what I need!

229
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Talk to me!

230
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,010
I can't.

231
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,810
They kidnapped my little girl.

232
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,310
They kidnapped my little girl. They kidnapped my baby.

233
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,750
They said they would give Amy back to me

234
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,390
if I gave them the evidence.

235
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,520
What evidence?

236
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,220
I have proof about who is behind everything

237
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,600
that's happened today.

238
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,270
They're going to kill my baby.

239
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,710
- Evelyn, okay...  - They're going to kill...

240
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,170
Listen to me, all right? Listen.

241
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,890
Even if you turn over this evidence,

242
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,030
they're not just going to give you back your daughter

243
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,190
and let you go. That's not what these people do.

244
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,940
Now, you've got to trust me, Evelyn.

245
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,530
Please, talk to me.

246
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,320
Ma'am, if I may?

247
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,860
Mr. Palmer's right.

248
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,980
You know too much.

249
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,140
They'll kill you both.

250
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,910
I'll give you the evidence that I have

251
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,640
if you get me back my daughter.

252
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,800
I pulled up Henderson's work records for the past ten years.

253
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,170
It's a lot of material.

254
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,690
I'll start data-mining, see if there's anything

255
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,020
we can use to track him down.

256
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,850
That's Chloe O'Brian.

257
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,320
That's Jim Hill, from Homeland.

258
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,480
I'm Jim Hill, Homeland Security.

259
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,780
Could you show me your station,

260
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,290
Chloe O'Brian?

261
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,430
Yeah?

262
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,730
I'm taking over your station.

263
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,480
I'll need all your relevant access codes.

264
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,450
Who are you? What's going on here?

265
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,610
May I have your attention, please?

266
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,670
These men and women are from Homeland Security.

267
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,980
I've just authorized a unit-wide backslash protocol.

268
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,910
CTU is being absorbed

269
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,220
by the Department of Homeland Security.

270
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,930
Ladies and gentlemen, I realize this is sudden,

271
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,730
and this has been a very difficult day.

272
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,110
But let's all cooperate

273
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,710
to make this transition as smooth as possible.

274
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,580
There is still work to be done.

275
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,000
Vladimir Bierko is on route to CTU,

276
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,920
and Christopher Henderson remains an open protocol.

277
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,860
Thank you.

278
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,740
Ms. Raines,

279
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,170
would you mind joining me in the Situation Room?

280
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,620
Why?

281
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,730
We need to speak in private.

282
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,100
Fine.

283
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,010
- This is Bauer.  - Jack, it's Wayne Palmer.

284
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,980
Wayne. 

285
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Are you all right?

286
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,860
I just heard about that explosion at the gas plant.

287
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,180
Yeah, I'm fine.

288
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,320
Listen, Wayne, I wish I could tell you

289
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,640
that all the people that were responsible

290
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,190
for your brother's assassination are in custody, but I can't.

291
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,260
Yeah, well, maybe I can help you with that.

292
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,770
How?

293
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,500
Jack, I'm at President Logan's retreat.

294
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,210
I'm here with Evelyn Martin, Mrs. Logan's personal assistant.

295
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,910
What does Evelyn Martin have to do with this?

296
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,780
She says she has proof there were other people involved

297
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,290
in the plot to kill my brother.

298
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,520
And I believe her.

299
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,330
Who?

300
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,630
She won't tell me.

301
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,770
Why not?

302
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,400
Her eight-year-old daughter's been kidnapped.

303
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,150
They're going to kill her

304
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,010
unless Evelyn hands over the evidence.

305
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,530
This has to be Henderson.

306
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,400
They're supposed to call any minute with a place to meet.

307
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,610
Okay. I want to be on that call when it comes in.

308
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,600
CTU will provide operational support.

309
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,360
We're going to need a place to meet.

310
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,820
I passed an old barn about a mile west of the retreat off Service Road 19.

311
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,520
Service Road 19.

312
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,030
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

313
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,050
See you then.

314
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,400
Jack's going to meet us. We should go.

315
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,070
Evelyn, listen. They may be watching you,

316
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,180
so I don't think we should leave together.

317
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,140
What do you want to do?

318
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,750
We'll separate.

319
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,670
Get to your car, and we'll meet up in the parking lot.

320
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,670
I'll see you soon.

321
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,500
"... the acting director's failure

322
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,990
to enhance security measures, especially in the light

323
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,640
of the heightened threat, effectively

324
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,010
invited the subsequent attack

325
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,660
that resulted in loss of personnel? "

326
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,960
You can't possibly expect me to sign this.

327
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,300
It's a complete distortion of today's event

328
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,860
designed to place blame on Bill Buchanan and CTU.

329
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,540
But you would agree that today's attacks

330
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,900
represent a serious intelligence failure

331
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,460
that needs to be addressed.

332
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,700
Thanks to CTU,

333
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,240
hundreds of thousands of people are alive

334
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,750
who would otherwise be dead.

335
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,360
But, if CTU had been operating effectively,

336
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,340
those people would never have been at risk.

337
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,840
I couldn't more strongly disagree with this statement.

338
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,250
Well, I'm disappointed with your decision,

339
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,810
but I appreciate your loyalty.

340
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,320
Of course.

341
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,490
Oh, just to confirm.

342
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,940
As on-site liaison for DOD,

343
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,080
you participated in today's decision-making process.

344
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,250
What's your point?

345
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,210
Serious mistakes were made here today

346
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,070
that resulted in the loss of American lives.

347
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,420
It would be a shame to see the taint

348
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,200
of CTU's mismanagement

349
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,510
spread to your agency...

350
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,200
and your career.

351
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,360
By signing this,

352
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,490
you isolate the fallout for today's mistakes

353
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,200
to Bill Buchanan and CTU...

354
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,940
where it belongs.

355
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,490
I'm proud

356
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,240
of what we did here today.

357
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,300
The people of CTU are heroes,

358
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,650
especially Bill Buchanan.

359
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,820
This takeover is completely unwarranted,

360
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,840
and I won't help you justify it.

361
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,200
Hello.

362
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
- Audrey, it's Jack.  - Jack, where are you?

363
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,630
I'm on my way to see Wayne Palmer.

364
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,710
Wayne Palmer?

365
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,950
Wayne just told me that Evelyn Martin,

366
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,350
Senior Aide to the First Lady has evidence that would prove

367
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,680
who was really behind David Palmer's assassination.

368
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,450
But she won't give the evidence to Wayne

369
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,790
because her daughter's been kidnapped

370
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,520
in an effort is trying to keep her quiet.

371
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,700
I think Henderson's behind this.

372
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,020
They want to make a trade:

373
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,550
the evidence for the girl.

374
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,800
My God, Jack!

375
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,710
Yeah, I'm going to need you to retask a satellite

376
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,560
to those coordinates. I'll have them in a few minutes.

377
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,140
Jack, that could be difficult right now.

378
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,910
Why?

379
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,430
CTU is being rolled up.

380
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,960
Karen Hayes is replacing everyone

381
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,650
with people from Homeland.

382
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,510
What are you talking about? That doesn't make sense.

383
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,290
I know.

384
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,170
Even if she has a reason to, we're in the middle

385
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,630
of tracking down Christopher Henderson.

386
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,580
We'll never be able to bring her team up to speed.

387
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,590
I know she's taking orders from Vice President Gardner himself.

388
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,200
Gardner.

389
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,110
Jack, maybe you should talk to Karen directly.

390
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,010
No.

391
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,520
She's the one in control here.

392
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,080
When I was interrogating Henderson,

393
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,700
it was obvious that he was protecting someone,

394
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,080
someone very powerful.

395
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,670
He was willing to let his wife die

396
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,020
rather than give him up.

397
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,070
And now, all of a sudden, Vice President Gardner

398
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,840
is shutting down CTU when we're actually

399
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,470
in a position to bring Henderson in?

400
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,400
Do you really think that Gardner's involved with this?

401
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,510
We can't afford to take the chance that he's not.

402
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,520
All right, what do you want me to do?

403
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,140
I want you to get Chloe to retask the satellite.

404
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,700
I'll get the coordinates over to you.

405
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,270
Jack, Chloe has been let go,

406
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,980
along with the rest of her department.

407
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,440
Audrey, I need the satellite.

408
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,530
Just figure out a way to get Chloe back on.

409
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,350
All right, all right, I'll call you back.

410
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,940
I could approach some of the senior CTU staffers.

411
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,500
I told you, that's a waste of time.

412
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,790
They're worried about their jobs.

413
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,510
We could promise them some security.

414
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,050
Excuse me.

415
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,030
I've reconsidered my position.

416
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,180
I'll sign your statement.

417
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,070
May I ask why the sudden change of heart?

418
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,480
I don't necessarily agree with everything

419
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,820
that is in the statement, but I do see

420
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,720
the need to shield DOD of any possible controversy

421
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,820
that could reflect back on my father.

422
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,670
Miles.

423
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,900
Thank you.

424
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,840
I want one thing in return.

425
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,110
What's that?

426
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,840
That Chloe be kept on and assigned to me.

427
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,300
Why Chloe?

428
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,710
I'm going to need considerable

429
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,080
server access to compile my report for DOD.

430
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
Chloe can help me finish it in half the time.

431
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,110
There are other people who can do that job.

432
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,440
I have a working relationship with Chloe.

433
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,890
She's an asset that you cannot afford to lose.

434
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,500
Do we have a deal?

435
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,220
Yes.

436
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,630
Good.

437
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,770
All right.

438
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,430
Evelyn Martin will be leaving the presidential retreat in a couple of minutes.

439
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,150
It's time to get going.

440
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,930
What about the girl?

441
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,830
I'll take care of her.

442
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,130
Wayne Palmer.

443
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,230
I'm at my car.

444
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,230
No one's around.

445
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,130
- We're on our way.  - Okay.

446
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,830
I'm extremely uncomfortable sending the two of you off without protection.

447
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,230
Aaron, we've been over this.

448
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,530
If you leave the compound again,

449
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,030
we're going to risk raising suspicion.

450
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,230
I know it, sir.

451
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,330
But I don't like it.

452
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,430
Wayne.

453
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,930
Well, this is a surprise.

454
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,030
We didn't know you were coming.

455
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,330
Are you here to see the president?

456
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,830
No.

457
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,230
Mr. Palmer came here to give me a memento from his brother.

458
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,630
It's a service medal.

459
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,130
Sorry, I just...

460
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,630
I knew you and the president were going to be dealing with this crisis today,

461
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,330
and I just...

462
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,030
I don't want you people to feel obliged to see me.

463
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,030
There would never, ever be any obligation on our part, Wayne,

464
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,430
especially under the circumstances.

465
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,530
I just want you to know how sorry I am.

466
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,330
Your brother was one of the greatest men who ever occupy the office.

467
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,430
And his loss,

468
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,930
to all of us,

469
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,330
can't be expressed in words.

470
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,430
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

471
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,030
And I know that

472
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,330
the president would also like to express his condolences to you personally.

473
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,130
That means a lot, sir,

474
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,130
but unfortunately I have a plane to catch.

475
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,830
I'm, uh...

476
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,930
flying David's body back to Washington, so...

477
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,430
Oh, I understand.

478
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,030
Safe trip.

479
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:14,930
Thank you, sir.

480
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,830
I'll walk you out, sir.

481
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,630
Excuse me.

482
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,530
Mr. Buchanan.

483
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,730
Miss O'Brian, we're not done here.

484
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,430
How can they get away with this?

485
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,130
Chloe, this is not over.

486
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,830
Just follow your instructions.

487
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,830
Oh, it sure seems over.

488
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,830
Everyone's getting fired.

489
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,430
I'm going to do everything I can to get that order rescinded.

490
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,130
Once the details of what we accomplished here today are made public,

491
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,230
I'm confident we'll be back at our posts.

492
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,830
The best thing you can do is stay focused

493
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,130
and follow your orders.

494
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,930
Do you understand me?

495
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,630
Yes, sir.

496
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,730
It's going to be all right.

497
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,230
O'Brian, don't transfer your station to Valerie.

498
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,530
You got a pass.

499
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,230
I did?

500
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,130
Yeah. So get back to work.

501
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:09,930
I don't understand.

502
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,730
Why am I staying and everybody else is being let go?

503
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,130
Because Miss Raines requested that you keep your position.

504
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,630
What has Audrey Raines have to do with this?

505
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,560
Miss Raines signed a detailed statement 

506
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,530
documenting the numerous missteps made today by CTU.

507
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,130
And by you in particular.

508
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,030
So, for the moment,

509
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,430
she gets what she wants,

510
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,530
and she wants O'Brian.

511
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,630
Audrey would never sign anything like that.

512
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,430
I did sign it, Bill.

513
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,530
Why?

514
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,830
Because it's the truth.

515
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,710
You realize this effectively kills 

516
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,930
any chance we have of rescinding that order.

517
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,130
Yes, I know.

518
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,830
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,730
O'Brian.

520
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,930
I got a call from a man about an hour ago

521
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,430
who told me that he had my daughter.

522
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,030
That if I wanted to see her alive again,

523
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,130
that I would have to follow his exact instructions.

524
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,530
Did he give you proof he had her?

525
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,230
I talked to her.

526
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,730
She sounded so scared.

527
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,030
You told anybody else about this?

528
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,530
I couldn't.

529
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,230
He said that if I did, he would know.

530
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,130
Evelyn, listen,

531
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,430
I know we have a deal.

532
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,430
And I'm going to do everything I can to get your daughter back.

533
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,030
No, I told you before.

534
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,830
I can't tell you anything until I have Amy back.

535
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,130
You called David with this information.

536
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,830
Why him?

537
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,130
I knew him.

538
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,430
He and the First Lady were friends.

539
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,130
He was truly a wonderful man.

540
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,930
Yes.

541
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,730
Yes, he was.

542
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,330
I still can't accept talking about him in the past tense.

543
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,030
I just...

544
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,730
I just can't believe he's gone.

545
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,330
I told him this information because I trusted him.

546
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,830
I never thought for a moment that it would endanger him.

547
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,030
I have your brother's blood on my hands,

548
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,930
and for that, I will never forgive myself.

549
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,230
Evelyn, you did nothing wrong.

550
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,130
It's them.

551
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,630
Bauer.

552
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,930
Jack, the call's coming through.

553
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,630
Patch me in.

554
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,830
You're ready for this?

555
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,830
Hello.

556
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,230
What took you so long to answer, Evelyn?

557
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,030
I was just passing through security.

558
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,230
I just left the retreat.

559
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,330
Are you alone?

560
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,630
Yes.

561
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,930
Why was Wayne Palmer at the retreat?

562
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,430
Wayne Palmer?

563
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,830
Please don't waste my time.

564
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,220
He was there for a reason,

565
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,930
and it wasn't to drop off his resume.

566
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,130
I think he was there to speak with you.

567
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,630
I didn't even know he was there.

568
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,830
I don't believe you.

569
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,530
I didn't see him.

570
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,130
Evelyn, if you're lying to me,

571
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,930
it's your daughter who will suffer.

572
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,430
I'm telling you the truth.

573
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,030
Please, you have to believe me.

574
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,330
Did you bring what we discussed?

575
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,230
Yes.

576
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,730
Please, let me talk to Amy.

577
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,030
Very well.

578
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,230
All right, sweetheart,

579
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,130
this is your mommy.

580
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,030
Say hello.

581
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,030
- Mommy?  - It's me, honey.

582
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,930
Are you okay?

583
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,030
Uh-huh. Are you coming to get me now?

584
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,930
Mommy's going to be there real soon.

585
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,330
I want you to keep being brave.

586
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,130
Okay?

587
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,430
Can you promise me?

588
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,030
I promise.

589
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,030
I love you, my baby.

590
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,630
I love you, too.

591
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,530
Okay, that's enough, sweetheart.

592
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,630
Very good.

593
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,130
Now take down this address.

594
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,330
4615 Tarpin Street.

595
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:13,630
Got it?

596
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,830
Yes, I've got it.

597
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,030
- Hello?  - Audrey, it's Jack.

598
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,330
I just got off the call.

599
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,630
It was Henderson.

600
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,930
Have you got Chloe back on line?

601
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,430
- Audrey?  - Sorry, Jack.

602
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,630
Yes, Chloe's still here.

603
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,430
Okay, I'm going to give the address for the satellite sweep.

604
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,430
All right, go ahead.

605
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,530
4615 Tarpin.

606
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,730
All right.

607
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,830
Give me a few minutes.

608
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,030
Chloe, I need you to come with me.

609
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,230
Don't talk to me.

610
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,030
It's for Jack.

611
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,030
Jack?

612
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,130
Chloe, Jack needs your help.

613
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,130
Please.

614
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,730
Fine.

615
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,530
What the hell's going on?

616
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,730
I had to keep Karen from replacing you.

617
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,030
That's why I signed the document.

618
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,130
I didn't have a choice.

619
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,630
I don't understand.

620
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,830
Chloe, you're the only one that Jack and I trust here.

621
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,430
Jack needs one of the satellites retasked.

622
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,630
Why?

623
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,730
Here's the address.

624
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,830
We need a full infrared sweep.

625
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,430
I'm going to need an explanation.

626
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,930
Chloe, I promise you,

627
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,530
I will give you one,

628
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,830
but right now we need to hurry.

629
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,200
Something's wrong.

630
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,200
- Wayne.  - Jack.

631
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,300
- You're all right?  - Yeah.

632
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,600
It's good to see you.

633
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,800
Good to see you, too.

634
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,900
Evelyn,

635
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,100
my name is Jack Bauer.

636
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,500
I promise you,

637
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
we're gonna to get your daughter back.

638
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,000
Right now I need to know what you know.

639
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,600
I already told them

640
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,300
I won't give up any information

641
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,600
until I have my daughter.

642
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,180
Fine.

643
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,150
Excuse me for one second.

644
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,250
- Audrey Raines?  - Audrey, it's Jack. Let me speak to Chloe.

645
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,540
Okay, Jack, hold on.

646
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,070
Jack, you're on speaker.

647
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,790
Jack, Audrey told me what's happening.

648
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,930
I can't believe the vice president's involved in this.

649
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,110
Yeah, I know.

650
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,890
Where are we with the satellite?

651
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,500
It's coming up now.

652
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,150
I'm sending the image to your PDA.

653
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,770
There are men all over the place.

654
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,150
How many?

655
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,940
I'm counting ten.

656
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,820
Okay. I want you to keep the satellite on target.

657
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,500
I want you to download real-time images to my PDA.

658
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,080
Okay.

659
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,500
Jack?

660
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,640
I'm going to go with Evelyn in her car to make the exchange.

661
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,060
I want you to find somewhere safe, and I want you to stay there

662
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,610
- until this is over.  - No, I'm going with you.

663
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,840
I can't allow that. This is going to be extremely dangerous.

664
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,920
I was a Marine, Jack.

665
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,360
I know that, Wayne.

666
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,960
And you never saw a combat.

667
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,880
There's a big difference between training to kill someone

668
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,380
and actually having to do it.

669
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,380
I can't put you in harm's way out of respect to your brother.

670
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,760
Your family needs you now.

671
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,040
These are the people who killed my brother, Jack.

672
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,200
They shot a bullet right through his neck,

673
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,830
and then he died in my arms.

674
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,060
Put yourself in my position.

675
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,460
Could you just walk away?

676
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,950
No.

677
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,580
Neither can I.

678
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm coming with you, Jack.

679
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,980
Thank you for your support, Mr. Prime Minister.

680
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,950
Give my regards to your lovely wife.

681
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,810
We'll talk soon.

682
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,670
It's going to take me better part of the day to return all these phone calls.

683
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,340
That's wonderful, Mr. President.

684
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,220
World leaders, prominent Americans.

685
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,730
They're all lining up to offer their congratulations.

686
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,430
Uh, sir, were you aware that Wayne Palmer was on the premises?

687
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,780
He was?

688
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,850
Yes, I just spoke with him,

689
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,900
not a half hour ago, he just left.

690
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,200
You didn't speak with him?

691
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,660
No.

692
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,870
What was he doing here?

693
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,800
Well, he said he had a memento from President Palmer

694
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,620
he wanted to give to Aaron Pierce. It was a service medal.

695
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,030
That explains it.

696
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,120
David and Aaron were very close.

697
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,790
I'm just surprised he didn't want to speak with you.

698
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,870
Well, it's no secret that his brother and I

699
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,070
had our share of disagreements over the years.

700
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,530
It's possible Wayne harbors ill feelings towards me.

701
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,740
That must be the reason.

702
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,220
Clear on the plan?

703
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,120
I don't think I can do this.

704
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,010
Evelyn, do you want to see your little girl again?

705
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,390
Because these men didn't hesitate

706
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,310
to kill President Palmer and they're not gonna hesitate

707
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,360
to kill you and your daughter once they get what they want.

708
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,140
Right now, I am your last chance.

709
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,540
We have to stick to the plan, do you understand me?

710
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,560
Okay, once you have your daughter in your arms...

711
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,010
I know what to do.

712
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,000
We are going to get her back.

713
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,850
Let's go.

714
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,650
Call out testing. One, two, three.

715
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,950
Testing, one, two, three.

716
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,740
Chloe, did you get that?

717
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,440
You're coming through now. I'm refreshing your screen.

718
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,590
Okay, we're at the southeast corner entrance.

719
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,130
Jack, there's a tunnel through that door

720
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,000
that leads to a conveyor belt that lets out into the middle of the plant.

721
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,590
Be careful, there's a hostile at the exit.

722
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,490
Copy that.

723
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,650
Draw your weapon.

724
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,080
Let's go.

725
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,310
Bravo, check. Have you got a visual on the mark?

726
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,900
Negative, sir.

727
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,770
All units holding.

728
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,380
Copy.

729
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,540
This way.

730
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,840
Let's go.

731
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,550
Damn it, there's too many of them.

732
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,120
We're running out of time.

733
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,830
I'm gonna need you to take out one of their guards

734
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,030
so I can climb to the top of this structure and take out the sniper.

735
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,280
He's about a hundred yards north of here,

736
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,950
just on the other side of the conveyor belt.

737
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,870
Can you do that?

738
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,760
Yeah. I can do it.

739
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,310
Wait. One of them is moving.

740
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,860
Go.

741
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,350
Mr. Palmer, can you hear me?

742
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,080
Copy. I'm on the south side of the lower belt moving west.

743
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,810
Continue to the end, your target's to the north.

744
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,600
Jack, it's all clear.

745
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,470
This is Bravo.

746
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,130
I think I hear a car.

747
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,410
Vehicle headed north.

748
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,310
Single occupant, female, over.

749
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,940
Bravo, what have you got?

750
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,430
I repeat, Bravo, what have you got?

751
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,980
Bravo, come in.

752
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,500
The woman is alone in the car.

753
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,200
Say again, I didn't get that.

754
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,900
I repeat, the woman is alone in the car.

755
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,750
Copy.

756
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,250
Chloe, we've taken out four men.

757
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,220
Evelyn has moved into position. 

758
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,540
Wayne, I want you to wait for my signal.

759
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,370
Copy.

760
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,440
We need Henderson alive. Do not shoot to kill. 

761
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
Repeat, do not shoot to kill.

762
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,160
Yes?

763
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,430
Evelyn, open all the doors and the trunk of the car.

764
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,380
Very good, Evelyn. Now go to the front of the car 

765
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,930
and drop the keys on the ground.

766
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,450
I have the evidence with me.

767
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,720
I want my daughter.

768
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,390
Bravo, hold your position. I'm coming out.

769
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,370
I have a visual on Henderson and the girl.

770
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,200
Okay, Evelyn, give me the evidence.

771
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,370
I'll give you the evidence once you give me Amy.

772
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,230
Come on, let her go.

773
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,010
Okay, honey, go see your mommy.

774
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,150
Mommy!

775
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,190
She's moving.

776
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,140
Give me the evidence, Evelyn.

777
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,380
Get down. Get down.

778
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,110
Bravo, check. Come in.

779
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,430
Bravo. Come in, Bravo.

780
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,280
Wayne, I didn't get him. If you got a shot, take it.

781
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,460
Chloe, it's Jack. Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car.

782
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,680
Do you have him on satellite?

783
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,800
We saw it, Jack, but he's leaving the search grid.

784
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,180
We're thermal-scanning the plant, not the entire neighborhood.

785
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,150
Well then reprogram it! We can't lose him!

786
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,040
Is she all right?

787
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,540
Evelyn's been hit.

788
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,030
The bullet passed right through. It hasn't hit an artery.

789
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,680
It's not serious, but it's gonna have to be dressed.

790
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,300
Evelyn, you've got your daughter back.

791
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,860
Now tell me what I need to know.

792
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,740
Who is behind this? Is it the vice president?

793
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,060
Evelyn, is it the vice president?

794
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,280
The vice president has nothing to do with this.

795
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,120
You promised me you would control the situation.

796
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,290
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir.

797
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,080
He outmaneuvered me.

798
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,730
Sir, Bauer and Wayne Palmer won't be around long enough

799
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,240
to tell anybody else what they know.

800
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,920
I'm putting together another team.

801
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,020
I will handle this, sir. I promise you.

802
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,590
I will not let you down.

803
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,880
See that you don't.

804
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


805
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,550
CTU is being absorbed by the Department of Homeland Security, 

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,350
and Christopher Henderson remains an open protocol. 

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,790
Ms. Raines signed a detailed statement

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,690
documenting the numerous missteps made today by CTU,

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,590
and by you, in particular. 

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,520
I don't understand why am I staying

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,990
and everybody else is being let go?

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,720
Because Ms. Raines requested that you keep your position. 

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,390
I had to keep Karen from replacing you, 

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,620
that's why I signed the document, 

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,350
I didn't have a choice. 

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,690
Why were those men trying to kill you?

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,150
David had a source inside the White House. 

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,720
Who's the source?

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,720
Mrs. Logan's assistant. 

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,090
I have proof about who's behind

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,390
everything that's happened today. 

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,550
Someone killed David...

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,420
and they just tried to kill me. 

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,290
- I have to go now... - Give me what I need!

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,320
They kidnapped my little girl. 

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,150
Evelyn. 

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,950
I promise you we're going to get your daughter back. 

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,450
I already told them

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,820
I wouldn't give up any information

26
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,090
until I have my daughter. 

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,920
We need Henderson alive;

28
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,990
do not shoot to kill. 

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,390
Did you bring what we discussed?

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,350
I have the evidence with me. 

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,420
I want my daughter. 

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,290
She's moving. 

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,720
Give me the evidence, Evelyn. 

34
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,420
Now. 

35
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,720
Wayne, I didn't get him...

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,150
if you got a shot, take it!

37
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,520
Chloe, it's Jack, Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car!

38
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,950
Do you have him on satellite?

39
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,520
We can't lose him!

40
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,150
Evelyn's been hit. 

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,320
It's not serious, 

42
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,720
but it's gonna have to be dressed. 

43
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,950
Evelyn, you've got your daughter back, 

44
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,590
now tell me what I need to know. 

45
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,790
Who is behind this? Is it the vice president?

46
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,550
The vice president has nothing to do with this!

47
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,750
You promised me you would control the situation. 

48
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,950
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir. 

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,120
Bauer and Wayne Palmer won't be around long enough

50
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,620
to tell anybody else what they know. 

51
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,320
I will not let you down. 

52
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,050
See that you don't. 

53
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,400
With White House-imposed martial law and curfew still in effect throughout the area, 

54
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,280
- all traffic is restricted to emergency vehicles.  - Wayne, turn that off.

55
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,050
The lanes are cut off. 

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,590
Okay, Evelyn, I need you to stay focused. 

57
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,650
The recording of the phone call that you made

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,220
between President Logan and Henderson

59
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,220
is in a safety deposit box... which bank?

60
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,520
Which bank?

61
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,550
City Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills. 

62
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,590
Where's the key?

63
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,590
My jacket pocket. 

64
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,850
Mom?

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,150
It's all right, sweetheart, 

66
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,450
your mom's going to be fine. 

67
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,650
She's going to be fine, okay?

68
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,790
Jack, you heard what they said. 

69
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,220
We have to get off this road, 

70
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,290
there are military patrols everywhere. 

71
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,920
There's a motel up there on the right. 

72
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,750
Turn in there. 

73
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,520
I want to go home. 

74
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,790
We're gonna get you home, honey. 

75
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,750
We're gonna get you home. 

76
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,120
Wayne, can you get us a room. 

77
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,650
I'll keep watch. 

78
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,490
Make sure you keep pressure on the wound, 

79
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,620
I'll be right back. 

80
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,020
- Hello? - Audrey, it's Jack. 

81
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,650
Have you got Henderson on satellite yet?

82
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,820
No, Chloe wasn't able to reposition in time. 

83
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,990
Damn it!

84
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,420
Are you still on a secure line?

85
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,520
Yes. Why, what's going on?

86
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,590
Evelyn didn't implicate Gardner. 

87
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,490
She implicated President Logan. 

88
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,750
Oh, my God, Jack. 

89
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,290
Logan? Are you sure?

90
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,620
She said he was responsible for everything that happened today, 

91
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,850
starting with providing the terrorists with the nerve gas. 

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,550
That's what David Palmer found out. 

93
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,690
That's why they killed him. 

94
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,920
Are you saying that President Logan

95
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,350
ordered Palmer's assassination?

96
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,450
Henderson gave the order. 

97
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,720
But Evelyn says she has evidence

98
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,350
that shows that President Logan was complicit. 

99
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,990
What kind of evidence?

100
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,920
She recorded a conversation earlier this morning

101
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,390
between Henderson and President Logan. 

102
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,120
She put it in a safety deposit box in a bank. 

103
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,390
We're on our way to get it now. 

104
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,820
Jack, the city is under martial law. 

105
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,220
I know. I need you to upload

106
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,490
every military checkpoint to my PDA

107
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,120
so we can navigate our way around them. 

108
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,590
All right, I'll take care of that. 

109
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,850
Audrey, as soon as I have the recording, 

110
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,550
we're going to have to involve your father. 

111
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,550
We need someone in the government, someone credible, 

112
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,250
to present the evidence. 

113
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,990
All right. 

114
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,050
He's on his way back from a summit in Japan. 

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,290
I'll call him on the plane. 

116
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,520
Okay. Make sure you leave CTU

117
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,620
before you do anything. 

118
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,250
You don't think that they can be trusted?

119
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,150
Right now, we can't trust anyone. 

120
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,190
Logan will have every federal law enforcement agency, 

121
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,190
the military, 

122
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,320
all at his disposal. 

123
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,350
And he will use them to try and stop us. 

124
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,690
Don't fill your father in on the particulars. 

125
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,120
Just try and set up the meeting. 

126
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,390
I'll get back to you

127
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,920
as soon as I have the recording. 

128
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,650
All right, I'll upload those checkpoints. Yeah. 

129
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,620
Wayne?

130
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,250
The bank manager was listed. 

131
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,150
That's his address, he's not far. 

132
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,320
Good. Let's get them in the room. 

133
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,790
Hey... we need to get inside now. 

134
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,820
Come on, it's okay. 

135
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,350
Give me your arm. 

136
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,590
You can sit right here, okay?

137
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,520
Okay. Lie down here on the bed. 

138
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm sorry, but it's not safe enough

139
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,590
to take you to a hospital yet. 

140
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,220
Let me see, let me see. 

141
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,420
Wayne?

142
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,790
Take Amy outside for a second. 

143
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,450
Okay, even though the bullet went through, 

144
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,450
I'm still going to have to clean out this wound. 

145
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
It's gonna hurt. 

146
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,090
But I promise you I'll get you to a hospital

147
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,090
as soon as I can. 

148
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,150
In the meantime, 

149
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,290
I'm going to have Wayne look after you. 

150
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,420
No. I'll be fine. 

151
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,820
You need to get the evidence. 

152
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,920
And you'll need help. 

153
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,950
Are you sure?

154
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,390
Yeah. 

155
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,190
Okay. 

156
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,490
Keep pressure on it. 

157
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,720
Sweetheart, you can see your mom now. 

158
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,390
Give me the car keys. 

159
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,020
Let's go. 

160
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,390
I haven't been able to pick up Bauer's trail yet. 

161
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,850
So he got away. 

162
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
And there's nothing to stop him and Wayne Palmer

163
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,650
from going to the media with everything they know. 

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,850
Jack knows there's no point in going public

165
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,950
until he has proof. 

166
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,690
He won't make any accusations

167
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,550
until he has that evidence in his hand. 

168
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,220
This evidence, this... this recording that Evelyn made

169
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,220
of our conversation. 

170
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,090
Are you any closer to finding out

171
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,220
where she's hidden it?

172
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,390
No, sir, not yet. 

173
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,590
But she was wounded, and I will find her;

174
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,950
we're monitoring hospitals, emergency services. 

175
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,850
This is containable, I promise you. 

176
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,850
Please spare me your promises, Mr. Henderson. 

177
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,750
It's all gone wrong. 

178
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,220
None of this should have happened. 

179
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,920
All these killings...

180
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,650
This whole thing was planned to make our country safer. 

181
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,990
Stronger. 

182
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,020
To protect our interests. 

183
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,350
And it all spiraled out of control

184
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,850
when you decided to kill David Palmer. 

185
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,120
Mr. President, what's done is done. 

186
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,750
And right now, we have to focus on stopping Bauer

187
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,350
before he finds that recording. 

188
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,090
No. 

189
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,120
You have to focus on it. 

190
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,450
Why haven't the analysts finished the hourlies?

191
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,120
They're still getting up to speed on CTU's protocols. 

192
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,890
We knew this wasn't going to be a seamless transition. 

193
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,920
Sometimes I wonder if it was even a necessary one. 

194
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,990
Karen...

195
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,450
CTU's performance today has been

196
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,090
considerably less than stellar. 

197
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,550
Dozens of people have been killed. 

198
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,790
And they weren't even able

199
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,290
to prevent an attack on themselves. 

200
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,650
Do you really believe, under the circumstances, 

201
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,190
that we could have done any better?

202
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,090
Ms. Hayes?

203
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,990
The president is on line one. 

204
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,820
Put him through to Bill Buchanan's office, 

205
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,050
I'll be working out of there from now on. 

206
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,990
And have Medical notify me as soon as Bierko

207
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,650
has regained consciousness. 

208
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,750
Miles. 

209
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,820
Yes, Mr. President?

210
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,450
Karen. 

211
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,620
Do you know where Jack Bauer is?

212
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,790
Not at the moment, sir. 

213
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,390
He was due back here 30 minutes ago

214
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,020
to lead the Bierko interrogation. 

215
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,350
He's gone off grid. 

216
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,950
I'm not surprised. 

217
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,320
Karen, I'm issuing
an executive order

218
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,090
for the immediate apprehension and arrest of Jack Bauer. 

219
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,920
I want you to run point on this, 

220
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,420
and I want you to make this CTU's top priority. 

221
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,020
Yes, sir. 

222
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,490
For purposes of the warrant, 

223
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,620
I'll need to know what Bauer's being charged with. 

224
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,220
His role in the assassination of President David Palmer. 

225
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,650
But I understood that he'd been exonerated

226
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,820
of that charge, sir. 

227
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,490
You, yourself, reinstated his credentials. 

228
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,550
I know, but I didn't have all the facts then. 

229
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,150
Some new evidence has come to light. 

230
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,150
New evidence?

231
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,520
Yes. 

232
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,850
I'm looking at it right now, 

233
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,550
and I will forward it to you at the appropriate time. 

234
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,690
Yes, sir. 

235
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,050
Karen. 

236
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,150
Obviously, this is a very sensitive matter, 

237
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,090
and for now I would like you to treat

238
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,620
the origin of this warrant as confidential. 

239
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,550
Understood, sir. 

240
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,150
Put out an alert on Jack Bauer

241
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,250
to all federal law enforcement agencies and NSA. 

242
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,650
I'll also get military the warrant...

243
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,550
they have more men on the street than anyone. 

244
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,750
I don't like this. 

245
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,420
Pulling our resources off finding Christopher Henderson

246
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,650
to go after Jack Bauer without knowing the evidence?

247
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,690
It's a direct order from the president. 

248
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,490
You know, if we really want to find Bauer, 

249
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,750
we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help. 

250
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,390
Starting with Audrey Raines. 

251
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,220
What's this?

252
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,050
Chloe, open it up and make it look like

253
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,220
this is what we're talking about. 

254
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,920
Okay...

255
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,890
Can you get me a secure channel, 

256
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,050
so the calls on my cell phone can't be monitored?

257
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,750
Using a VPN pathway, sure. 

258
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,390
Take somebody about an hour to crack. 

259
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,420
Why? what's going on?

260
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,790
I just spoke with Jack. 

261
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,620
Gardner isn't the one who's behind this. 

262
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,090
It's President Logan. 

263
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,820
What?

264
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,120
Jack is on his way getting proof. 

265
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,490
I'm leaving now to go help him. 

266
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,050
Take a CTU walkie. 

267
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,520
Audrey. 

268
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,590
It's a warrant for Jack's arrest. 

269
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,590
It's starting. 

270
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,720
What do we do?

271
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,290
Heading out?

272
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,220
Yes, I'm going to try to grab

273
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,420
a couple hours of sleep. 

274
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,450
I came to talk

275
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,850
to both of you about the warrant. 

276
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,750
Well, let's start with why the hell it was issued. 

277
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,890
There's new evidence implicating Jack in David Palmer's

278
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,050
- assassination. - That's ridiculous. 

279
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,150
I was there when the assassin confessed. 

280
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,720
All you have to do is check the log. 

281
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,520
I know about the logs, Chloe. 

282
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,990
My orders are to bring Jack in. 

283
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,820
New evidence?

284
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,520
Have you seen it?

285
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,690
It's forthcoming. 

286
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,420
Who ordered this, Karen?

287
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,950
I'm not at liberty to discuss that. 

288
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,050
When was the last time you spoke with Jack?

289
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,050
About an hour ago. 

290
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,350
We haven't had contact since. 

291
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,150
I hope I don't have to remind either one of you

292
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,650
that you have a legal obligation

293
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,920
to notify me if Jack contacts you. 

294
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,250
Look, I know this may seem odd to the both of you...

295
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,220
frankly, it does to me...

296
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,320
but let's remember it's in everyone's best interest

297
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,890
to bring Jack in peacefully. 

298
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,250
Have a good night. 

299
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,820
Thank you. 

300
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,290
Harris. 

301
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,290
Valerie?

302
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,320
Audrey's on her way. 

303
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,620
What's your status?

304
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,550
We're placing the transponder

305
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,820
on Audrey's car right now. 

306
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,120
Good. 

307
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,620
There won't be many cars on the road, 

308
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,290
so use the tracker and stay out of sight. 

309
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,390
Will do. 

310
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,390
We don't want anything to stop Audrey

311
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,250
from leading us to Bauer. 

312
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,390
That's the house. 

313
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,990
Okay. 

314
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,450
What's the bank manager's name?

315
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,720
Carl Mossman. 

316
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,350
You got your gun?

317
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,120
Yeah, but we don't need them for this, do we?

318
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,850
He's not going to let into his bank

319
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,120
in the middle of the night

320
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,550
unless he thinks he has to. 

321
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,950
Jack, why don't we just try

322
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,520
telling him the truth?

323
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,920
Would you believe it? The only way we're going to have

324
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,390
his full compliance is if he's scared. 

325
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,120
If you're uncomfortable with that, you should stay here. 

326
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,720
Damn it. They've got a magnetic alarm. 

327
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,890
We're in. 

328
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,290
... that will take place within the hour. 

329
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,150
At that time, President Logan is scheduled

330
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,220
to make a statement to the American people

331
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,790
about the successful resolution of today's terrorist threat. 

332
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,290
Did you hear something?

333
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,350
Like what?

334
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,920
I don't know. 

335
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,720
Carl?

336
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,790
Hang on. 

337
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,420
- Carl? - I'll be right back. 

338
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,690
Don't you move. 

339
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,320
Rose, call the police...!

340
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,050
Cover him. 

341
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,320
Put the phone down. 

342
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,620
Put the phone down now!

343
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,650
Bring him in here!

344
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,950
Just stay calm, and everything will be fine. 

345
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,620
Oh my God. Carl...

346
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,490
Take a seat on the bed. 

347
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,190
Okay, look, our money and jewelry's in floor safe in the closet. 

348
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,120
We're not interested in that. 

349
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,150
You're gonna get us into your bank. 

350
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,920
I can't do that. 

351
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,120
It's not that I won't. I can't. 

352
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,250
The alarm system and the vault only allow entry

353
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,190
- during business hours.  - Don't lie to me. 

354
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,620
Every bank has procedures

355
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,750
to allow access during an emergency. 

356
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,990
Hey! No, no!

357
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,890
I'll take you to the bank. 

358
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,220
Slowly

359
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,750
get up, get dressed. 

360
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,450
Go on. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. 

361
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,550
I want four of your neckties. 

362
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,150
Tie her up to the chair. 

363
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,690
Ankles and wrists. Make sure she doesn't move. 

364
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,290
Come on. Yes, hi. This is Audrey Raines. 

365
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,420
I need to speak with Secretary Heller, please. 

366
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,590
Mr. Secretary, there's a call coming in for you

367
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,390
on an over-air encrypted channel. 

368
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,490
It's your daughter. 

369
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,120
Audrey, is everything okay?

370
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,150
Hi. Uh, yes, I'm okay. 

371
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,350
Dad, I need your help. 

372
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,650
Is this a secure line?

373
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,020
Very secure. 

374
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,120
Is this about the arrest order for Jack?

375
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,850
I was just informed. 

376
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Dad, I can't go into details right now, but Jack is innocent. 

377
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,990
He's being set up. 

378
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,620
Set up by whom?

379
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,750
What the hell is going on, Audrey?

380
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,920
You call me this morning, to tell me that Jack's alive. 

381
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,920
Now I get word he's a suspect again

382
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,450
in the Palmer assassination. 

383
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,790
Dad, I can't talk to you about it right now. 

384
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,490
I need to see you in person. 

385
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,490
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles?

386
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,650
Dad, I would never ask you to do this

387
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
if it wasn't extremely important. 

388
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,250
All right, yes. 

389
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,790
Thank you. 

390
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,650
The closest airport is Van Nuys. 

391
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,290
We're about an hour out. 

392
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,750
I'll call you on final approach. 

393
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,590
Okay. Thank you. I'll see you there. 

394
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,720
I'll see you. 

395
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,890
Bye. 

396
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,720
Doug!

397
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,450
Yes, sir. 

398
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,490
We have to make a stop in L. A. 

399
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,590
And keep it off the manifest. 

400
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,050
Yes, sir. 

401
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,720
Pull over. 

402
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,390
She stopped. 

403
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,390
Corner of Alderton and Davis. 

404
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,020
It's a gas station. 

405
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,150
O'Brian. 

406
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,150
Chloe, it's me. 

407
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,890
Hold on. 

408
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,490
Okay, switched over to my own VPN. 

409
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,790
Now they can't monitor either end of the conversation. 

410
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,690
- Do you have the walkie?  - Yeah. Hang on. 

411
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,890
All right, what do I do with it?

412
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,170
Tune to proprietary channel 17, 

413
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,040
turn the sensitivity up all the way. 

414
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,070
See if you pick up a pilot signal. 

415
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,940
Okay, hold on. 

416
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,000
Wow. Do you hear that?

417
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,600
That's what I figured... they put a tracker on you. 

418
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,400
I found it. All right, Chloe, I got it. Thank you. 

419
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,670
Audrey, you need to disable your phone by taking the battery out as soon as you can. 

420
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,470
All right, I have to wait

421
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,500
- for a call from Jack and then I will.  - Okay. 

422
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,350
Yes. 

423
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,820
Sir, it's almost time. 

424
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,550
Yes. 

425
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,090
The press conference. 

426
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,490
That's right. 

427
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,720
Mr. President, 

428
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,250
if I could have a moment...

429
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,820
Uh, I should be done

430
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,050
with my statement shortly, Hal. 

431
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,520
This is potentially time sensitive, sir. 

432
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,320
I just got an alert that a warrant

433
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,020
has been issued for Jack Bauer. 

434
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,190
Thank you, Aaron. 

435
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,520
Yes, sir. 

436
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,790
What about the warrant?

437
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,390
Well, it's an executive branch warrant. 

438
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,790
I didn't issue it, so it must have come from you. 

439
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,260
That's right, it came from me. 

440
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,990
Well, as you've put me in charge

441
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,220
of overseeing CTU and the Homeland Security transfer, 

442
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,420
don't you think you should have discussed it

443
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,790
with me first?

444
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,560
I appreciate everything you've done today, Hal, 

445
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,960
but the last time I checked, I was still Commander in Chief. 

446
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Of course, Mr. President, but Jack Bauer?

447
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,820
It doesn't make any sense. 

448
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,420
We should be treating that man like a hero. 

449
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,760
I've gone over the logs. 

450
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,160
Walt Cummings has confessed

451
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,720
that he arranged Palmer's assassination, framing Bauer. 

452
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,320
Well, clearly, 

453
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,820
Cummings was protecting Bauer. 

454
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,460
- Why?  - I don't know why. 

455
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,790
But the fact remains I have received confirmation

456
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,620
from Intelligence sources

457
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,220
that Jack Bauer was, without question, the shooter. 
461 

458
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,260
- Which sources?  - That's enough!

459
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,990
I'm not going to stand here and have my orders challenged. 

460
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,490
You have concerns, Hal. 

461
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,520
We'll sort this all out

462
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,260
once Bauer's in custody. 

463
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,860
Does that suit you?

464
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,660
Yes, sir. 

465
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Good. 

466
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,360
Mom?

467
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,890
Amy?

468
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,320
Sweetheart, it's okay. 

469
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,220
Hold on. I'm coming. 

470
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,790
Hold on, sweetheart, 
I'm coming. 

471
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,260
Mom! Mom!

472
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,460
Mommy. 

473
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,990
911. What's your emergency?

474
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,990
My mom... she passed out. 

475
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,560
I can't wake her up. 

476
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,590
Calm down. Tell me your name. 

477
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,820
Amy. My mom's name is Evelyn. 

478
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,220
What's your mom's last name?

479
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,660
Martin. 

480
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,420
Her name's Evelyn Martin. 

481
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,790
All right, honey, now tell me where you are. 

482
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,090
Yeah. 

483
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Sir, a call is coming in to the 911 operator

484
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,160
from a Motel 6 on Porter Valley Drive

485
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,660
requesting medical assistance for an Evelyn Martin. 

486
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,820
My fellow Americans, it is with great relief that I announce

487
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:33,320
that the terrorist threat our nation faced today is over. 

488
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,220
More than an hour ago, federal counter-terrorist agents, under my direction, 

489
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,250
thwarted the latest attack on innocent civilians, 

490
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:44,590
the nature of which was kept secret due to national security. 

491
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,590
This was done with the public's best interest in mind. 

492
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,350
He really did it. 

493
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,120
Ma'am?

494
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,220
Charles. 

495
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,990
He stopped the terrorists, the treaty was signed. 

496
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,590
He said he would ride out this crisis, 

497
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,590
and everything would be okay. 

498
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,650
And it is. 

499
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,450
I should have trusted him. 

500
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,950
Yes, ma'am. 

501
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,320
What's wrong, Aaron?

502
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,350
I'm just a little battle worn. 

503
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,990
They attempted to derail the historic accord...

504
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,050
Jack, why are we stopping here?

505
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,820
There's too many military checkpoints in the area. 

506
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,020
They'll stop our car. 

507
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,920
We have to go the rest of the way on foot. 

508
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,150
How far is the bank from here?

509
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,750
About a quarter of a mile that way. 

510
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,450
Be right back. 

511
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Aaron, it's Jack. 

512
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,350
Jack, are you aware President Logan's

513
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
issued a warrant for your arrest for your role

514
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,450
in David Palmer's assassination?

515
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,050
No, but that makes sense. 

516
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,090
The Vice President's not the one who's behind this, is he?

517
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,350
No, it's Logan. 

518
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,290
They're going to have every agency

519
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,520
and the military looking for you. 

520
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,820
And Logan is the only one who can call them off. 

521
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,420
As soon as we have the evidence in hand, 

522
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,490
We're gonna pass it off to Secretary of Defense Heller. 

523
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,850
After that, it's not gonna matter. 

524
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,850
Is there anything I can do for you, Jack?

525
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,790
Keep your eyes open and watch your back. 

526
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,450
Will do. 

527
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,890
Get out of the car. 

528
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,150
Come on. 

529
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,450
Let's go. 

530
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,450
Move, move. 

531
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,050
Take cover, go!

532
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,650
Not a word. 

533
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,990
Ms. Hayes, Valerie Harris is on line two for you.

534
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,390
She says it's urgent. 

535
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,420
Valerie, what's happening?

536
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,250
- We lost Audrey Raines.  - What?

537
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,850
She found the tracker and transferred it

538
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,850
to a DWP truck at a gas station. 

539
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,990
Damn it. How did she find it?

540
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,620
- She's got no field experience.  - I don't know. 

541
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,990
The only reason we discovered it

542
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,120
is the DWP guy stopped to check a faulty power line. 

543
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,420
All right, hold your position

544
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,720
and wait for my instructions. 

545
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,020
Will do. 

546
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,820
Papazian. 

547
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,790
Audrey Raines ditched her transponder. 

548
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,450
I need you to redirect satellite surveillance and track her. 

549
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,620
I can redirect CalTrans and maybe one SAT-LINK, 

550
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,390
but the rest are dedicated to finding Bauer. 

551
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,950
Following Audrey should lead us right to Bauer. 

552
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,650
Just get it done and tell me

553
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,050
- when you've got something.  - I'm on it. 

554
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,950
Against the wall. 

555
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,890
Watch him. 

556
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,590
Just do what he says, Carl. 

557
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,390
- Do what he says and you'll be home before you know it.  - Right.

558
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,520
What's the emergency procedure

559
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,050
to enter the bank? I have 30 seconds

560
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,550
to put my key in the alarm panel, 

561
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,790
then I enter my code. 

562
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,420
You enter the wrong code and alert the police, 

563
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,950
all I have to do is make one call, your wife is dead.

564
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,290
- You understand me?  - Yes. 

565
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,420
Let's go. 

566
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,950
Where's the vault?

567
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,950
Take us around the back, stay away from the windows. 

568
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,620
How do I open it?

569
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,950
There's a 12-digit code, but it's a timed unlock procedure, 

570
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,650
which allows enough time for the police to arrive in the event

571
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,920
that someone should trigger the silent alarm. 

572
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,490
Write the code down for me. 

573
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,990
Take him over to one of the desks, keep an eye on him. 

574
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,620
I know you. 

575
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,720
- No, you don't.  - Yes, I do.

576
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,620
You're David Palmer's brother. 

577
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,820
I saw you on TV this morning. 

578
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,190
You were there when he was shot. 

579
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,250
Now, what the hell are you doing in my bank?

580
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,620
And who is he?

581
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,290
Listen, I know it's absurd to ask you

582
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,090
to trust me under these circumstances, 

583
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,220
but believe me, you don't want to know. 

584
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,550
Oh, come on. 

585
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,890
You threaten me with a gun, you kidnap me, 

586
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,150
you're robbing my bank. 

587
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,990
Now, I deserve to know what the hell is going on here. 

588
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,520
Fine. 

589
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,250
Jack and I believe there's evidence inside

590
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,550
of one of your safety deposit boxes that's gonna prove

591
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,520
who was behind the assassination of my brother, okay?

592
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,150
Wayne. 

593
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,290
What's going on?

594
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,150
What do you want me to say, Jack?

595
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,090
- He recognized me.  - It's all right. 

596
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,350
Mr. Mossman, 

597
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,190
how long is the delay before the vault opens?

598
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,650
Five minutes. 

599
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,020
Is that true what he said? Is that why you two are here?

600
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,420
Yes. 

601
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,050
Why didn't you just wait till morning, get a subpoena?

602
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,520
The people that are behind this will never let it go that far. 

603
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,220
They've already tried to kill me twice tonight, Carl. 

604
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,820
And they're gonna try again the very first chance they get. 

605
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,420
Mom. 

606
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,690
Miss Martin, 

607
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,250
you're in shock. 

608
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,690
But you're going to be okay. 

609
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,690
You know my name?

610
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,520
Where's Bauer?

611
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,790
You did?

612
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,330
Well, that's good. 

613
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,660
I'm glad. 

614
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,490
I'll get back to you. 

615
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,690
I thought you went to bed. 

616
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,390
No. 

617
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,190
I, uh, watched you with the press. 

618
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,530
Well, um, that was Morry, 

619
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,330
and he thought it went pretty well. 

620
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,390
Good. 

621
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,890
But that doesn't begin to describe it. 

622
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,230
Charles, you have had to deal with

623
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:09,230
more crisis today than any president in an entire term.

624
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,390
You...

625
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,330
were magnificent. 

626
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,630
Magnificent. 

627
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,560
Well, I like the sound of that. 

628
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,160
Especially coming from you. 

629
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,990
I'm so proud of you. 

630
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,560
I hope I haven't embarrassed you too much as your First Lady. 

631
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,760
Stop. No. 

632
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,760
Don't be ridiculous. 

633
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,490
I mean, you walked up to the edge a couple times,

634
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
but nobody noticed. 

635
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,260
I'll try to find a compliment in there somewhere. 

636
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,090
I'm sorry, Marty. 

637
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,290
I didn't...

638
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,130
Wow.

639
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,890
I was so selfish today. 

640
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,890
No. 

641
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,330
You had so much on your plate, 

642
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,230
you didn't need me piling more on. 

643
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,230
No, I...

644
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,530
Please don't say anything. 

645
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,730
Just accept my apology. 

646
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,060
I do. 

647
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,930
I do, I accept your apology. 

648
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,760
I have to take this privately. 

649
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,030
- Who is it?  - Now, what difference

650
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,360
does it make? Please, Marty. 

651
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,060
I thought the crisis was over. 

652
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,060
I thought you and I...

653
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,890
All right. 

654
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,430
Yes. 

655
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,330
We know where Bauer is. 

656
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,760
Evelyn gave him up. 

657
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,130
Well, then take care of it. 

658
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,430
My men are heading there now. 

659
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,490
Good. 

660
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,160
Let me know when it's done. 

661
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,730
I'm sorry, honey. 

662
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,160
I guess I haven't gotten used to the idea that...

663
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,390
that the crisis is over. 

664
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,890
When what's done?

665
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,530
- What?  - You just said, 

666
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,790
"Let me know when it's done. "

667
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,830
Oh, that was Jamey. 

668
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,060
I asked her to write me a radio speech

669
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,630
for tomorrow morning. 

670
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,660
We found Audrey Raines. 

671
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,860
Where?

672
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,760
She's heading north toward Mulholland. 

673
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,360
Connect me with Harris. 

674
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,830
Harris. 

675
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,860
Valerie, we have a fix on Raines. 

676
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,730
She's heading toward the Sepulveda Pass, 

677
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,990
coming up on Mulholland. 

678
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,960
Copy that. 

679
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,060
Let's go. 

680
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,430
Chloe?

681
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,830
Do you have a minute?

682
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,130
No. 

683
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,990
What is it?

684
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,290
I was assigned to log all satellite

685
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,690
and ground video activity, 

686
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,460
but part of the vector is locked out. 

687
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,530
Locked out? What do you mean?

688
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,960
I mean, someone's taken control of one

689
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,890
of the satellites using a class one priority override.

690
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,230
Do you know anything about it?

691
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,260
No. 

692
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,790
- I'll look into it.  - Thanks. 

693
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,930
Crap. 

694
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,890
All points are covered, sir. 

695
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,130
The perimeter is secure. 

696
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,630
Do you have a visual?

697
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,960
- I did, briefly.  - All right, listen. 

698
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,760
You tell your men the instant, and I mean the instant

699
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,890
that Bauer steps outside that bank building

700
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,290
you take him down. 

701
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,460
Then, kill the others and secure the recording. 

702
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,560
Which one is it?

703
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,530
Twenty-three. 

704
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,390
Mr. Palmer, 

705
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,660
I admired your brother a great deal. 

706
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,730
He was a great man. 

707
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,790
Thank you. 

708
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,030
It had to be done, sir. 

709
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,090
I decide what needs to be done, Mr. Henderson. 

710
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,160
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer. 

711
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,390
Palmer was nosing around. 

712
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,960
He'd have found out about your involvement. 

713
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,760
For God's sake, sir, he called your wife. 

714
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,730
I can handle my wife. 

715
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,630
Right now, my concern is keeping this operation

716
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,490
from collapsing like a house of cards. 

717
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,260
- You're protected, sir.  - That's president Logan's voice. 

718
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,330
Every thread ends with Cummings. 

719
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,490
He thinks he's running this, 

720
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,360
And you need to keep playing it that way. 

721
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,590
I know my part, Mr. Henderson. 

722
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,330
You just do as you're told. 

723
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,330
- Oh, my God.  - We got what we need. 

724
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,790
Mr. Mossman, 

725
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,360
I'm sorry we put you and your wife through this. 

726
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,130
It'll be safer for you to stay here now. 

727
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,430
- Could you please let us out?  - Like to help if I can. 

728
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:16,060
- I've come this far.  - We're gonna need to borrow your car a little longer.

729
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,160
Sure, it's insured. 

730
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,530
Wait. There's someone inside. 

731
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,190
Mr. Mossman, get back in the vault now. 

732
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,290
Is there any other way out of here besides the front door?

733
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,790
No, front door only... security reasons. 

734
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,330
Damn it. 

735
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,590
Both of you stay here. 

736
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,690
I'll be right back. 

737
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,860
Henderson's men are taking up positions. 

738
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,890
There's no other way out... we're gonna have to turn ourselves in. 

739
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,090
They didn't come here to arrest us; they came here to kill us. 

740
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,690
What are they waiting for?

741
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,890
All the windows are bulletproof. 

742
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,060
They're waiting for us to leave the building. 

743
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,990
So what are you gonna do?

744
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,660
How do you trip the silent alarm?

745
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,560
I have a key, but you trip that alarm, LAPD

746
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,160
will be here within a few minutes. 

747
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,830
That's exactly what I want. 

748
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,390
Henderson's men outnumber us. 

749
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,430
- We leave this building now, we lose.  - Jack, if you call the cops, 

750
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,030
they're gonna get the recording when we're taken into custody. 

751
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,660
We won't be taken into custody. 

752
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,490
As soon as Henderson finds out the LAPD have arrived, 

753
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,190
he's gonna have his men engage them. 

754
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,130
He doesn't want the police to have the recording any more

755
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,890
- than he wants us to have it.  - So they start shooting at each other. 

756
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,360
- How does that help us?  - We have to try and use that as a diversion. 

757
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,860
It's our only way out. 

758
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:51,290
Trigger the alarm. 

759
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,270
Valerie. 

760
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,300
The feed should be coming through to your laptop now. 

761
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,600
I've got her. 

762
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,000
She's heading west on Chandler. 

763
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,030
- How close are you to Audrey's car?  - About two miles.

764
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,300
Close the gap to one mile. 

765
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,530
Affirmative. 

766
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,900
Something's wrong. 

767
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,370
The feed's breaking up. 

768
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,470
We're experiencing the same difficulty with our signal... hold on.

769
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,830
- what is going on?  - I don't know. 

770
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,870
The satellite's positioned correctly. 

771
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,930
I'm tracing the corruption. 

772
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,200
It's the server. 

773
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,470
What is it?

774
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,700
O'Brian's gone. 

775
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,570
What were you doing?

776
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,930
What?

777
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,100
What were you doing?

778
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,830
Are you kidding?

779
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,430
If you really want the details, I'll write you a report. 

780
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,570
Let's go, now. 

781
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,270
The police should be here any minute. 

782
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,530
Mr. Mossman, like I said before, 

783
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,200
it might be safer for you to stay here in the bank.

784
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,600
No, these guys find me, 

785
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,800
they assume I know about the recording, 

786
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,470
they'd probably kill me, right?

787
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,200
I'll take my chances with you. 

788
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,570
I want you to stay as close to Mr. Palmer as you can. 

789
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,230
I'll provide cover fire. 

790
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,270
Once we leave the bank, you break left. 

791
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,470
Yes, sir. Cooper, what's your status?

792
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,300
No change, they still haven't come out. 

793
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,970
Must have seen you, damn it. 

794
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,370
Tell your men to move in immediately. 

795
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,730
The cops are here. 

796
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,100
We can't let them have Bauer, take 'em down. 

797
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,300
Yes, sir. 

798
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,900
This is LAPD!

799
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,270
Drop your weapons!

800
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,430
Engage! Engage!

801
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,600
Let's go. 

802
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,870
Need to go to the police car now... move!

803
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,530
He's been hit!

804
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,930
How is he doing?

805
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,730
He's dead. 

806
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,730
Damn it. 

807
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,900
Jack, where are you?

808
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,130
I'm on my way to you. 

809
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,370
Did your father agree to meet?

810
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,030
Yes, he's landing at Van Nuys Airport
in about 15 minutes. 

811
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,570
I'm there now. 

812
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,670
Good, we got the evidence. 

813
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,830
Have you listened to it?

814
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,200
Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan. 

815
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,670
You understand what this means. 

816
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,970
We're talking about taking down

817
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,700
the President of the United States. 

818
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


819
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,690
Evelyn, I need you to stay focused. 

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,320
The recording of the phone call that you made between President Logan

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,220
and Henderson is in a safety deposit box.  Which bank?

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,760
City trust and savings in Agoura Hills. 

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,890
Jack knows there's no point in going public till he has that evidence in his hand. 

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,030
None of this should have happened. 

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,050
This whole thing was planned to make our country safer. 

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,820
And it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill David Palmer. 

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,530
We have to focus on stopping Bauer before he finds that recording. 

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,440
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediate apprehension and arrest of Jack Bauer. 

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,070
I want you to run point on this and I want you to make this CTU's top priority. 

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,150
Understood, sir. 

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,980
You know, if we really want to find Bauer, 

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,130
we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help, 

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,030
starting with Audrey Raines. 

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,830
Don't fill your father in on the particulars. 

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,970
Just set up the meeting. 

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,210
I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording. 

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,650
I need to see you in person. 

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,480
Can you reroute your plane to los angeles?

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,580
All right, yes. 

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,930
I'll see you there. 

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,320
Jack, are you aware President Logan's issued a warrant for your arrest?

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,010
The vice President's not the one who's behind this, is he?

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,560
No.  It's Logan. 

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,860
As soon as we have the evidence in hand, 

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,730
we're going to pass it off to secretary of defense Heller. 

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,120
It had to be done, sir. 

29
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,550
I decide what needs to be done, Mr.  Henderson. 

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,820
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer. 

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,890
You know what we need. 

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,720
The instant that Bauer steps outside that bank building, you take him down. 

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,630
Kill the others and secure the recording. 

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,250
we got the evidence. 

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,270
Have you listened to it?

36
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,190
Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan. 

37
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,560
We're talking about taking down the President of the united states. 

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,970
This checkpoint is just one of many that have been in place for several hours now. 

39
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,320
Despite his announcement that los angeles is no longer under threat of attack, 

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,210
President Logan has ordered that martial law

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,770
remain in effect. 

42
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,510
While the move has drawn criticism from lawmakers and civil rights advocates, 

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,470
the President is defending his decision as a necessary precaution. 

44
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,730
he's citing the need...

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,690
- yes.   - It's me. 

46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,990
Is Bauer dead?

47
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,960
Not yet, Mr.  President. 

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,160
You said your men had him. 

49
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,710
Bauer triggered the bank alarm. 

50
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,900
The authorities came before our men could get to him. 

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,520
Bauer used the cover of the firefight to slip away. 

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,920
He has the recording?

53
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,160
Yes, sir. 

54
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,680
That evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death. 

55
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,340
Only if he gets it to someone who can do something about it. 

56
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,020
We'll have Bauer before that happens. 

57
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,020
How?

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,790
Mr.  President, you've established direct control over CTU, 

59
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,750
and CTU is heading up the search effort for Bauer. 

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,600
You're putting an awful lot of faith in their ability. 

61
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,160
This city is locked down. 

62
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,690
CTU will find Bauer, and when they do, 

63
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,200
make sure you're the first to know so my men can intercept. 

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,430
yes, Mr.  President?

65
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,970
Karen Hayes at CTU.  Put it through to my office. 

66
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,670
We're sifting satellite and caltrans video for Audrey Raines's vehicle. 

67
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,810
I've distributed her file photo to military checkpoints throughout the city. 

68
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,430
If she used her DOD credentials at any of them, 

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,430
there should be a record. 

70
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,410
Well, I hope we're not wasting our resources on raines

71
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,250
when we don't even know she's helping Bauer. 

72
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,860
Karen, she dumped the tracker. 

73
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,050
There's a reason she doesn't want to be followed. 

74
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,200
Miss hayes, the President's on line one. 

75
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,980
Yes, Mr.  President. 

76
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,080
Where are we, ms.  Hayes?

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,450
Still running active manhunts on both Jack Bauer and christopher Henderson. 

78
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,380
I told you to prioritize Bauer. 

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,700
I have, sir.  I've allocated my resources accordingly. 

80
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,620
If David Palmer's killer is still at large when the morning news cycle begins, 

81
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,930
then all the success we've had handling these terrorists will be undermined. 

82
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,920
I will find Bauer, sir. 

83
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,140
You let me know the moment you do. 

84
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,170
Yes, Mr.  President. 

85
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,870
Bauer, right?

86
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,530
Audrey Raines.

87
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,980
She knows where he is, 

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,350
and those protocols aren't going to be enough to track her. 

89
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,500
You still think Chloe helped Audrey break surveillance?

90
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,010
I'm sure of it. 

91
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,590
Remember, 

92
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,470
Audrey insisted Chloe be assigned to her. 

93
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,700
Then we need to confront chloe. 

94
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,220
No, no, no, no, no.  She'll just deny it. 

95
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,170
There's a way we can use her to find Bauer. 

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,000
It's all right.  It's him. 

97
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,400
Bill, over here. 

98
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,460
Jack.

99
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,870
Bill Buchanan,

100
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,290
Wayne Palmer.

101
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,320
Sorry about your brother. 

102
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,940
What the hell's going on, Jack?

103
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,840
The military authority, 

104
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,800
every law enforcement agency across this country has a warrant for my arrest. 

105
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,160
What for?

106
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,970
Killing David Palmer. 

107
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,020
That's impossible.  We cleared you this morning. 

108
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,850
I'm being set up again, this time by President Logan. 

109
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,780
He was complicit in David Palmer's assassination. 

110
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,080
My god, you're serious. 

111
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,080
Logan's using the military to try and stop me from exposing him. 

112
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,640
Mr.  Buchanan, we have the evidence:

113
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,320
A digital recording of a conversation made between President Logan and christopher Henderson. 

114
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,170
I need to get the recording to secretary Heller. 

115
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,050
He's gonna take it to the attorney general, 

116
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,330
and they'll file for the warrant. 

117
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,090
But until then, Wayne's a target. 

118
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,610
I need you to take him somewhere safe. 

119
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,060
Of course I will. 

120
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,610
Where are you gonna meet Heller?

121
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,930
Van Nuys airport. 

122
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,600
Yeah. 

123
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,740
Jack, my father landed.  Where are you?

124
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,880
I just dropped Wayne Palmer off with Buchanan. 

125
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,370
I'm on my way to the airport now. 

126
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,730
All right, I'm on the north side of the emergency runway at hangar 112. 

127
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,780
I'll be there in a few minutes. 

128
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,110
All right, hurry. 

129
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,350
Dad. 

130
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,660
- Hi, sweetheart.   - Hi. 

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,740
Thank you so much for doing this. 

132
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,370
Well, I don't know what it is I'm doing, so don't thank me yet. 

133
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,780
These men in your security detail, do you trust them?

134
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,250
With my life. 

135
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,830
Dad, I need to be sure that they are loyal to you. 

136
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,970
What's going on?

137
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,230
Dad, I will tell you, but only you. 

138
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,610
Stay here. 

139
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,160
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark. 

140
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
Tell me what this is all about. 

141
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,950
I promise, I will. 

142
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,680
I just need a minute. 

143
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,010
Mr.  Secretary. 

144
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,900
What the hell are you doing here?

145
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,190
He's a fugitive. 

146
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,390
Every law enforcement agency in this state is looking for him. 

147
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,380
He's innocent. 

148
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,130
Then why don't you turn yourself in?

149
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,420
Mr.  Secretary, I swear to you, 

150
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,990
I had nothing to do with David Palmer's assassination. 

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,930
I'd like to believe you, Jack, 

152
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,260
but you're acting like a criminal. 

153
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,750
I don't have a choice; they're setting me up. 

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,020
Mr.  Secretary, I only need you for a few minutes. 

155
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,690
I need to show you something, 

156
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,100
but privately, 

157
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,710
inside the building, please. 

158
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,780
Thank you, sir. 

159
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,670
It had to be done, sir. 

160
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,200
I decide what needs to be done, Mr.  Henderson. 

161
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,500
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer. 

162
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,330
- Palmer was nosing around.   - President Logan?

163
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,830
And a man named Christopher Henderson. 

164
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,360
He'd have found out about your involvement. 

165
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,530
For god's sake, sir, he called your wife. 

166
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,610
I can handle my wife. 

167
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,760
Right now, my concern is keeping

168
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,600
this operation from collapsing like a house of cards. 

169
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,630
You're protected, sir. 

170
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,610
Every thread ends with cummings. 

171
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,840
He thinks he's running this, and you need to keep playing it that way. 

172
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,800
I know my part, Mr.  Henderson. 

173
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,470
You just do as you're told. 

174
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,530
President Logan supplied the terrorists with the sentox nerve gas. 

175
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,440
What?

176
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,310
His plan was to deploy the nerve gas en route to Moscow. 

177
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,210
That way, he could expose the terrorists and use them

178
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,110
as an excuse to invoke the military terms of the agreement that he made earlier with suvarov. 

179
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,100
This was all in an effort to gain control of the oil supply in central Asia. 

180
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,920
David Palmer found out about it, and that's why they killed him. 

181
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,440
How do you know that recording hasn't been fabricated?

182
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,780
I trust the source. 

183
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,670
Mr.  Secretary, I promise you, this will stand up under scrutiny. 

184
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,650
I wish I could say I was surprised, but I'm not. 

185
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,050
I watched Charles Logan

186
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,350
rise on the tide of his own ambition. 

187
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,640
I was terrified when he took the oath. 

188
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,350
Sir, I'm very sorry that I had to involve you, 

189
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,720
but I needed someone who had access to hand-deliver this to the attorney general.

190
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,600
So you contacted me. 

191
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,990
You're the only one I could trust. 

192
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,980
All right, then. 

193
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,360
Thank you, sir. 

194
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,500
You need to go with your father. 

195
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,410
He's going to need someone to corroborate the evidence to the attorney general. 

196
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,380
What about you?

197
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,570
I'm going to go dark

198
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,070
until the Attorney General comes forward. 

199
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,600
I'll call Buchanan; I'll let him know what's happening. 

200
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,830
All right.  Jack, everything's going to be okay now. 

201
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,430
Yeah.  Go. 

202
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,970
Okay. 

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,530
Jack, one more thing. 

204
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,170
What, sir?

205
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,400
Dad, what are you doing?!

206
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,700
Secure my daughter. 

207
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,400
You're playing a dangerous game here, Jack, 

208
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,070
and you're playing it wrong. 

209
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,630
Turning Logan's crime into a public spectacle

210
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,900
will not bring back David Palmer. 

211
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,630
It'll tear this nation apart. 

212
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,830
You're not only destroying the president, 

213
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,870
you'll be destroying the presidency. 

214
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,570
The collateral damage of the truth

215
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,370
will cripple this nation. 

216
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,530
So what are you going to do? Bury the evidence?

217
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,570
No. 

218
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,100
You're coming with me, Audrey, 

219
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,930
and we'll use the evidence to get Logan

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,200
to step down quietly. 

221
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,700
Once he's gone, we'll have a chance

222
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,530
to set things right again. 

223
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,930
Doug, I'm trusting you

224
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,070
to keep this item safe. 

225
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,130
Audrey, are you coming with me or not?

226
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,400
Dad, I can't. 

227
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,030
Then secure them both until you hear from me. 

228
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,770
Dad, please, no!

229
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,070
Mr.  Secretary, 

230
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,430
you can't make a deal with him!

231
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,430
You can't trust them!

232
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,850
Excuse me. 

233
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,050
Do you know what's going on in the Situation Room?

234
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,950
- It's some sort of briefing.   - No one told me. 

235
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,320
It's a Class 3.  That's all I know. 

236
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,420
I'm a department head.  I should be in all Class 3s. 

237
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,850
That's all I know. 

238
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,780
Shari, what was that briefing about?

239
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,620
Just a protocol review. 

240
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,650
I don't believe you. 

241
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,420
- Why not?  - 'Cause you're a bad liar. 

242
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,720
Miles just gave me a bunch of busywork

243
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,720
to do in the Archives Room

244
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,950
to keep me out of the briefing. 

245
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,080
Do you ever think there might be a reason

246
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,050
he kept you out?

247
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,580
He thinks I helped Audrey

248
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,250
break her surveillance. 

249
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,380
Is that what it was about?

250
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,820
I've already said too much. 

251
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,320
Please don't ask me any more questions. 

252
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,850
Come on, Shari, 

253
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,120
you owe me. 

254
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,920
I stuck my neck out for you with Miles. 

255
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,480
Tell me what happened in there. 

256
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,180
Miles found Audrey. 

257
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,320
He activated a transponder on her car. 

258
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,720
So they know where she is?

259
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,380
We're running an operational support right now. 

260
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,650
That's what the briefing was about. 

261
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
They sent a tac team

262
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,850
ten minutes ago. 

263
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,750
Please don't tell anyone I said anything. 

264
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,680
Here she comes. 

265
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,050
Damn, she's good. 

266
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,780
She set up a proprietary com channel. 

267
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,950
- How long will it take to track her call?  - Not long. 

268
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
Pick up. 

269
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,680
Somewhere in the Valley. 

270
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,680
Looks like a pay phone. 

271
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,680
I've got the receiving end

272
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,080
narrowed down to a one-mile radius. 

273
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,450
Why isn't Audrey picking up?

274
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,020
Narrowing...

275
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,020
Got it. 

276
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,150
Where?

277
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,780
Van Nuys Airport... the emergency runway

278
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,880
adjacent to the main field. 

279
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,380
Move the tac team out now. 

280
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,580
Van Nuys Airport. 

281
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,550
Miles is forwarding the coordinates. 

282
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,550
Get me the president. 

283
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,550
You said they sent the tac team

284
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,350
ten minutes ago. 

285
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,550
Miles set me up, and you helped. 

286
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,950
You're working

287
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,750
- against us, Chloe.   - You have no idea what you've done. 

288
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,850
Miles said that... 

289
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,220
Miles is an idiot. 

290
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,480
If anyone should know that, it should be you. 

291
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,880
I can't believe you went along with him. 

292
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,450
Please come with us, 

293
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,250
- Ms.  O'Brian.   - Where are we going?

294
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Let's go. 

295
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,980
Mr.  President, I need to remind you that we still don't have

296
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,550
confirmation that Audrey Raines

297
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,780
and Bauer are at the location. 

298
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,550
You'll find out soon enough. 

299
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,350
I'll have the military authority follow up on it. 

300
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,850
- The military?  - Sir, I just dispatched

301
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,080
my tac team. 

302
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,680
Call them back. 

303
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,780
I don't understand... 

304
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,680
Jack Bauer is a very sensitive problem. 

305
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,720
There are political ramifications. 

306
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,780
I've decided to handle him directly. 

307
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,420
And besides, you must have your hands full, 

308
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,780
transitioning CTU to Homeland Security. 

309
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,680
I'll recall my team, sir. 

310
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,580
Good. 

311
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,420
Now the president wants oversight

312
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,680
on the Bauer operation. 

313
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,680
He's the president. 

314
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,480
He can do what he wants. 

315
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,380
Yeah.  CTU thinks they found Bauer. 

316
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,480
Where?

317
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,950
Jack, what if my father's right?

318
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,680
What if he can get Logan to step down quietly?

319
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,880
Maybe that is the best thing for this country. 

320
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,120
These people brokered chemical weapons to terrorists. 

321
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,220
They've killed an ex-president of the United States. 

322
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,450
Logan's not going to make a deal

323
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,850
with your father, and even if he did, 

324
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,850
he wouldn't keep it. 

325
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,150
Henderson wouldn't let him. 

326
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,750
The only thing your father's doing right now

327
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,420
is making himself a target. 

328
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,820
You want to help him?

329
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,950
Help me get the recording back before he speaks to Logan. 

330
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,250
Look, Mike, this isn't me being territorial, 

331
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,750
but if the president wants Jack Bauer, 

332
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,720
why doesn't he let us take care of it?

333
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,750
Now, look, I've been on other things. 

334
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,280
Let me find out what's going on. 

335
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,580
I'll get back to you, Karen. 

336
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,620
Thank you, Mike. 

337
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,750
... Will be lifted within the next two hours,

338
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,380
but the curfew will remain in effect... 

339
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,180
Come in. 

340
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,480
That's only

341
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,120
six hours from now. 

342
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,020
Okay. 

343
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,580
David Palmer's body's being flown back to DC at 7:00 a. m. 

344
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,680
The president and I both want to be there when the coffin's

345
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,480
- put onto the plane.   - That's a good idea. 

346
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,280
Yeah. 

347
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,750
What's up, Mike?

348
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,420
I just got a call from Karen Hayes at CTU. 

349
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,550
Do you know about the president's decision

350
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,250
to pull them off the acquisition of Jack Bauer?

351
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,450
No, but what's the problem?

352
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,980
The problem is it doesn't really make sense. 

353
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,920
Karen's teams are closer. 

354
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,920
They can do it more efficiently. 

355
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,080
Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them

356
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,250
than with a group of military police he doesn't know. 

357
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,580
Well, Karen and her team

358
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,480
have barely gotten CTU back on its feet. 

359
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,250
I'm sure the president just feels more confident

360
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,050
with the military units already in place

361
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,580
because of martial law. 

362
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,280
Well, the military has its hands full, Hal. 

363
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,750
What do you want me to say, Mike?

364
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,180
It's the president's call. 

365
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,950
I can see it both ways. 

366
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,620
Yeah?

367
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,780
Operations. 

368
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,450
Beth, it's Mike Novick. 

369
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,920
Put me through to General Warren, please. 

370
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,080
Yes, sir. 

371
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,380
This is Warren. 

372
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,220
Sir, I have Mike Novick on the line for you. 

373
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,720
Go ahead, Beth. 

374
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,920
He's on. 

375
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,620
What is it, Mike?

376
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,080
General, can you give me an update

377
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,920
on your search for Jack Bauer?

378
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,250
What are you talking about?

379
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,750
The one the president ordered. 

380
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,120
We never received such a call from the president. 

381
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,250
I see. 

382
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,150
- I... I'm sorry to disturb you, General.   - Yes, sir.

383
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,280
You should try to get some rest, 

384
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,250
Mr.  President. 

385
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,750
Yes, I know. 

386
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,380
I should try to get some rest. 

387
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,880
What is it you want, Mike?

388
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,580
I just got off the phone with General Warren, 

389
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,380
who's running military operations

390
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,420
here in Los Angeles. 

391
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,620
Why would you be talking with him?

392
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,150
Karen Hayes

393
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,050
over at Homeland raised a few good points

394
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,550
I thought I'd follow up on. 

395
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,980
What good points, Mike?

396
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,850
She doesn't understand why she was taken

397
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,780
out of the loop on this Jack Bauer situation. 

398
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,020
You know, I really don't care what Karen Hayes understands. 

399
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
She should be doing her job and not bothering my advisors, 

400
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,050
asking questions that diminish my authority. 

401
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,420
Be that as it may, I did follow up, 

402
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,180
and, uh, now, frankly, 

403
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,850
I'm a little mystified

404
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,250
by some things. 

405
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,950
What things mystify you, Mike?

406
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,580
Well, you told Homeland

407
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,050
that you wanted the military

408
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,250
to pick up Jack Bauer, 

409
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,080
but I just spoke with General Warren, 

410
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,620
and he's unaware of any such directive. 

411
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,220
Because I didn't go through General Warren. 

412
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,280
May I ask who you did go through?

413
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,620
Mike, let's get one thing straight:

414
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,920
I don't answer to you. 

415
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,950
Of course not, sir. 

416
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,280
However, I will tell you this:

417
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,280
I... I have decided to use a covert task force

418
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,780
to bring in Jack Bauer. 

419
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,450
The reason I'm doing that is because Bauer presents... 

420
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,820
special circumstances. 

421
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,520
Special circumstances?

422
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,920
I want this completely off the radar, Mike. 

423
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,380
The Chinese government may still believe that Jack Bauer is dead. 

424
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,180
If they find out that he's alive, 

425
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,180
they're going to blame us. 

426
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,980
They're going to, uh, accuse us

427
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,420
of fabricating the story of his death. 

428
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Um, wouldn't we be keeping the circle smaller

429
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,850
if we let Karen handle this?

430
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,480
Her people already know about Bauer. 

431
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,350
They're working under a secretive mandate. 

432
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,780
You know what, Mike?

433
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,280
I am tired of being

434
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,920
second-guessed. 

435
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,350
I've been dealing with-with-with... 

436
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,780
wall-to-wall crises for the last 18 hours, 

437
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,660
and I think I've done a pretty damn good job of leading the country. 

438
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,840
Of course, Mr.  President. 

439
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,150
You came in here suggesting that I should get some rest. 

440
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,520
That's the one recommendation of yours that I intend to take. 

441
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,410
Thank you, Mike. 

442
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,980
we traced your call

443
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,050
to a public phone at Van Nuys airport. 

444
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,270
If Audrey Raines is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble. 

445
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,770
Miles, this situation is more complicated than you think. 

446
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,520
- You have no idea what you're dealing with.   - But you do. 

447
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,170
-Yes.   - Then why didn't you tell me?

448
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,310
Because I can't. 

449
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,650
You think the rules don't apply to you because you're smarter than the rest of us, 

450
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,020
but I have news for you.  They do, and you're not. 

451
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,000
I won't miss you when you're gone. 

452
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,440
Miles.

453
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
Don't touch me. 

454
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,730
What?

455
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,460
Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer. 

456
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,470
He's a federal fugitive wanted for the murder of a former President, 

457
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,320
which means you're going to jail, O'Brian. 

458
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,510
For a long time. 

459
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,570
Miles.

460
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,190
I don't think you're as big of a jerk as you pretend to be. 

461
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,060
- I need to speak to you.   - Yes, sir. 

462
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,960
What are you doing, Chloe?

463
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,310
You're supposed to be in custody. 

464
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,270
Miles let me out. 

465
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,660
You're a worse liar than I am. 

466
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,920
Shari, don't do that. 

467
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,960
You helped Audrey Raines break surveillance. 

468
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,030
Yes, I did it for a good reason.  I can't get into it right now. 

469
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,680
Well, I don't really think you have a choice. 

470
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,750
Listen to me for a minute. 

471
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,350
Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer.  He knows who did it. 

472
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,240
He may need my help to prove it and I can't help him if I'm in custody. 

473
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,280
Then why don't you just tell Karen?

474
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,740
Because she won't believe me.  Nobody will, not without evidence. 

475
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,560
It's President Logan. 

476
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,760
What are you talking about?

477
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,950
The evidence Jack is trying to get implicates Logan in the assassination of Palmer. 

478
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,990
That's ridiculous, Chloe. 

479
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,270
You know your sexual harassment charges against miles? I know you were lying. 

480
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,110
You're sick and you need help, and if you try to stop me

481
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,700
and it turns out I'm right about Jack, and I am, 

482
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,540
I will recommend you for a psychiatric evaluation. 

483
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,410
And you won't like that, trust me. 

484
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,890
Charles.  You coming to bed soon?

485
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,230
I doubt if I'll get much sleep tonight. 

486
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,740
You should try. 

487
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,780
- You okay?  - I'm fine. 

488
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,930
It's just, uh... it's been

489
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,750
a challenging day. 

490
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,240
Okay. 

491
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,350
Come to bed. 

492
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,990
I will.  Soon. 

493
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,120
yes?

494
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,040
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr.  President, but secretary Heller is on the line. 

495
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,560
He insists on talking to you. 

496
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,450
Tell him I'll call him back tomorrow. 

497
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,690
He says it's urgent, sir. 

498
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,460
Put him through. 

499
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,630
Yes, James. 

500
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,480
Thanks for taking my call, Mr.  President. 

501
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,940
You said it was urgent. 

502
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,180
I need to see you, sir. 

503
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,710
See me about what?

504
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,830
I'd rather speak to you in person. 

505
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,170
Fine, but I won't be back to washington for a couple of days. 

506
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm in L. A. , Sir. 

507
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,600
I need to see you tonight. 

508
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,110
Tonight? What is this about?

509
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,780
I'll be there shortly and we can discuss it then. 

510
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,130
I don't like your tone, James. 

511
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,190
In case you've forgotten, you're addressing the President of the United States. 

512
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,290
I know who I'm addressing. 

513
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,360
And I think you know exactly what this is about. 

514
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,390
When will you be here?

515
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,910
- Five minutes.   - Fine. 

516
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,070
James Heller? What does he want?

517
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,860
He's getting flak from the joint chiefs about my decision to maintain martial law. 

518
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,360
You would think that these people would show some allegiance. 

519
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,710
Can't james handle it himself?

520
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,770
Apparently not. 

521
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,530
- Come to bed when you're done.   - I will. 

522
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,850
Where are you?

523
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,110
we're leaving now. 

524
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,170
- How long will it take you to get there?  - Ten minutes. 

525
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,340
We may not have that much time. 

526
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,780
James Heller is on his way here.  He insisted on seeing me right away. 

527
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,350
Jack got to him. 

528
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,040
What if Bauer's given him the recording?

529
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,700
Heller's not stupid enough to carry it with him, and without it, 

530
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,820
whatever he knows or whatever he thinks he knows won't matter. 

531
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,850
You think Bauer still has it?

532
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,180
I'm sure of it. 

533
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,820
I'll hold Heller off as long as I can, 

534
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,910
- but you phone me the second you have the evidence in hand.   - Right. 

535
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,120
Mrs.  Logan. 

536
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,890
What is Secretary Heller doing here?

537
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,800
I don't know, ma'am. 

538
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,730
But you have an idea. 

539
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,070
My husband says it's about his order to maintain martial law, 

540
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,540
but I think it's something else. 

541
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,800
If you know what it is, will you please tell me?

542
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,660
I can't. 

543
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,840
You can't? Or you won't?

544
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,220
Please don't ask me anything more, Mrs.  Logan. 

545
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,160
Whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us. I promise you. 

546
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,960
Aaron... you can trust me.  You know that.

547
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,000
Not here. 

548
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,460
- Meet me in a couple minutes.   - Where?

549
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,890
Outside the south stable. 

550
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,210
James.

551
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,820
Thank you, gentlemen. 

552
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,740
I hope this was important. 

553
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,580
I know what you did.  I know what you're doing. 

554
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,940
And I'm here to put an end to it. 

555
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,260
You have to be a little more specific. 

556
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,490
You are responsible for the murder of david Palmer. 

557
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,100
That's outrageous. 

558
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,840
I heard a recording... 

559
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,170
a conversation between you and man named christopher Henderson. 

560
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,610
When Palmer found out about your insane plan, Henderson had him killed. 

561
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,530
And you let it happen. 

562
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,780
Where is this recording?

563
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,890
It's in a safe place. 

564
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,760
I would like to hear it. 

565
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,610
Why? You know exactly what you said, and so do I. 

566
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,670
It's burnt into my memory. 

567
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,210
How dare you stand there and judge me?

568
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,660
You have no idea. 

569
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:36,310
Until you sit in my chair, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. 

570
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,230
Your chair is not a throne, Charles. 

571
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,380
- I'm protecting the interests of our country.   - You mean oil. 

572
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,420
Yes.  Yes! This country needs energy

573
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,120
more than you or anybody in this gridlocked government cares to admit. 

574
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,010
We'll see how you judge me when the cost of oil goes up over $100 a barrel

575
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,520
and the people who put me in office can't afford to heat their homes or run their cars. 

576
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,790
And you think that justifies the blood on your hands?

577
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,690
What do you want?

578
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,980
I want you to drop the trumped-up charges against Jack Bauer. 

579
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,210
And leave my daughter alone. 

580
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,710
Anything else?

581
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,190
Announce your resignation by tomorrow morning. 

582
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,950
Blame it on the crushing stress of today's events, or blame it on whatever you want, 

583
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,880
just as long as you go public by the start of the morning news cycle. 

584
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,220
And then what?

585
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,250
The recording will be kept under lock and key, 

586
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,790
and this will remain between us. 

587
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,260
Call in vice President Gardner. 

588
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,870
I want to be here when you hand him your letter of resignation. 

589
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,000
Get in here. 

590
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,400
- I haven't been able to contact Jack or Audrey.   - I haven't talked to them either. 

591
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,680
CTU might have them in custody. 

592
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,220
I need to tap into their current protocols. 

593
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,250
- Where's your workstation?  - This way. 

594
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,320
Homeland changed my access code. 

595
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,520
I can create a workaround. 

596
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,380
If CTU has Jack, it's all my fault. 

597
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,250
I can get us out of here. 

598
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,420
Watch the door. 

599
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,670
he's got restraints in his pocket.  Secure him. 

600
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,990
Wexler, status report. 

601
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,120
Mark, come in. 

602
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,860
Don't move. 

603
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:28,150
Don'T... move. Slowly put the gun on the ground and kick it towards me.

604
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,560
Do it!

605
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,510
Put your hands where I can see them. 

606
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,940
Give me the recording. Slowly. 

607
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,310
Stand up. 

608
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,760
What did you do to my partner?

609
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,740
He's fine. 

610
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,160
Son of a bitch!

611
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,010
Take cover behind the wheel! Now! Move! Move!

612
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,120
What the hell's going on?!

613
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,560
They've come for the recording!

614
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,530
If you and I are gonna get through this alive, we need to work together. 

615
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,980
Give me my gun!

616
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,320
Audrey?

617
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,510
I have her, Jack.  Now don't make me kill her. 

618
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,600
There's been too much killing today already, so just throw out that recording. 

619
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,810
Let her go, Christopher. 

620
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,290
After I have the recording. 

621
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,480
Why are you doing this? Why are you protecting Logan?

622
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,240
I'm protecting something much more important than Charles Logan. 

623
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,490
What?

624
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,300
The integrity of our government. 

625
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,520
Our government has no integrity. 

626
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,040
Not when someone like Charles Logan occupies the presidency. 

627
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,650
Christopher, you can make this right.  You can help me stop him. 

628
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,310
Sorry, Jack.  Now throw me the recording. 

629
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,070
I'll give you the recording if you let Audrey go. 

630
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,280
I wish I could believe that. 

631
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,650
I give you my word. 

632
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,100
I'll tell you what. 

633
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,950
I'll meet you halfway. 

634
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,330
What does that mean?

635
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,950
Audrey?

636
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,740
Damn it, Christopher!

637
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,090
Here she comes, Jack. 

638
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,520
Walk out slow, or I'll kill you. 

639
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,450
Audrey.

640
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,390
Jack

641
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,520
That's far enough, Ms.  Raines. 

642
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,920
What have you done to her?

643
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,690
The left brachial artery. 

644
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,050
She has about three minutes before she bleeds to death. 

645
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,350
Now throw me that recording. 

646
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,850
Jack, don't. 

647
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,790
She's 15 seconds closer to dying, Jack. 

648
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,450
Give me the recording. 

649
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,850
Jack, don't do it. 

650
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,690
She's running out of time. 

651
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,220
Don't do it, Jack. 

652
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,920
Don't.  Don't give it to him. 

653
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,290
Here it is!

654
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,390
Audrey.

655
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,050
Easy, easy, easy. 

656
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,350
Easy.  Stay with me. 

657
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,350
- Stay with me.   - Jack, go get him.  Go get him.  Go. 

658
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,850
Stay with me. 

659
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,020
I'll be right back. 

660
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,520
Here you are. 

661
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,590
I need to move you. 

662
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,020
Come on. 

663
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,720
All it needs is your signature, Mr.  President. 

664
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,050
James, we can find another way to handle this. 

665
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,090
There must be something I can give you, 

666
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,250
something that you want. 

667
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,790
You're giving me exactly what I want. 

668
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,650
You asked to see me, Mr.  President?

669
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,650
Hi, Jim. 

670
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,720
I thought you'd be on a plane back to Washington. 

671
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,350
What are you doing here?

672
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,590
I'll let

673
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,590
President Logan tell you. 

674
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,220
Mr.  President. 

675
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,750
Hal...

676
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,120
Yes. 

677
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,350
I have the recording. 

678
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,790
Really?

679
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,190
I'll call you back

680
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,150
after I've secured a vehicle. 

681
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,250
Thank you. 

682
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,190
Hal,

683
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,790
I'm asking Secretary Heller

684
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,090
to tender his resignation. 

685
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,690
- I wanted you here as a witness.   - What?!

686
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,620
He came here to accuse me of being complicit

687
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,420
in today's terrorist attacks. 

688
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,720
I don't know how he can

689
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,120
make such an accusation without any evidence. 

690
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,950
He orchestrated a conspiracy

691
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,550
to let terrorists acquire

692
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,850
stolen nerve gas. 

693
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,890
That's insane, James. 

694
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,150
He sanctioned the assassination of David Palmer!

695
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,450
And I have the evidence. 

696
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,550
Where? Show it to us. 

697
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,820
Who was on the phone?

698
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,390
Who made that call?

699
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,190
I want your resignation on my desk by the morning. 

700
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,320
If any harm comes to my daughter... 

701
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,320
Gentlemen!

702
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:19,190
Please escort Secretary Heller out of my home. 

703
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


704
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,570
As soon as I get the recording, we're going to have to involve your father. 

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,320
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark. 

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,340
Tell me what this is all about. 

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,170
I will.  I just need a minute. 

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,720
I decide what needs to be done, Mr.  Anderson. 

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,340
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer. 

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,750
President Logan?

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,410
And a man named Christopher Henderson. 

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,150
I know what you did.  I know what you're doing. 

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,810
And I'm going to put an end to it. 

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,590
You asked to see me, Mr.  President?

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,060
Hal, I'm asking Secretary Heller to tender his resignation

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,290
- and I wanted you here as a witness.   - What?!

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,770
He came here to accuse me of being complicit in today's terrorist attacks. 

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,430
- Miles set me up.   - Please come with us, Ms.  O'Brian. 

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,910
We traced your call to a public phone at van nuys airport. 

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,360
If Audrey Raines is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble. 

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,460
You're supposed to be in custody. 

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,840
You helped Audrey Raines break surveillance. 

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,630
You're sick and you need help and if you try to stop me, 

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,680
I will recommend you for psychiatric evaluation. 

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,200
- I haven't been able to contact Jack or Audrey.  - I haven't talked to them either. 

23
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,280
Whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us. I promise you. 

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,780
Not here.  Outside the south stable. 

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,650
- Is Bauer dead?  - Not yet, Mr.  President. 

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,330
- He has the recording.   - Yes, sir. 

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,520
That evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death. 

28
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,680
Son of a bitch. 

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,930
What the hell's going on?!

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
They've come for the recording. 

31
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,990
Audrey!

32
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,750
I have her, Jack!

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,240
What have you done to her?

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,250
The left brachial artery. 

35
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,250
She has about three minutes before she bleeds to death.  Now throw me that recording. 

36
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,670
Jack, don't do it. 

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,080
She's running out of time. 

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,060
- Don't give it up.   - Here it is. 

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,680
Stay with me. 

40
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,600
Stay with me. 

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,710
The follwing takes place between 1:00 A. M.  and 2:00 A. M. 

42
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,100
I need to loosen the tourniquet. 

43
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,270
Oh! Ooh!

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,430
Good.  The bleeding's stopped, which means he didn't sever the brachial artery. 

45
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,850
I need to get you to a doctor. 

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,210
Jack, I can wait.  Do what you have to do. 

47
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,640
- Are you sure? - Yes. 

48
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,880
Keep your arm elevated. 

49
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,910
Chloe O'Brian is not available. 

50
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,820
Chloe's not picking up her phone. 

51
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,230
Is there someone else who can help you track Henderson?

52
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,030
No one who has the same access to the CTU satellite network. 

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,890
Jack, I'm so sorry. This is my fault. 

54
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,550
Audrey, stop it. 

55
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,030
I'll be right back. 

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,160
this is Jack Bauer. 

57
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,310
Jack?

58
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,400
Why are you answering Wexler's phone?

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,140
Wexler's dead.  Henderson and a commando unit attacked us 15 minutes ago. 

60
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,630
They killed all your men and took the recording back. 

61
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,360
Is Audrey all right?

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,870
She's fine. 

63
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,390
Did you cut your deal with Logan?

64
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,780
Logan accepted my terms. 

65
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,000
Then he took a call, and suddenly changed his mind. 

66
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,590
That call must have come from Henderson. 

67
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,510
Jack, we have to get the recording back. 

68
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,240
If there's anything I can do to help, let me know. 

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,670
With all due respect, Mr.  Secretary, 

70
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,170
I asked you for your help, and you betrayed me. 

71
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,940
Jack, I did what I thought was best for this country. 

72
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,270
I made a mistake.  Please forgive me. 

73
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,620
I need to go, sir. 

74
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,590
Come!

75
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,920
- hello?  - Bill, it's Jack. 

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
Jack, we've been waiting to hear from you. 

77
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,390
Did you get the recording to Secretary Heller?

78
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,580
I don't have time to explain.  Henderson's got the recording. 

79
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,750
I need Chloe to help me find him, but I can't reach her. 

80
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,430
Chloe's here with me, Jack. 

81
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,560
She was arrestedby Homeland Security for helping you, but she managed to get away. 

82
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,820
Put her on speaker. 

83
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,270
Jack, where are you?

84
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,070
I'm at Van Nuys airfield.  Chloe, listen to me. 

85
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,970
Henderson left here ten minutes ago with a recording that implicates president Logan. 

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,760
I need you to access CTU's satellite data streams so that we can find him. 

87
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,810
If I log onto their system, they're gonna find me eventually, no matter what I do. 

88
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,380
I don't need you to track him for long.  Do you think you can do it?

89
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,580
I guess I can try to slip in through the subnets. 

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,870
Get back to me when you're in. 

91
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,550
I'll set up a VPN pathway, so that they can't trace our call, 

92
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,500
but it will only work with the phone you're using. 

93
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,810
Okay. 

94
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,010
I got a hold of Chloe.  We need to go. 

95
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,260
- Okay.  Can you get up?  - Yeah. 

96
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,800
Slowly. 

97
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,620
come on. 

98
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,100
If we're going to do extensive satellite tracking, I need more than my laptop. 

99
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,380
I'm gonna have to network onto your computer, 

100
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,430
even though it's kind of pathetic, and I need you to get that screen to work for me.

101
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,270
All right. 

102
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,570
I hope you don't mind me bossing you around, 

103
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,360
but technically, I don't work for you anymore. 

104
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,360
- That's all right, Chloe.   - Good. 

105
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,630
Bauer.

106
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,250
Jack, I'm pulling up satellite footage of the airfield from 15 minutes ago. 

107
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,170
Look for an explosion in the northwest corner. 

108
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,190
Okay, I see it. 

109
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,560
About five minutes after that, a vehicle leaves the airfield. That'll be Henderson. 

110
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,350
He went south on the service drive, and east on menders, 

111
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,800
then I lose him on the grid. 

112
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,690
Use another satellite, traffic cams, whatever you have to, just find him. 

113
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,240
It's gonna take us a few minutes.  We're just setting up, but we're on it. 

114
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,080
Copy that. Get back to me as soon as you got him on a live feed. 

115
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,710
what makes you think that Henderson hasn't already destroyed the recording?

116
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,190
He would have done it immediately, in front of me. 

117
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,420
Given me less of a reason to come after him. 

118
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,900
Why would he keep it?

119
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,770
It's his insurance. 

120
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,640
yes. 

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,720
Is Bauer dead?

122
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,990
No. 

123
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,330
What happened?

124
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,420
All that matters is that I have the recording. 

125
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,360
Have you destroyed it?

126
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,780
No, sir, I have not. 

127
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,410
Why, what's the problem?

128
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,190
Actually, I'm making sure they're won't be any problems. 

129
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,540
I don't understand. 

130
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,570
I may need protection.  That recording gives it to me. 

131
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,920
- Protection?  - Yes, sir. 

132
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,540
Do you mean from me? That's absurd. 

133
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,160
With all due respect, Mr.  President, 

134
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,410
it isn't absurd, as evidenced by walt cummings suicide. 

135
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,560
That was different. 

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,470
You told me yourself that was necessary. 

137
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,570
And I'm assuming that one day, others will tell you the very same thing about me. 

138
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,220
Chris,

139
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,720
you and I have been in this from the beginning. 

140
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Destroying that recording protects both of us. 

141
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,680
I'm sorry, Mr.  President. 

142
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,370
I give you my word it will be kept in a very place safe, 

143
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,550
and will only be made public should I meet with some...

144
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,050
accident. 

145
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,090
Chris, this is completely unnecessary. 

146
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,970
I'm sure it is, sir.  Then again, 

147
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,170
I am a very cautious man. 

148
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,020
Chloe, have you got Henderson yet?

149
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,410
Yes, his car is three quarters of a mile in front of you. 

150
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,460
He had a head start. He should be farther along than that. 

151
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,070
I don't know what to tell you.  It's definitely the car he left the airport in. 

152
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,650
How long until I've got a visual?

153
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,930
The road curves up ahead, Jack. 

154
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,780
You should be able to see him once it straightens out. 

155
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,450
Hold on. 

156
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,620
got him. 

157
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,150
get down. 

158
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,840
Damn!

159
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,420
It's over, Christopher. 

160
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,410
Turn around!

161
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,320
Put the gun down and keep your hands where I can them. 

162
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,780
Do it or I will kill you!

163
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,700
You kill me, Jack, Secretary Heller dies, too. 

164
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,930
What are you talking about?

165
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,500
There's always a contingency plan, Jack.  You know that. 

166
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,190
My men have been tracking Heller from a chopper ever since he left Logan's retreat. 

167
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,830
Now, if I can't contact them every 15 minutes on the dot, 

168
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,710
they have orders to kill Secretary Heller. 

169
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,020
Which means, you got about three minutes to save his life. 

170
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,660
Jack?

171
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,790
Audrey, please get back in the car. 

172
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,460
Is he lying about my father?

173
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,040
Slowly walk towards me. 

174
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,060
Put your hands behind your head. 

175
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,920
Get on your knees. 

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,150
Cuff yourself. 

177
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,970
yeah, Jack. 

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,720
Chloe, patch me through to Secretary Heller's cell phone. 

179
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,690
See if you can get a satellite to lock on his signal. 

180
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,040
I need you to download a visual of his vehicle on my PDA. 

181
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,310
He was leaving Logan's retreat just before 1:00. 

182
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,880
On it.  Open up the parallel channel on the NSA's landsats, 

183
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,530
can radial slices in three mile increments, emanating from the retreat... sir. 

184
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,280
Okay, Jack, I'm pulling up the DOD database. 

185
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,710
Here it is, I'm patching you through. 

186
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,470
Copy that. 

187
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,770
Heller.

188
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,480
Mr.  Secretary, it's Jack.  I need you to confirm for me

189
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,100
if a helicopter's been tracking your vehicle?

190
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,450
What's going on, Jack?

191
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,600
Sir, time is critical.  Is there a helicopter above you or not?

192
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,720
Yeah, there's a chopper above me.  Who are they?

193
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,740
Henderson's men. He claims he's given them orders to kill you if I don't let him go. 

194
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,240
Is he bluffing?

195
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,010
He doesn't do that, sir. 

196
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,980
Jack, I've got Heller's car.  I'm patching it through to your pda. 

197
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,680
Copy that. 

198
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,100
Jack...

199
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,220
they have a laser sight trained on me. 

200
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,590
Get up. 

201
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,760
You give me the recording, I let you go: That's the deal. 

202
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,920
No. 

203
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,380
Come on, Jack, you're wasting time. 

204
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,710
We both know you're not going to let Heller die. 

205
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,730
I can hear him, Jack; don't let him do this. 

206
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,060
I'm going to walk out of here, Jack, 

207
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,800
and you're not gonna stop me, so uncuff me. 

208
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,960
Jack, don't let him go. 

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
I don't have a choice, sir. 

210
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,810
Yes, you do. 

211
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,730
If I had listened to you in the first place, none of this would be happening. 

212
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,050
This is my responsibility, 

213
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,250
I will not allow Logan and Henderson to use me as a pawn. 

214
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,310
Sir?

215
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,850
Do not let them get away with this. 

216
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,210
Make sure that the recording gets to the right people. 

217
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,070
Tell Audrey I love her. 

218
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,630
Mr.  Secretary, what are you doing?!

219
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,640
Chloe, are you still on the line?!

220
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,590
Can you confirm that Heller just drove his car into the lake?

221
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,290
Yes. 

222
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,940
Damn you!

223
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,150
Oh, my god, no. 

224
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,450
How could you do this?

225
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,950
This isn't about what you think is best for the country. 

226
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,950
This is about your greed for power. 

227
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,790
Today, you have been responsible

228
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,630
for killing an ex-president, David Palmer, 

229
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,100
and the secretary of defense, two real patriots. 

230
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,480
Damn you!

231
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,140
What happened to you?

232
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,240
Give me the recording. 

233
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,180
I don't have it. 

234
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,180
Where is it?!

235
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,390
I'm not going to tell you, Jack. 

236
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,920
And you know that... no matter what you do to me. 

237
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,350
Do it. 

238
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,360
Kill him, Jack.  Do it!

239
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,090
Yeah. 

240
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,870
- Graham?  - Yes. 

241
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,640
You need to cancel the action against Henderson immediately. 

242
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,440
Why?

243
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,780
He has the recording, but he's made arrangements

244
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,480
to have it released if anything happens to him. 

245
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,710
You should have exercised more control over him. 

246
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,190
There's a limit to how much I can do. 

247
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,220
- Apparently.   - Don't. 

248
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,200
Don't you use that tone with me.  We've both made mistakes today. 

249
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,760
You're right, Mr.  President, my apologies, 

250
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,190
but the fact is, I think we have a bigger problem than Henderson. 

251
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,510
What? What are you talking about?

252
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,620
At least he can be trusted to act rationally, in his own interest. 

253
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,400
Unfortunately, the same is not true of your wife. 

254
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,870
My wife. 

255
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,050
Apparently, there's a secret service agent named Aaron Pierce

256
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,800
who knows a little more than he should.  He intends to share that with martha. 

257
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,520
I'm well aware of that, and I've taken steps to deal with agent pierce. 

258
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,710
But the real problem is Mrs.  Logan. 

259
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,330
She continues to talk, to ask questions, talk about her suspicions. 

260
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,710
People don't take her seriously.  They think she's unstable. 

261
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,080
There are too many loose ends lying around. 

262
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,080
We cannot afford to have her pull on one and unravel everything. 

263
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,460
You think I don't realize that?

264
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,390
I think

265
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,500
you're in a very difficult position and that you have been hoping

266
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,170
the situation with martha would resolve itself, but it hasn't. You must silence her. 

267
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,560
I know. 

268
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,680
But I'll handle this myself. 

269
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,450
Mrs.  Logan, 

270
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,390
Agent Pierce was transferred. 

271
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,050
That's what you keep saying, 

272
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,520
but it doesn't make any sense, not at 1:00 in the morning. 

273
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,620
We work around the clock, ma'am. 

274
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,310
It's quite common for agents to get pulled off details at odd hours. 

275
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,840
Right when they're supposed to have a meeting with the first lady of the united states?

276
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,640
- I don't know anything about a meeting.   - Well, I do!

277
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,670
I found Aaron's phone laying on the ground, right where we were supposed to meet. 

278
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,760
Now, I want you to find agent Pierce, and I want you to get him back here, right now!

279
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,870
There's a glitch in the scheduling software, I can not pull that record up right now. 

280
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,210
And are these glitches quite common, as well?

281
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,720
Actually, no, but... Mrs.  Logan. 

282
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,510
I'm Agent Adams.  I think I can explain everything. 

283
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,170
Well?

284
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,620
This is a sensitive issue, ma'am.  President Logan would like you to come with me. 

285
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,120
What is this "sensitive" information?

286
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,630
Is it about Agent Pierce?

287
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,600
I'm sorry... you need to talk to the president about that. 

288
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,450
I'm asking you. 

289
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,380
Do you know where Aaron Pierce is?

290
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,160
No, ma'am, I don't. 

291
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,830
Is this where my husband is?

292
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,000
I want to talk to him. 

293
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,230
Charles?

294
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,500
Hello?

295
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,190
Yeah. 

296
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,250
Henderson wasn't lying.  He doesn't have the recording on him. 

297
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,290
Could it be in his car?

298
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,540
No, he wouldn't have left it behind.  There must have been some kind of a hand-off. 

299
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,240
What do you mean?

300
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,100
Well, that would explain why he wasn't any farther ahead of me. 

301
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,870
when I left Van Nuys Airfield. 

302
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,840
He must have stopped and given it to someone. 

303
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,540
Okay, I'll back trace the route with the satellite, 

304
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,170
see if I can spot anything. 

305
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,740
Yeah. 

306
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,570
Jack, we're getting that recording and exposing Logan. 

307
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,040
I don't care how far I have to go

308
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,200
or what I have to do, 

309
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,540
Do you understand, Jack?

310
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,370
Yes. 

311
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,040
Go ahead. 

312
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,800
Jack, you were right, I found the hand-off. 

313
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,670
Henderson stopped and rendezvoused with another car. 

314
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,200
I'm sorry I didn't see it before. 

315
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,570
Can you track the other car?

316
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
We're tracking it now, Jack. 

317
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,400
It headed back to Van Nuys. 

318
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,640
Looks like the civilian side of the airfield. 

319
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,970
Pulled onto the tarmac. 

320
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,170
Whoever was in it got out and got directly onto the plane. 

321
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,670
Isn't air traffic still grounded?

322
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,770
Yeah, this is not a commercial flight. 

323
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,600
I'll find out what I can about it. 

324
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,840
Jack, the plane is servicing. 

325
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,970
It's about to take off. 

326
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,070
Has Curtis been relieved of his duty, 

327
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,540
or is he still attached to CTU?

328
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,670
He's at CTU, taking orders from Homeland Security, 

329
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,170
but I think we can trust him, Jack. 

330
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,540
Where is he?

331
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,970
According to the deployment grid, 

332
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,000
he's 25 miles northwest of you, with a tac team. 

333
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,400
Bill, I want you to call him. 

334
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,240
Get him to this location as soon as possible. 

335
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,000
I want him to transfer Henderson and Audrey back to CTU. 

336
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,340
Are you sure that's a good idea?

337
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
Logan's in control at CTU. 

338
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,100
Curtis will be able to protect them. 

339
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,700
Right now, it's our best chance to secure Henderson

340
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,470
and get Audrey the medical attention she needs. 

341
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,700
Calling Curtis now, Jack. 

342
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,270
Thanks. 

343
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,100
What's happening?

344
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,670
The person Henderson gave the recording to

345
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,470
just boarded a plane at Van Nuys Airfield. 

346
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,040
Why aren't you going now?

347
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,970
I'll go as soon as Curtis gets here... he's not far. 

348
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,970
Jack, I'll be fine until then. 

349
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,070
I'm not leaving you here alone. 

350
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,500
Jack, if you don't get that recording, 

351
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,000
my father will have died for nothing. 

352
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,700
Jack...

353
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,800
for me. 

354
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,870
Henderson is secure. 

355
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,440
When he regains consciousness, 

356
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,940
I don't want you going anywhere near him. 

357
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,240
You don't even talk to him. 

358
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,670
- You understand me?  - I understand. 

359
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,500
We have to assume his people are still looking for him. 

360
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,000
They're gonna be monitoring all non-VPN cell traffic, 

361
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,140
which means, you can't make or receive any calls

362
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,700
unless they come from me. 

363
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,340
Here's Wexler's cell. 

364
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,740
I've got the number. 

365
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,570
All right. 

366
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,900
Audrey, I don't feel right about this. 

367
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,070
I'm going to be all right. 

368
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,200
I'm so sorry. 

369
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,740
Jack, you have to go now. 

370
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,470
Jack?

371
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,370
Make sure you get

372
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,340
that recording. 

373
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,340
I will. 

374
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,230
Let me know as soon as you're done. 

375
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,700
Vladimir Bierko has regained consciousness. 

376
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,600
But we're still waiting for the medical assessment to be finished

377
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,500
Let me know when they give us the go ahead. 

378
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,870
Final protocol shifts. 

379
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,200
You can tell Washington the transfer of authority

380
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,000
from CTU to Homeland is officially complete. 

381
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,630
Okay. 

382
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,530
Two hours ahead of schedule, Karen. 

383
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,130
That is remarkable. 

384
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,230
I'm sorry, 

385
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,270
my head is somewhere else. 

386
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,270
Where?

387
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,430
We gave the President

388
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,330
Bauer's location over an hour ago. 

389
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
We should have heard something by now. 

390
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,500
The military authority is handling Bauer. 

391
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,930
Yes, I know, but this doesn't make any sense. 

392
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,830
The President insisted we redirect our focus

393
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,100
from Henderson to Bauer. 

394
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,830
We find Bauer, and then he hands the mission

395
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,830
over to the military. 

396
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,870
Karen, we're out of that loop. 

397
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,000
Karen Hayes.

398
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,230
Ma'am, we have a problem. 

399
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,100
Chloe O'Brian got out of holding, 

400
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,600
and as far as I can tell, she's not in the building. 

401
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,300
Not in the building? How's that possible?

402
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,830
I'm still gathering the details. 

403
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,770
But I reviewed the surveillance tape, and it looks like

404
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,270
Shari had a conversation with her, and Shari let her go. 

405
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,300
Shari didn't try to stop her? Why?

406
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,730
before we can begin the interrogation. I don't know. She won't tell me.

407
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,170
I had security take her into custody. 

408
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,970
Good.  Bring her up here right now. 

409
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,770
We need to focus on how we find Chloe now. 

410
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,170
My guess is she'll try to contact Bauer.

411
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,500
I agree, but how?

412
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,370
She was using CTU resources before to help Bauer. 

413
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,030
Maybe she'll try that again.  Which means

414
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,770
she could try to access our system remotely. 

415
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,270
All she needs is a laptop. 

416
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,530
That's right. 

417
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,930
She'll disguise her traffic. 

418
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,300
Can you get through that?

419
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,530
I can trace her physical location by looking at the binaries. 

420
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,370
Do it. 

421
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,570
Wait outside. 

422
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,430
Why did you let Chloe escape?

423
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,100
She intimidated me. 

424
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,570
She intimidated you?

425
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,630
Sit down. 

426
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,270
You are in a great deal trouble, Miss Rothenberg. 

427
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,530
You had better start talking

428
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,070
to me now. 

429
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,730
She said she'd recommend me for psychiatric evaluation. 

430
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,030
I'd lose my job. 

431
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,270
I'm sorry, Miss Hayes. 

432
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,430
There's something wrong with me, 

433
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,030
I know that.  Shari...

434
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
- And I should probably see someone...  - Shari!

435
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,570
Did Chloe tell you why she was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

436
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,270
She thinks Jack is innocent. 

437
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,970
Based on what?

438
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,230
Based on some absurd idea

439
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,830
that President Logan framed Bauer. 

440
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,900
She even said something about President Logan being involved

441
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,500
in the assassination of David Palmer. 

442
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,370
I mean, can you believe her?

443
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,030
And people think I'm crazy. 

444
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,170
Damn it, open this door!

445
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,030
I don't know what you think you're doing, 

446
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,270
but you'd better think again!

447
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,270
Unlock it. 

448
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,270
Open it!

449
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,930
Charles.

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,370
I want that man arrested!

451
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,470
And I want know where Aaron Pierce is. 

452
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,670
Shh. 

453
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,670
Martha, calm down. 

454
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,630
All right? Aaron's fine. 

455
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,700
I just transferred him back to Washington, that's all. 

456
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,830
In the middle of the night?

457
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,030
Doesn't make any sense. 

458
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,670
And why am I locked in this room?

459
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,030
'Cause we need to talk. 

460
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,030
About what?

461
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,730
Martha, I've been wanting to tell you this, 

462
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,000
but I told myself

463
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,600
that you were too fragile to handle it. 

464
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,870
But that's not the truth. 

465
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,630
The truth is, I've kept this from you

466
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,170
because it's horrible and because it's ugly. 

467
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,630
What are you talking about?

468
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,170
What happened to David Palmer wasn't supposed to happen. 

469
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,530
He put himself in harm's way, and he got involved

470
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,930
with something that he shouldn't have. 

471
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,770
What are you saying?

472
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,300
That I never authorized his death. 

473
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,830
You... mean...

474
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,000
you know who killed David?

475
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,400
Yes. 

476
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,430
How do you know that?

477
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,200
He works for me. 

478
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,430
What?

479
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,930
- Martha, it's very complicated.   - What?!

480
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,130
There's an explanation. 

481
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,530
What?! An explanation?! Oh, my God!

482
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,670
- Stop!  - Go to hell!

483
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,270
Stop! You don't understand!

484
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,730
Oh, my God!

485
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,400
You're involved in David's murder. 

486
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,500
Martha...

487
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,830
Oh, my God, oh, my God. 

488
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Why are you telling me this?

489
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,900
Why are you telling me this?

490
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,130
Because you're on your way

491
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,700
to finding out the truth on your own. 

492
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,900
And because you need to stop. 

493
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,630
- Stop what?  - You have to stop

494
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,900
asking questions, you have to stop

495
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,570
talking about this to everyone. 

496
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,600
Never again. 

497
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,230
Martha, do you realize

498
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,870
how traumatic this would be for the country

499
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,600
if people were to find out?

500
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,900
Oh, yes, we're worried about the country. 

501
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,170
Damn it, Martha!

502
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,700
That's the most important part of this!

503
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,700
This scandal would destroy

504
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,970
the American people's faith in their government. 

505
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,400
It would destroy our credibility

506
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,270
all over the world. 

507
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,300
You lied to me. 

508
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,630
Everything. 

509
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,130
This whole day has been one giant lie. 

510
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,030
What you've done makes me sick!

511
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,430
Martha, enough!

512
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,970
I know

513
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,300
that what I did, what I allowed to happen, was a mistake. 

514
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,100
It was a terrible mistake. 

515
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,000
But it's done. 

516
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,170
Right now, I need you to swear to me

517
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,030
that you will do as I ask...

518
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,200
for the country, Martha. 

519
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,430
I've forgiven you many things, Charles, 

520
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,370
but not this. 

521
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,000
You've broken my heart. 

522
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,830
I'm looking at you...

523
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,070
I hate you. 

524
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,370
But I will keep my mouth shut. 

525
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,470
Because the people of this country

526
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,530
don't deserve to suffer. 

527
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,200
You do, Charles. 

528
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,450
Are you sure we're going to get through this the way we planned?

529
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,820
What does that mean?

530
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,850
There's too many loose ends. 

531
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,450
What operation doesn't have loose ends?

532
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,350
Of course we're not going to get through this

533
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,020
the way we planned.  No one ever does. 

534
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
I have never made a deal in my life that didn't feel like

535
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,820
it was going to fall apart in the 11th hour. 

536
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,250
Now, if you don't have the stomach

537
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,150
to deal with a few bumps, 

538
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,380
then this is not the room where you belong. 

539
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,720
And that goes for all of you. 

540
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,250
You're starting to have doubts. 

541
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,420
I can smell it, 

542
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,150
and I don't like it. 

543
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,150
You need to remember the strength we had

544
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,520
18 months ago when we started this thing. 

545
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,350
We okay, Ron?

546
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,280
Yeah. 

547
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
Think about your kids. 

548
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
That's what I do when I need to get focused.

549
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,920
Yeah?

550
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,680
The situation with Martha is taken care of. 

551
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,620
I spoke to her. 

552
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,620
And?

553
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,420
And I made it very clear

554
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,180
that if she continues with this behavior, 

555
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,080
I will send her back to the hospital in Vermont. 

556
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,380
Well, you were going to have her committed earlier today. 

557
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,650
But you changed your mind?

558
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,250
It's because she found out the truth. 

559
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,280
And I decided I should keep her close. 

560
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,550
What if she finds out the truth again?

561
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,750
She won't. 

562
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,350
And if she does, I will handle it, 

563
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,480
just like I have all day. 

564
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,880
Okay. 

565
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,350
Fair enough. 

566
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,550
You have done a remarkable job today, Mr.  President.

567
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,950
I will admit that. 

568
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,820
Thank you. 

569
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,620
It's about time I heard some words of appreciation. 

570
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,620
Oh, listen to me, we were just talking about

571
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,880
how you've had to be on the front line through this, 

572
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,920
how you've had to get your hands dirty, 

573
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,680
while we could just sit back and watch from a safe distance. 

574
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,050
You've earned our trust. 

575
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,550
And I am sure...

576
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,050
that you will do whatever it takes to keep your wife in line. 

577
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,350
Audrey.

578
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,720
Where's Jack?

579
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,750
Audrey.

580
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,920
I'm sorry about your father. 

581
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,780
I never intended

582
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,650
your father to get in the middle of this. 

583
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,750
I've known Secretary Heller a very long time. 

584
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,980
He's an honorable man. 

585
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,350
What time is it?

586
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,020
It's ten to 12 minutes since...

587
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,020
If those windows didn't collapse

588
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,280
when that car hit the water, 

589
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,120
it could have created an air pocket or something. 

590
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,620
20, 30 minutes in a submerged car, even at 100 feet, 

591
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,920
- if there was an air pocket.   - Stop it. 

592
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,720
Your father could be alive. 

593
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,280
Secretary...

594
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,150
Secretary Heller could be alive inside that car. 

595
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,000
If he's alive, you got to do something about it. 

596
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,900
I mean, if there's a possibility that he's living, 

597
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,600
you got to call military authority or the emergency services or something. 

598
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,100
I mean, for god's sake, he's your father. 

599
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,800
Stop it! Stop it!

600
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Stop! Stop! Stop!

601
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,500
Stop talking!

602
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,500
What, do you think I'm stupid?

603
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,700
You want me to make that phone call so that your people can find me. 

604
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,500
Audrey, my people are going to find us anyway. 

605
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,300
And Jack's not going to stop all this. 

606
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm trying to help your father. 

607
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,100
Your father's drowning in a car, 

608
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,400
and you're not doing anything about it. 

609
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
You're gonna live with that the rest of your life. 

610
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,100
Shut up. 

611
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,300
He is dying, 

612
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,200
and you are doing nothing, Audrey. 

613
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,500
You are doing nothing. 

614
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,400
I swear to god, 

615
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,600
not another word. 

616
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,100
Jack.

617
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,800
I've got a visual on the plane. 

618
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,300
It must be some kind of diplomatic flight. 

619
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,400
There's a lot of security on the ground. 

620
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,500
We have a problem. 

621
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,200
What?

622
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,100
I've been tracking the helicopter that Henderson's men used to shadow Secretary Heller. 

623
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,600
And?

624
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,500
It changed course, 

625
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,500
it's heading towards where Audrey's holding Henderson. 

626
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,400
How could they find them?

627
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,900
I don't know...

628
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,800
maybe they're using satellite imagery, too. 

629
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,700
The point is, they're going to be there any second. 

630
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,600
Where's curtis?

631
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,800
Based on the speed of the chopper, 

632
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,700
he might not make it there before Henderson's men, Jack. 

633
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,500
Upload your visual to my PDA. 

634
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,600
Advise Curtis of the situation, 

635
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,500
I'll get back to you. 

636
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,800
Jack?

637
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,000
Audrey, listen to me. 

638
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,800
Henderson's men have zeroed in on your location, 

639
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,300
they're heading back towards you. 

640
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,000
You've got to get out of there now. 

641
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
And just leave him?

642
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,000
We don't have a choice. 

643
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,300
Yes, we do, Jack. 

644
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,900
I have the gun and I can kill him. 

645
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,300
Audrey, we need him alive. 

646
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,500
Curtis's team is almost there, 

647
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,700
they'll track him down and they will secure him. 

648
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,600
You've got to get out of there. 

649
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,700
Jack, he's responsible for the death of my father's death. 

650
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,800
I can't just leave him here!

651
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,300
Audrey, please, 

652
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,700
listen to what I'm telling you. 

653
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
You've got to start moving now. 

654
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,000
Audrey!

655
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Stipes, get over and get these handcuffs off me. 

656
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Heller's daughter's somewhere in this building...

657
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,300
kill her. 

658
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,900
Then get back here, 

659
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
we'll deal with Bauer. 

660
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,000
Audrey, it's me. 

661
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,300
Stay down. 

662
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,400
secure him for transport back to CTU. 

663
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,900
- You okay?  - Yeah. 

664
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,900
Hostiles are down and we have Henderson in custody. 

665
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,400
yeah?

666
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,200
It's me. 

667
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,900
What's happening?

668
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,700
Curtis's team killed Henderson's men

669
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,300
and they're taking Henderson into custody. 

670
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,800
Jack, I tried to shoot him, 

671
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,700
but I couldn'T. 

672
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,200
The only thing that matters is that you're safe. 

673
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,100
I'm fine. 

674
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,300
You sure?

675
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,800
Yeah. 

676
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,800
Okay, good. 

677
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Let me speak to Curtis. 

678
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,500
Curtis?

679
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,200
It's Jack. 

680
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,000
Go ahead. 

681
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,400
Yeah, Jack?

682
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,000
Curtis, I want you to transport Audrey back to CTU as quickly as possible. 

683
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
And get her over to medical. 

684
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,800
And I want you to tell Karen Hayes

685
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
that no one is have access to Christopher Henderson. 

686
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
She'll be taken care of. 

687
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,700
But as far as Henderson goes, 

688
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,700
CTU is more interested in apprehending you than taking your advice. 

689
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Just do what you can. 

690
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,200
I'll get back to you. 

691
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,200
Jack, is Audrey all right?

692
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,100
Yeah, she's gonna be fine. 

693
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,900
Curtis is in control of the situation. 

694
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,600
Chloe, what have you got on the plane?

695
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
The details just came in. 

696
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,300
You were right, it is a chartered diplomatic flight, 

697
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,400
security-level eight, 

698
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,300
scheduled to leave at 2:00 A. M.  Or sooner. 

699
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,600
Okay, we need to find out who's onboard so we can try

700
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,800
and figure out who Henderson passed off the recording to. 

701
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,400
I'll try...

702
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,000
it's not going to be easy getting past the state department's firewall. 

703
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,000
I understand. 

704
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,000
Bill, see if you could slow down the departure of this flight

705
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,500
so I can figure out a way to get on it. 

706
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,500
All right, Jack. 

707
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,300
There's a maintenance gate on the northwest side of the airfield. 

708
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,200
You should be able to get close to the plane there. 

709
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,300
I know, I'm there. 

710
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,900
Just get back to me as soon as you've got the passenger list. 

711
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,100
yeah?

712
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,100
Jack, we've tried everything we can

713
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,800
there's no way to delay the plane. 

714
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,600
It's taking off in less than ten minutes. 

715
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,300
Okay. 

716
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,900
Has Chloe got the passenger list yet?

717
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,500
I still can't get past the firewall. 

718
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,100
Chloe, I need that list. 

719
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
Jack, I'm trying. 

720
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,600
There you are. 

721
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,000
- yeah?  - I got O'Brian. 

722
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,400
Did you find her on our system?

723
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,800
Yes, she's using one of our nodes to try to log-in to the state department network. 

724
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,700
Do we know why?

725
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,400
No, but she was using a work around I'd never seen before. 

726
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,500
So I machine-coded a matrix to get through...

727
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
miles, we just need to find her. 

728
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,700
Where she is?

729
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I'm running a physical trace. 

730
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
It's a private house. 

731
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,200
Cross-referencing with property records. 

732
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,500
Karen...

733
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,100
she's working out of bill buchanan's house. 

734
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,400
Are you sure?

735
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,000
Positive. 

736
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,800
We have a tac team not far away. 

737
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,200
I'll dispatch them now. 

738
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,300
What's their eta?

739
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,500
I'm showing less then seven minutes. 

740
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,700
Good, keep me posted. 

741
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,300
Novick.

742
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,900
Mike, it's karen hayes. 

743
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,900
Karen.

744
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,600
How are things going over there?

745
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,300
It's a rough transition from CTU to homeland, 

746
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,300
but we're getting through it. 

747
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,800
That's good to hear. What do you need?

748
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,800
I need some clarification. 

749
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,400
We were sent over here on a directive from the white house, 

750
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,200
but we've been dealing exclusively with vice president Gardner

751
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
until about two hours ago. 

752
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,400
What happened two hours ago?

753
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,100
The president called me himself

754
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,200
and ordered me to arrest Jack Bauer on evidence he was unwilling to share with me. 

755
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,700
Yes. 

756
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,900
I know about that. 

757
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,100
Have you seen the evidence?

758
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,300
No, actually, I... I haven't. 

759
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,900
Mike...

760
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,600
who has seen it?

761
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,200
I don't have a good answer for that. 

762
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,700
Are you telling me you're not in the loop?

763
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,300
Actually...

764
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,100
I don't even think there is a loop. 

765
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,500
The president is keeping his own counsel at the moment. 

766
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
That's a first. 

767
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,000
Yes.  It is. 

768
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,200
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

769
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,700
Uh, nothing that I can say with any authority. 

770
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
All I know is that...

771
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,800
it's been a strange night. 

772
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,300
I see. 

773
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,000
I wish I could be more helpful. 

774
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,400
No, mike, actually, 

775
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,000
you've been very helpful. 

776
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,700
Thank you. 

777
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,100
hello?

778
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,800
This is karen hayes. 

779
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,700
You have less than seven minutes to get Chloe out of there. 

780
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,300
Karen, I don't know what you're talking about, 

781
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,100
Chloe's not here. 

782
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,000
Bill, stop. 

783
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,400
Miles traced Chloe through a remote node she's accessing. 

784
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
And if you don't believe me, 

785
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,600
tell her he used a machine-coded matrix to find her. 

786
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,500
Karen, why are you warning us?

787
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,500
Because I may have made a mistake earlier. 

788
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,700
A lot of things have not made sense today, 

789
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,900
until Shari told me what Chloe said. 

790
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,100
About president logan being... involved. 

791
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,200
I've got to go. 

792
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,800
Just get out of there, now. 

793
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,200
Chloe, we have to go. 

794
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,200
I can't leave yet. 

795
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Jack needs the passenger list. 

796
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,100
Chloe, if they find you here, 

797
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,800
you'll be arrested. 

798
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
You have to go now!

799
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,000
Not yet. 

800
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,200
It's the last one!

801
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,000
Let's get this thing out of here. 

802
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


803
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,360
What happened to David Palmer wasn't supposed to happen.

2
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,600
He put himself in harm's way, and he got involved

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,930
in something that he shouldn't have.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You know who killed David?

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,000
He works for me.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,900
You lied to me.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,960
This entire day has been one giant lie!

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,160
What you've done makes me sick!

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,630
Martha, enough!

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,900
I need you to swear to me that you will do

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,460
as I ask for the country.

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,230
I hate you.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,130
The situation with Martha is taken care of.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,830
There are too many loose ends lying around.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,100
We cannot afford to have her

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,400
pull on one and unravel everything.

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,630
She won't.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,960
I have the recording.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,160
Have you destroyed it?

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,430
No, sir, I have not.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,630
You and I have been in this from the beginning.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,600
Destroying that recording protects both of us.

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,500
I've got O'Brian.

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,000
Where is she?

25
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,360
She's walking out of Bill Buchanan's house.

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,160
Did Chloe tell you why she was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

27
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,830
'Cause she thinks Jack is innocent,

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,800
that President Logan framed Bauer.

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,500
This is Karen Hayes... Miles traced Chloe to your house.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
You have less than seven minutes to get Chloe out of there.

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,530
Karen, why are you warning us?

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,630
Because I may have made a mistake earlier.

33
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,960
Chloe, if they find you here, you'll be arrested.

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,200
You have to go now.

35
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,030
Not yet.

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,330
It's over, Christopher! Turn around!

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,060
Give me the recording.

38
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,660
- I don't have it.  - Where is it?!

39
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,130
Henderson wasn't lying.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,360
He doesn't have the recording on him.

41
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,730
There must've been some kind of a hand-off.

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,500
Henderson stopped and rendezvoused with another car.

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,630
Can you track the other car?

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,900
We're tracking it now, Jack.

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,060
It headed back to Van Nuys...

46
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,400
looks like the civilian side of the airfield...

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,630
pulled onto the tarmac. Whoever it was got out 

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,630
and got directly onto the plane.

49
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,560
It is a chartered diplomatic flight.

50
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,000
Jack, we've tried everything we can.

51
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,500
There's no way to delay it.

52
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,660
Okay, call me when you've got 'em. Yeah.

53
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,060
Bill, are you out? The field team's almost there.

54
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,730
Chloe's packing the comm gear she needs

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
to stay in touch with Jack.

56
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,430
- Where is Jack?  - Van Nuys Airport.

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,160
He stowed away on a diplomatic flight that just took off.

58
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,200
What? Why?

59
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,730
He's trying to find a recording that implicates President Logan.

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,500
And someone on that flight has it?

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
Yes, and we don't know who.

62
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,860
That's what Chloe's been trying to find out.

63
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,760
- Hang on. Yeah?  - Field team's a block away from Buchanan's.

64
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll set up here for the remote debrief of O'Brian.

65
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,230
No. Put it in the Situation Room.

66
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,830
- Oh, I thought you wanted...  - I want it in the Situation Room. Go.

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,260
Bill, the field team's

68
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,500
gonna be there any second.

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,600
- Get Chloe out of there now.  - How close are they?

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,530
One block.

71
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,260
All right, I'm gonna have to run interference.

72
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,830
It's more important that she gets away.

73
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,960
Good. I'll bring you in.

74
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,700
You'll be treated as a suspect.

75
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,730
We never talked.

76
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,460
Understood. They're here.

77
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,400
- Out the back.  - Bill, wait.

78
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,830
Have Chloe call me on a dry channel.

79
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,900
Either one-five or two-seven.

80
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,160
Dry channel, one-five or two-seven. Got it.

81
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,960
There's a gate in back.

82
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,400
Follow the path between the houses to the alley, 

83
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,160
turn right and go to Ventura Boulevard.

84
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,630
What about the curfew?

85
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,130
There's a hotel on the Boulevard, the Miramont.

86
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,130
You should be able to make it there without being spotted.

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,630
- What about you?  - I'm gonna make sure you're not followed.

88
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,460
I'll be at CTU, probably in Holding.

89
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,930
- Why in Holding?  - Karen's gonna place me under arrest.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,900
If you need anything, contact her.

91
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,860
- Why is she...  - Chloe, please, just go.

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,700
Who is it?

93
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,360
Homeland Security.

94
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,360
Mr. Buchanan, 

95
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,600
we need you to open the door.

96
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,600
We're under order from Karen Hayes.

97
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,460
I'll be right there.

98
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,200
What, uh, what's going on?

99
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,000
Please step aside, sir. We need to search the house.

100
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,330
No, I'm not stepping aside. Do you have a warrant?

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,500
Where's Chloe O'Brian?

102
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,460
- I have no idea.  - Sir,

103
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,460
don't make us use force... we know she's been here.

104
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,400
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.

105
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,630
Where is she?

106
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,900
I don't know where Chloe O'Brian is.

107
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,030
She's not here.

108
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,860
Sir? This is a recent file from Comm.

109
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,560
Only O'Brian could access it.

110
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,560
Talk to us, sir.

111
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm not talking to you.

112
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,060
I'll talk to Karen Hayes.

113
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,930
Mr. Papazian, 

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,700
we are on site... it appears Chloe O'Brian was here, 

115
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,030
but she is gone.

116
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,330
Is Bill Buchanan there?

117
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,430
- Yes, sir.  - We lost O'Brian.

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,530
- Damn it!  - Put him on the phone, please.

119
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,900
Hello?

120
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,300
Don't play games with me, Bill.

121
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,660
Just give me O'Brian's location, 

122
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,100
or I will make it very bad for you.

123
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,470
From what I understand, Miles, 

124
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,260
she got out of CTU right under your nose.

125
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,560
You're the one who ought to be concerned, not me.

126
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,800
Bill, this is Karen Hayes. Tell us what you know now.

127
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,730
Stop wasting our time.

128
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,630
I'm not saying any more.

129
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,530
This is Ed.

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,860
Ed, bring Buchanan in.

131
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,860
Set up a grid search for Chloe.

132
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,330
She's probably got a car, 

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,600
which means she's about 15 miles out.

134
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,060
Copy that.

135
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,400
But the agents on site

136
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,400
are trained for interrogation.

137
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,930
Why are you bringing him in?

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,660
Because I want to run this, Miles.

139
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,930
- But now it's us who are wasting time here.  - Don't worry.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,160
I will make him talk.

141
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,700
I'll be in my office.

142
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,330
- Yeah?  - I'm set up at the Miramont Hotel.

143
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,260
Make sure no one looks for me here.

144
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,660
I'll take care of that.

145
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,330
Tell me what else you need.

146
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,730
Jack's on diplomatic flight 520. Pull up the manifest.

147
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,860
Got it. Flight 520 to Frankfurt.

148
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,760
Okay, put everything you've got from that flight under

149
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,360
the shared volume so I can get to it.

150
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,930
Crew, passengers, cargo, everything.

151
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,330
Done.

152
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,330
Okay, I see it.

153
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,700
Thanks.

154
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,200
Yeah.

155
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,000
- Jack, are you okay?  - I'm fine. Did you get what I need?

156
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,630
I've got the passenger list...

157
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,030
it's gonna take some time to cross it against Henderson.

158
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,200
What about the air marshal?

159
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,700
That I'll have in a couple of minutes.

160
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,230
Okay, good. What's happening at CTU?

161
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,460
They're still under orders from the president to stop you.

162
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,800
- But Karen Hayes is backing us.  - Openly?

163
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,430
No, but she's letting me help you.

164
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,530
If there's proof against Logan, she wants it found.

165
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,030
The proof is on this plane.

166
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,860
Check the flight manifest, 

167
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,260
figure out which passenger has a connection to Henderson.

168
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,230
- And get back to me with the air marshal's seat number.  - I will.

169
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,730
I don't think so.

170
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Oh, hey. I was just asking.

171
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,000
You don't have to go all feminist on me.

172
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,630
Did you see that?

173
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,030
21st-century woman.

174
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,060
We better get used to it.

175
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,930
Yeah.

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,430
Jack, I found the air marshal... his name is George Avila.

177
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,860
- He's sitting in 7A.  - Anyone sitting next to him?

178
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,300
- No.  - Okay, good.

179
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,700
Get back to me when you've got the connection to Henderson.

180
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Got it.

181
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,030
Excuse me.

182
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,160
Is that seat taken?

183
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
No.

184
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,330
Thanks.

185
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,500
The stewardess said I could change seats...

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,430
I was next to the galley, it's kind of noisy.

187
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm trying to get some rest.

188
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,870
Yeah?

189
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,210
Okay, the man you're looking for is in seat 12D.

190
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,870
His name is Hans Meyer.

191
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,270
He's with the German government.

192
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,740
He's been connected to Omicron since the mid-1990s.

193
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,170
He's worked directly with Henderson. That's it.

194
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Okay, I've got it.

195
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,570
Mr. Meyer?

196
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,170
Yes?

197
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,770
My name is George Avila. I'm the air marshal on this flight.

198
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,370
- What's wrong?  - It's nothing serious. We found something

199
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
that we think is yours. It should have been

200
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,470
in the baggage compartment.

201
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,770
We'd just like you to come back

202
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,140
to the galley and identify it for us

203
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,440
so we can properly stow it.

204
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,610
Please, sir. We'd really appreciate it.

205
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,770
If you have any carry-on bags, 

206
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,870
you should bring them with you.

207
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,370
I don't.

208
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,270
Very well.

209
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,210
What makes you think it was mine?

210
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,570
Ticket stub.

211
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,070
They have taken away

212
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,340
all my medication. I need to get to it.

213
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,270
I'm sorry, ma'am. They won't let me give that to you.

214
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,070
What do they think I'm going to do? Kill myself?

215
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,170
Over that son of a bitch?!

216
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,470
I just called the president of the United States

217
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,910
a son of a bitch.

218
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,470
No reaction?

219
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,610
He must have some kind of law on the books against that, 

220
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,570
or am I immune, just like he is?

221
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,640
Do you have a first name, Agent Adams?

222
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,210
It's Justin, ma'am.

223
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,140
You don't have much of a personality, do you, Justin?

224
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,810
This is Novick.

225
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,740
It's Martha.

226
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,540
Are you still in the retreat?

227
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,870
Yes. I'm just down the hall from your room.

228
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,170
I need you to come here right away.

229
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,970
I'll be right there.

230
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,670
They've cut me off from my medication.

231
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,110
You haven't been cut off.

232
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,840
Dr. Hill said you had enough

233
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,340
in your system right now.

234
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,240
You need to wait a few hours.

235
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,810
I don't want to wait a few hours, Mike.

236
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,110
I need something now.

237
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,240
What's going on, Mrs. Logan?

238
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,040
I don't need counseling, Mike.

239
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,570
I just want a damn pill.

240
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,470
Sit down. Sit down.

241
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,310
Thank you, Agent Adams.

242
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,440
We've been through some tough times before, Martha.

243
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,510
Just follow the doctor's orders for now.

244
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,610
This is more than just a tough time, Mike.

245
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,570
None of this is going to go away.

246
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,110
I just have to live with it.

247
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,840
What do you mean, "It's not going to go away"?

248
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,370
What are you talking about?

249
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,440
I... I shouldn't have said that.

250
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:46,910
Martha, it's me.

251
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,240
Say what needs to be said.

252
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,410
What needs to be said I can't say to you.

253
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,670
Why not?

254
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,670
Listen, Mike, 

255
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,810
I just... I just need

256
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,410
to get some sleep. I'm just...

257
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,910
My nerves

258
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,770
are shot from today.

259
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,310
I just need something to calm me down.

260
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,770
I just need to get to my medication.

261
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,770
The president doesn't want you to leave the room.

262
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,910
Then you can bring it here.

263
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,670
I just want to take a couple of pills.

264
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,140
I need to sleep.

265
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,140
You can watch me take them.

266
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,640
I'll see what I can do.

267
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,070
Yes?

268
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,740
They found Bauer yet?

269
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,840
No, they haven't.

270
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,870
That's not good.

271
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,970
I know that's not good.

272
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,710
I'm putting pressure everywhere I can.

273
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,270
I don't think I have to tell you how disastrous it would be

274
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,240
if Bauer gets his hands on that recording.

275
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,240
That's exactly right.

276
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,470
You don't have to tell me. I know.

277
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,710
When I find him, I will call you.

278
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,270
Is there anything else?

279
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,570
No.

280
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,140
Good.

281
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,370
Mr. President?

282
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,410
What is it, Mike?

283
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,010
There's something I think I should call to your attention.

284
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,370
Yes?

285
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,770
Your wife is in a very agitated state.

286
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,270
I don't know how to proceed.

287
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,770
Proceed with what?

288
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,640
She wants me to bring her her medication

289
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,240
against doctor's orders.

290
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,940
That's all I need right now is to deal with her!

291
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,540
No! No!

292
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,010
No more pills.

293
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,770
And she shouldn't be wasting your time with this anyway!

294
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,310
Mr. President.

295
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,040
Is there something going on that I should know about?

296
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,610
Why? What did she say?

297
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,210
She needs more medication to calm herself down.

298
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,010
Something's clearly bothering her, 

299
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,070
but she didn't want to talk about it.

300
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,440
I don't see where any of this becomes your business, Mike.

301
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,070
I'll tell you where, Mr. President.

302
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,770
I'm your Chief of Staff.

303
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,270
If there's something going on that I don't know about

304
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,440
that involves national security, it is my business.

305
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,650
This isn't national security, Mike.

306
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,220
It's our marriage.

307
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,090
I think both of us realized today, 

308
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,320
at this point, 

309
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,350
our relationship is nothing more than a facade, 

310
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,450
and one that we're going to have to keep up

311
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,890
for as long as I'm president.

312
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,890
I think that

313
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,650
she's reacting to that, Mike.

314
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,190
I see.

315
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,790
I'm sorry, sir.

316
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,720
Mike?

317
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,920
Give her what she wants.

318
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,990
Lord knows, she's in a lot of pain.

319
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
Where are you hiding it?

320
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,470
Hiding what?

321
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,170
What... What do you want? What the hell is this?

322
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,340
I know who you are.

323
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,140
I know your connection with Omicron.

324
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,510
I know your history with Christopher Henderson.

325
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,710
He asked you to take something

326
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,510
out of the country for him. Where is it?

327
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,970
Christopher Henderson? I have not seen him in months.

328
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,310
Don't you lie to me!

329
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,940
I'm not lying, I swear!

330
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,640
I know Henderson, but I don't know

331
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,670
What you're talking about.

332
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,010
Did you check your luggage?

333
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,340
Yes.

334
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,470
Find it.

335
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,570
Move!

336
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,990
What are you doing?

337
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,390
Nothing.

338
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,490
Homework?

339
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,020
Homework, yeah.

340
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,320
I didn't know they had WiFi in here.

341
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,990
Could you leave me alone?

342
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,350
I can't talk right now.

343
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,950
You're a little, uh, 

344
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,920
freaked out because of the curfew thing.

345
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,320
Join the club.

346
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,120
Yeah, okay.

347
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,450
When you come up for air, I'm buying.

348
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,890
Airport Customs.

349
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,450
This is Chloe O' Brian from CTU Los Angeles.

350
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,850
I need to talk to somebody in passenger clearing.

351
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,120
I'll need verification.

352
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,850
Agency ID: CTU 99A-12.

353
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,720
The captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign, 

354
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,820
as we are expecting some turbulence.

355
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,290
Please return to your seat

356
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,720
and make sure your seat belt is securely fastened.

357
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,720
The passenger in 12D must be in the forward lavatory.

358
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,150
You should get him out.

359
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,850
The captain said it's going to shake pretty hard.

360
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,720
There's nobody in those. I just checked.

361
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,050
Then where is this guy?

362
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,950
I don't know. Maybe he changed seats.

363
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,840
Call the captain, and tell him the air marshal's down, 

364
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,310
and a passenger's missing!

365
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,140
What's going on here?!

366
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,280
Please be seated, sir. Now, sir!

367
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,390
Yeah?

368
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,650
Captain, this is Dan.

369
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,150
The air marshal's been assaulted.

370
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,320
What?

371
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,750
Assaulted?

372
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,920
What's going on back there?

373
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,690
I don't know, sir, but he's been

374
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,490
knocked out, and a passenger's missing.

375
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,920
Okay, okay. Secure the cabin.

376
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,890
Keep the passengers under control.

377
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,720
What's going on?

378
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,220
There's a problem in the cabin.

379
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,650
Make sure our door is secure.

380
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,350
It is. What kind of problem?

381
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
The air marshal's been knocked out.

382
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,220
Call L.A. Center, get vectors

383
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,920
for an emergency return.

384
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,020
Mr. Avila, what happened?

385
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,590
The man seated next to me... where is he?

386
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,090
I didn't see him.

387
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,620
We got to find him.

388
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,220
- Damn it.  - What?

389
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,660
He's got my gun.

390
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,320
Mike, come in.

391
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,290
So, do you have

392
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,820
something for me?

393
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,190
This is just enough for a couple of days.

394
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,250
Dr. Hill's going to come in...

395
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,950
Thank you, Mike.

396
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,890
Thank you.

397
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,690
I'm going to get ready for bed now.

398
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,650
Is there something else?

399
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,690
Yes, there is.

400
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,930
Earlier you said something to the effect

401
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,460
that I didn't know everything that was going on.

402
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,500
I was confused.

403
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,890
I wanted my pills.

404
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,390
I don't think so.

405
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,390
Are you calling me a liar?

406
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,920
I just spoke with the president.

407
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,120
And I got the same feeling from him I get from you.

408
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,620
Which is?

409
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,050
That you're both covering something up.

410
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,820
You know, Mike, I'm the one around here

411
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,090
who's supposed to be paranoid, not you.

412
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,550
I know you, Martha.

413
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,390
And I know the president.

414
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,720
He said this was all about marital difficulties.

415
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,190
I think there's something else.

416
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,890
What is it?

417
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,920
Don't shut me out.

418
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,390
Maybe I can help you.

419
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,190
There is something else, Mike, 

420
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,520
but it's between me and Charles.

421
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,290
If that changes, I promise

422
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,120
I'll let you know.

423
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,790
I don't know what you think Henderson gave me.

424
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,890
I saw no one.

425
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,050
I was picked up at the Consulate

426
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,190
and brought directly here.

427
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,650
There are witnesses, you can ask them.

428
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,150
- Is this your only piece of luggage?  - Yes.

429
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,720
If you're lying to me, I'll find out.

430
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,650
I am not lying.

431
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,590
Please, if there is someone on this plane

432
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,150
that has something you want, it is not me.

433
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,420
Yeah.

434
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,420
Jack, I don't think Hans Meyer is our guy.

435
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,120
Why not?

436
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,550
The timeline doesn't match.

437
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,650
He's been in customs for the last three hours

438
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,890
clearing himself onto the flight.

439
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,620
The plane's turning.

440
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,790
- What does that mean?  - It means they know I'm on board.

441
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,120
- Chloe, keep looking.  - Okay.

442
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,690
Are you sure he's down there?

443
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,120
There's nowhere else he could be.

444
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,250
Tell the pilot

445
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,990
he can do it.

446
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,050
But there's a passenger down there with him. He'll die.

447
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,250
There's over 50 passengers up here. Call him now.

448
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,320
Do it.

449
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,620
Captain, the air marshal says the baggage area

450
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,350
is secure, 

451
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,250
and that you should begin.

452
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,820
Air's coming in.

453
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,250
It's not coming in, it's going out.

454
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,390
What do you mean?

455
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,190
They're depressurizing this area.

456
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,000
What's going to happen to us?

457
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,220
If we don't get into the main cabin, 

458
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,590
we're going to lose consciousness.

459
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,940
Jack, what's going on in the plane? 

460
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,290
Security net just issued a bulletin.

461
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,590
Chloe, I need you to patch me through to the pilot.

462
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,690
I don't know if I can do that.

463
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,250
Chloe, they're depressurizing this area.

464
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,120
We're going to lose consciousness.

465
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,220
Okay, okay.

466
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,420
Yeah, Chloe.

467
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,320
Jack needs us to patch him in to the pilot of the flight.

468
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,050
Can you get through on a CTU sub-channel?

469
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,190
I'll try. Hold on.

470
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,450
I'll stay on the line.

471
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,790
Air control operator 44.

472
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,390
Yes, I need you to patch me through to the pilot

473
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,990
of diplomatic flight five-two-zero out of Van Nuys.

474
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,750
Hey, what do you got?

475
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,950
A little voice-over IP going on there?

476
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,390
Please leave me alone.

477
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,420
No, seriously, I can help.

478
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,550
I know a way for you to get some free bandwidth.

479
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,220
Really?

480
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,450
Absolutely.

481
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,650
Sit down.

482
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,620
Cool.

483
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,090
Wow, nice piece.

484
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,990
Never seen one of these before.

485
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,290
What is that?

486
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,420
It's a CTU Series four.

487
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,850
Chloe, they've opened the line

488
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,050
to the pilot. I'll patch him through.

489
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,690
Thanks. Okay, Jack, I'm putting you on with the pilot.

490
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,620
Go ahead.

491
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,990
This is Captain Stan Cotter.

492
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,220
Who am I speaking to?

493
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,650
Captain, my name is Jack Bauer.

494
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,320
I'm with the Counter Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles.

495
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,820
I'm the man in your baggage hold.

496
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,190
What do you think you're doing?

497
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,350
I'll explain everything in a moment, 

498
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,690
but you're going to have to restore

499
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,450
air pressure to this area.

500
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,620
Sir, I remind you, I am a federal agent.

501
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,850
What kind of a federal agent

502
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,250
knocks out an air marshal?

503
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,550
I don't believe you.

504
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,790
Sir, I was patched through to you by a CTU sub-channel.

505
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,720
I couldn't have done that unless I had clearance.

506
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,520
All I know is, you have a gun

507
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,820
and you have breached airplane security.

508
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,450
Captain, this is a matter of national security.

509
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,350
Now open the damn hatch!

510
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,250
What do you think?

511
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,950
He couldn't have patched in through CTU if he was hostile.

512
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,520
There's no point in taking a chance.

513
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,220
In a couple of minutes he'll pass out.

514
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,950
From there, the air marshal can handle it.

515
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,950
Captain, we are running out of air down here.

516
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,990
Captain, I know you can hear me. There is a man on board

517
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,450
your plane that is a danger to you. That's why I am here.

518
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,590
Open the hatch!

519
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,720
I can't do that.

520
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,090
Okay, you son of a bitch.

521
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,890
What the hell was that?

522
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,020
The aileron conduit's been breached.

523
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,150
- What?!  - What the hell do you think you're doing?

524
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,050
You're going to kill everybody on this plane.

525
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,190
That's up to you.

526
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,000
Open the hatch.

527
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,320
I'm not letting you up here.

528
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,720
Then you'll be responsible for everything that happens.

529
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,090
All right, all right, all right.

530
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,850
Sue, I'm going to stabilize the pressure 

531
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,390
and I'm letting him up.

532
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,050
I want you to unlock the hatch.

533
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,550
The cockpit's secure. He can't get in here.

534
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,190
Yes, Captain.

535
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,330
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

536
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,960
The captain ordered me to open the hatch.

537
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,430
Both of you, turn around and grab the wall.

538
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,900
Now!

539
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,690
You...

540
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,390
in the baggage hold.

541
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,390
Do it.

542
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,590
Now.

543
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,520
Close it.

544
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,790
Lock it.

545
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,520
Take me out of the galley now.

546
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,620
Get back to your seats.

547
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,090
- What's going on?  - Sit down!

548
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,350
He has a gun!

549
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,550
Everybody just stay in your seats.

550
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,020
Face forward. Put your hands on your head.

551
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,890
Do what I tell you and no one will get hurt.

552
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,590
If you don't, people will start to die.

553
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,220
Get the captain on the phone now.

554
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,290
Sir, he's in the main cabin.

555
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,890
He has a gun.

556
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,050
Get the first-class passengers, move them into the main cabin.

557
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,750
Everyone to the main cabin.

558
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,420
Captain, this is Jack Bauer. I want to assure you

559
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,920
I have no intention of hurting any of your passengers.

560
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,650
I need to find something that's on the plane.

561
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,850
- It's a matter of national security.  - What do you want, Bauer?

562
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,750
I want you to remain in a holding pattern

563
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,950
so I can search your passengers.

564
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,220
If you're really a federal agent, 

565
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,150
then you know I have to land this plane.

566
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,750
Sir, that won't give me enough time.

567
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,650
That's not my problem.

568
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,690
I have a gun. Your air marshal is down.

569
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,000
Captain, it is your problem.

570
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,620
You need to remain in a holding pattern, do you understand me?

571
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,450
You do what you have to do, Mr. Bauer.

572
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,350
My job is to land this airplane.

573
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,350
And that is what I am going to do.

574
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,690
Captain? Captain...

575
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,050
That's all we have on Flight 520, sir.

576
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,790
Okay, look, I want updates on the situation

577
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,420
on a minute by minute basis if necessary.

578
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,420
Yes.

579
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,990
I just got word from the FAA

580
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,320
about a hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight that left

581
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,090
Van Nuys a half hour ago.

582
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,090
So what?

583
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,090
Jack Bauer is the hijacker.

584
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,250
What is he doing on that flight?

585
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,020
Looking for the recording that implicates me

586
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,350
in David Palmer's death.

587
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,750
Henderson handed it off to somebody

588
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,050
before he was arrested

589
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,050
and Jack must know that it's on board.

590
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,250
Then you shouldn't be wasting your time talking to me.

591
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,420
Order the plane down, 

592
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,990
and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.

593
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,290
Wait, what are you saying?

594
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,420
That he hijacked the plane?

595
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,850
Not exactly.

596
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,990
He has control of the cabin. The pilot is landing the plane.

597
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,220
What about that recording?

598
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,890
He's still looking for it, 

599
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,290
but there's no guarantee he'll find it before the plane lands.

600
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,550
And after that, it's all over.

601
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,150
The president will have his people

602
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,220
arrest Jack at the airport and isolate him.

603
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,590
What are we supposed to do?

604
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,350
Just keep helping Jack.

605
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,690
Chloe, I need to see that evidence.

606
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,950
Call me if you need anything from here.

607
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,090
Fine.

608
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,790
Give me a second.

609
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,990
What's Bauer doing on Flight 520?

610
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,550
You have no idea what you're dealing with, 

611
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,790
you little ass-kisser.

612
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,390
You don't talk to my people like that, Bill.

613
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,590
Take him to Holding.

614
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,120
It's no wonder CTU fell apart under that guy.

615
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,920
Miles, I know you're trying to help, 

616
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,120
but I'll take it

617
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,050
from here, okay?

618
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,820
Western Operations.

619
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,220
This is Miles Papazian, Homeland Security, Los Angeles.

620
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,720
Pass code 21 double six.

621
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,290
Put me through to Mike Novick.

622
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,020
One moment, please.

623
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,650
Yes, Miles. What is it?

624
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,590
I need your input, sir, because

625
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,150
I'm having a problem with Karen Hayes.

626
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,950
I'd like to preface what I'm about to tell you

627
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,450
by saying that I don't wish to be

628
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,750
- second-guessing...  - I don't have time for prefaces.

629
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,150
Karen Hayes was called in to replace Bill Buchanan.

630
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,150
She was hand-chosen by the vice president

631
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,290
to take that post.

632
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,920
I understand that, sir.

633
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,820
Are you saying you feel she's unfit to do the job?

634
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,520
Four hours ago, 

635
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,950
she relieved Bill Buchanan for ineffectual leadership.

636
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,090
He's been working covertly with Chloe O'Brian

637
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,890
to aid Jack Bauer, a federal fugitive.

638
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,250
Which means Buchanan needs to be dealt with appropriately.

639
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,490
What has Karen done?

640
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,820
She sent in a tac team to pick them both up, 

641
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,090
but by the time they got there, O'Brian was gone.

642
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,920
But instead of having the team

643
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,520
do the interrogation of Buchanan onsite, 

644
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,390
Karen wasted 20 minutes

645
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,390
by bringing him in to CTU.

646
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,690
Maybe she felt the interrogation

647
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,350
would be more effective with CTU resources.

648
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,550
But, sir, she isn't even using rudimentary CTU resources.

649
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,590
She wants to do a soft Q and A by herself.

650
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,250
Any leads we may have had on O'Brian have dried up.

651
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,850
Wait a second, Miles.

652
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,420
I'm not going to pass judgment on Karen Hayes at this point.

653
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,720
She's not interrogating a terrorist.

654
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,490
She's dealing with a high-ranking federal employee.

655
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,720
Sometimes finesse and diplomacy

656
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,590
are better than coercion.

657
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,590
Your concern is duly noted, Miles.

658
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,990
If you'll excuse me, I need to see the president.

659
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,190
Karen.

660
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,790
Shut up, Bill.

661
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,090
We're offline. Now we can talk.

662
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,420
Look, you can continue

663
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,090
this charade of me being under arrest if you want to, 

664
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,320
but Jack needs our help.

665
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,250
And he's getting it, but make no mistake, I am

666
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,490
still in charge of this facility, and until I see

667
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,990
that evidence, I must remain skeptical.

668
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,120
Have you talked to Chloe?

669
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,120
Yes.

670
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,490
What's Jack's status?

671
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,950
He's searching the cabin for the evidence, 

672
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,820
but the pilot is going to land that plane.

673
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,390
How much time does Jack have?

674
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,320
15 minutes.

675
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,150
To search over 50 passengers?

676
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,390
That's impossible.

677
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,950
Ms. Hayes.

678
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,190
Yes.

679
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,890
The president and Mike Novick want an update

680
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,290
on the hijacking of the diplomatic flight.

681
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,250
Put them through.

682
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,650
Go ahead, sir.

683
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,190
Ms. Hayes, this is the president.

684
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,850
Talk to me about 520.

685
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,150
We know that Bauer's involved, but we don't know why.

686
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,320
Isn't it obvious?

687
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,520
Bauer is a fugitive

688
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,620
and he's looking for safe passage out of the country.

689
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,750
Well, that's certainly a possibility, sir.

690
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,820
Listen to me. This man is desperate.

691
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,590
He will say or do anything.

692
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,920
He's not to be trusted.

693
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,250
We need to take him down now, 

694
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,550
dead or alive.

695
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,690
Yes, sir.

696
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,390
Mr. President.

697
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,250
Look. You call the pilot

698
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,920
and you tell him that I don't care

699
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,350
if Bauer is making threats or not, 

700
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,220
that plane has to land immediately.

701
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,450
And when it lands, I want my Secret Service detail

702
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,350
to take him into custody, is that clear?

703
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,790
Ms. Hayes?

704
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,350
Yes, Mr. President.

705
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,290
The president has had knowledge

706
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,950
of everything that's happened today.

707
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,150
He wants that plane down before Jack finds the evidence.

708
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,950
We have to buy him more time.

709
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,820
I don't have the authority to keep that plane from landing.

710
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,690
Sir.

711
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,320
It still doesn't make sense to me.

712
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,090
What?

713
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,420
Jack Bauer has been on the right side

714
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,850
of everything that's happened today, up until now.

715
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,520
Well, right now, he is hijacking a plane.

716
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,090
This man is not stupid.

717
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,090
He's appeared to do the right thing, 

718
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,390
but right now, 

719
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,690
he's backed into a corner, and he's desperate.

720
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,690
Do you really believe that, sir?

721
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,050
I absolutely do.

722
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,090
Bauer's lied to us all day.

723
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,990
He's played us all for fools.

724
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,290
Flight Operations.

725
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,650
This is Chloe O'Brian again.

726
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,290
Yes, Ms. O'Brian.

727
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,690
The copilot, Don Faganson, 

728
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,650
didn't check in when he boarded Flight 520.

729
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,290
Mr. Faganson didn't board.

730
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,420
Why not?

731
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,250
He was replaced at the last minute.

732
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,290
By whom?

733
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,150
Scott Evans, the new copilot.

734
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,650
Here are your things. Go back to your seat.

735
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,250
Yeah.

736
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,290
Jack, it's the copilot, Scott Evans.

737
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,420
How do you know?

738
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,890
He used to fly for Hatton Air.

739
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,120
It's a private charter company

740
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,120
that worked exclusively for Omicron.

741
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,650
Evans was assigned to Henderson's group.

742
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,120
He flew him around for over a year.

743
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,190
Okay, I need you to patch me through to the captain

744
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,120
on a discreet channel so Evans can't hear me.

745
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,090
Okay.

746
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,650
Sit down!

747
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,650
Now!

748
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,290
Everybody stay in your seats

749
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,550
and no one will get hurt!

750
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,150
- Are you OK?  - I'm sorry.

751
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,720
Go ahead.

752
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,520
Captain, this is Jack Bauer.

753
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,390
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.

754
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,620
The person that I'm looking for, 

755
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,250
the man with the evidence that I need, 

756
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,290
is sitting next to you.

757
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,150
He's your copilot, Scott Evans.

758
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,320
That's ridiculous.

759
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,820
Sir, my sources have informed me

760
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,590
that Evans was a last-second replacement.

761
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,450
Can you explain to me why you're not flying

762
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,420
with your regular copilot, Don Faganson?

763
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,920
Captain, Scott Evans has been connected

764
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,820
to a known terrorist.

765
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,220
You need to open the door.

766
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,790
This conversation is over.

767
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,320
Damn it.

768
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,920
What did he want?

769
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,920
He's desperate.

770
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,590
Wants us to land.

771
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,190
This is messed up.

772
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,450
Yeah.

773
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,590
Bad luck for you, huh?

774
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,650
Why?

775
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Well, wasn't Don supposed to have your seat tonight?

776
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,450
Yeah.

777
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,890
What happened to him?

778
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,190
I don't know.

779
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,250
I got the call, so I'm here.

780
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,890
Yeah.

781
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,090
Oh, God.

782
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,850
What's wrong?

783
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,950
Could you, uh...

784
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,990
Could you take the stick for a second?

785
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,850
You okay?

786
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,190
Yeah. I just... got a cramp in my leg.

787
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,290
Yeah. Those are a bitch.

788
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,820
Yeah.

789
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,950
I'm the only one who can fly this plane.

790
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,950
Now, you don't strike me

791
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,790
as a man who's willing to die

792
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,220
for Christopher Henderson.

793
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,390
Give me the recording.

794
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,920
Do it.

795
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,350
Slowly.

796
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,920
Get up.

797
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,250
Get back in your seat.

798
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,250
You're going to land this plane

799
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,420
or I'm going to put a bullet in your head.

800
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,220
Yeah, Jack.

801
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,220
Advise CTU I have the recording.

802
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,150
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.

803
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,950
Got it.

804
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Yes.

805
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,220
Charles.

806
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,390
If I'm going to live with this, 

807
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,420
then you're going to have to help me.

808
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,220
Help you do what, Martha?

809
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,490
Understand.

810
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,290
I...

811
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:33,520
I know you're a good man, 

812
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,220
and that deep down, 

813
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,750
you do what's best for this country.

814
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,850
Of course I do.

815
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,420
Then why...

816
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,550
why didn't you come to me?

817
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,620
I'd have been there for you.

818
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,890
I could have talked you through it.

819
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,950
For God's sake, Martha, for the last three years, 

820
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,120
you've been one click away

821
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,890
from a nervous breakdown every single day, 

822
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,450
and I'm gonna come to you for advice?

823
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,620
I'm gonna have to take another call.

824
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,950
No. Charles, no, no.

825
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,890
We'll talk later.

826
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,650
Yes.

827
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,150
Bauer's got the evidence.

828
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,620
He is in control of the plane.

829
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,120
How do you know that?

830
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,020
We just picked up a call from Chloe O'Brian to Karen Hayes.

831
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,790
What do we do?

832
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:33,250
You are going to have to shoot down that plane, Mr. President.

833
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,550
What?

834
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,290
It's the only option we've got.

835
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,150
Otherwise, you go to prison

836
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,150
for treason and murder.

837
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


838
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,610
We release the Sentox here

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,740
and 200,000 people die.

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,310
We need access to the control room.

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,510
Jack, Bierko will be ready to deploy any minute.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,470
If we could ignite that gas before it leaves the plant,

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,810
the Sentox will be incinerated.

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,410
Bierko!

8
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,040
Give me a hand.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,210
Organize an escort team.

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,740
- You get him back to CTU alive.  - You got it.

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,840
I just word from the FAA

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,740
about a hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight.

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,610
So, what?

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,440
Jack Bauer is the hijacker.

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,540
What was he doing on that flight?

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,270
Looking for the recording that implicates me

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,240
in David Palmer's death.

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,670
Order the plane down and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,910
We need to take him down now, dead or alive.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,410
Mr. President?

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,610
I don't care if Bauer's making threats or not,

22
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,570
that plane has to land immediately.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,770
And when it lands, I want my secret service detail

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,210
to take him into custody.

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,540
- Sit down!  - He has a gun!

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,710
Everybody just stay in your seats!

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,670
Do what I tell you and no one will get hurt!

28
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,840
Captain, this is Jack Bauer.

29
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,940
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,010
The person that I'm looking for, the man with the evidence

31
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,510
that I need, is sitting next to you.

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,140
He's your copilot, Scott Evans.

33
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,010
You need to open the door.

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,840
Could you, uh, take the stick for a second?

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,170
I'm the only one who can fly this plane now!

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,770
Give me the recording.

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,870
Advise CTU I have the recording.

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,840
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.

39
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,370
Bauer's got the evidence.

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,810
He is in control of the plane.

41
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,240
What do we do?

42
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,710
You are going to have to shoot down that plane, Mr. President.

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,670
Otherwise, you'll go to prison

44
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,940
for treason and murder.

45
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,110
Sierra Tango, cleared to flight level 2-2-0, report reaching.

46
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,110
5-2-0, Sierra Tango descend to flight level 2-2-0.

47
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,310
We can expect the approach to Van Nuys.

48
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,640
Good.

49
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,870
This is Jack Bauer.

50
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,340
Can you patch me through to Karen Hayes?

51
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,640
Hold please.

52
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,740
I'm bleeding.

53
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,270
I think you broke my nose.

54
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,840
You'll get medical attention as soon as we're on the ground.

55
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,310
Right now, your only concern should be flying this plane.

56
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,670
Miss Hayes, I've got Jack Bauer on line one.

57
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,140
Put him through.

58
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,710
Yes, Jack?

59
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,570
I've got the recording. It was on the copilot.

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
- The copilot?  - Yeah, he was working for Henderson.

61
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,940
The captain's unconscious, but I've secured the copilot.

62
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,770
We're en route back to Van Nuys airfield.

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,970
What's our ETA?

64
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,640
21 minutes.

65
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,740
We're going to be on the ground in 21 minutes.

66
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,940
Karen, listen to me.

67
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,240
This recording proves that President Logan

68
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,610
was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.

69
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,810
It's imperative that we do not let it fall into the hands

70
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,570
of anyone that is loyal to the president.

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,110
As soon as we're on the ground, I'm going to need you

72
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,340
to provide me with a safe corridor back to CTU.

73
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,040
Jack, it's Bill.

74
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,640
I'm back here with Karen. I'll explain everything later.

75
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,910
We can dispatch a team

76
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,140
to meet you at the airfield.

77
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,440
They can head off any law enforcement,

78
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,840
take you into protective custody.

79
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,910
Okay, good.

80
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,040
Bill, how is Audrey?

81
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,170
Curtis just brought her in. She's in Medical

82
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,470
getting treated, but it looks like she's going to be okay.

83
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,010
Thank God.

84
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,870
Okay, I'll get back to you as soon as we're on final approach. 

85
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,910
All right.

86
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,470
Audrey.

87
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,240
I just got off the phone with County General.

88
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,340
I have some great news.

89
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,970
Your father survived the crash.

90
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,640
He's alive?

91
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,210
Yeah, one of our teams picked him up

92
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,110
about 30 minutes ago at the accident site.

93
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,070
He's still in ICU, but they expect him to pull through.

94
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,140
Oh, my God.

95
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,440
We have a team stationed at the hospital.

96
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,140
He'll be well-protected.

97
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,810
Thank you.

98
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,040
I have to take this.

99
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,540
Curtis?

100
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,510
Thank you so much.

101
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,810
You're welcome.

102
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,010
This is Manning.

103
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,270
Is Henderson secured?

104
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,640
- He's in Holding Room Three.  - Good.

105
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,440
- I need you to take a team to pick up Jack.  - Where is he?

106
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,770
He's on a plane heading towards the Van Nuys airport.

107
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,470
- ETA is 20 minutes.  - Why is he on a plane?

108
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,670
He had to commandeer the plane in order to secure the evidence

109
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,110
against President Logan.

110
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,370
I'll brief you with the details en route.

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,710
Curtis, I cannot emphasize strongly enough

112
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,140
the explosive nature of the evidence that Jack is carrying.

113
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,370
I need you to put him into protective custody

114
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,040
and bring him back here to CTU.

115
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,510
Understood.

116
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,740
President Logan will probably send his men to retrieve it.

117
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,370
You've got to get to Jack first.

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,710
We will. I'm heading out.

119
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,210
Yes?

120
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,710
We have a solution that will allow you

121
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,740
to order the plane shot down.

122
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,340
I sure as hell hope so.

123
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,770
I may be the president, but there are protocols in place

124
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,110
that I can't just ignore.

125
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,440
What we're proposing will circumvent your protocols.

126
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,870
What is it?

127
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,170
We're going to simulate a VCI distress signal.

128
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,510
It'll be broadcast on the airplane's transponder code,

129
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,010
and it will appear to come from Bauer's flight.

130
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,870
Hold on. What is a VCI distress signal?

131
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,710
It's an emergency signal indicating that there's a hijacking in progress,

132
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,510
and that the perpetrators intend to use the aircraft as a weapon.

133
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,210
It'll give you the pretext to shoot it down.

134
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,310
There really is no other legitimate response

135
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,340
to this scenario, Mr. President.

136
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,940
All you need to do is appear to struggle with the ethics

137
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,610
and then give the order.

138
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,910
Mr. President?

139
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,740
Fine.

140
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,740
All right.

141
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,410
You sound reluctant.

142
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,310
I can't believe it's come to this.

143
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,010
I'm going to shoot down a plane

144
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,410
full of innocent people.

145
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,940
None of us is happy about this, Mr. President,

146
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,240
but you don't really have a choice.

147
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,610
Bauer has evidence implicating you in this conspiracy,

148
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,540
and I don't have to tell you what the consequences will be

149
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,170
for all of us if it's released.

150
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,010
We should contact Chloe and bring her in.

151
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,610
We're going to want her help

152
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,810
bringing Jack back to CTU.

153
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,640
Fine.

154
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,940
Send an escort.

155
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,840
Karen, I appreciate this.

156
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,310
I know you're putting

157
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,940
everything on the line to help us.

158
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,140
All I can say is this recording better be

159
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,310
- everything Jack claims it is.  - I know Jack.

160
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,510
I don't always agree with his methods,

161
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,310
but I trust his judgment.

162
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,840
I'll go make that call.

163
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,040
What's going on?

164
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,310
What's Buchanan doing out of Holding?

165
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,470
The situation has changed, Miles.

166
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,270
There's some new intel.

167
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,670
I haven't seen anything. What new intel?

168
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,340
I don't have time to explain it right now.

169
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,770
What does that mean?

170
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,670
It means that I'll brief you when I've got the chance.

171
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,870
Have you compiled the orders for Bierko's transfer?

172
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,640
I'm still working on them.

173
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,210
Let me know when you've got them.

174
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,510
What is it, Mike?

175
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,710
A situation has come up regarding the hijacked plane.

176
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,140
Tell me what's happening.

177
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,640
The FAA just picked up a VCI distress code.

178
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,510
It originated from flight ST-520.

179
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,340
What's a VCI distress code?

180
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,340
The VCI is a coding system that was recently installed

181
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,210
on all commercial airliners.

182
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,640
This particular code indicates that a hijacking is underway,

183
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,740
and that the plane is going to be used

184
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,040
to target installations on the ground.

185
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,810
Oh, my God.

186
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,240
Admiral Kirkland is standing by

187
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,670
on video-conference from Point Mugu.

188
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,470
He's ready to brief you with the details.

189
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,510
Admiral Kirkland, I'm Mike Novick.

190
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,910
I have the President here.

191
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,410
Mr. President.

192
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,310
Admiral. Mike's told me about this VCI signal.

193
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,870
How could it have been sent

194
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,340
without Bauer's knowledge?

195
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,510
Most likely, one of the pilots under duress secretly activated

196
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,010
the transponder code.

197
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,510
Let me get this straight.

198
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,610
At last report, Bauer was in the passenger cabin.

199
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,440
Does this mean that he's now in the cockpit

200
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,010
and that he's in control of the plane?

201
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,940
It appears that way, sir.

202
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,940
What do we do, Admiral?

203
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,010
Sir, the protocols for this scenario are clearly specified.

204
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,170
We're compelled to take preemptive action.

205
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,970
What action?

206
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,770
The aircraft must be shot down.

207
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,140
We've already scrambled an F-18 out of Point Mugu.

208
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,910
We just need your approval to engage.

209
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,540
There are over 50 people on that plane, Admiral.

210
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,970
We have to think of the people on the ground, Mr. President.

211
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,410
Over 20 million citizens live in Los Angeles County,

212
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,740
each one of them is now a potential target.

213
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,810
I don't believe this.

214
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,810
Mr. President, if I can interject.

215
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,010
Admiral, it's hard for me to accept

216
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,410
that Bauer intends to use the aircraft as a weapon

217
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,770
against civilians.

218
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,240
From my briefing document,

219
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,840
Jack Bauer is a distraught individual

220
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,140
with a history of erratic behavior.

221
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,240
Jack Bauer has spent his entire career

222
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,710
protecting American lives.

223
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,470
I think there's a reason he's doing what he's doing.

224
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,940
What would that be?

225
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,510
I don't have the answer,

226
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,510
but we should at least try to find out.

227
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,070
We don't have the time.

228
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,070
Mr. President, we could have the F-18

229
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,410
shadow the aircraft.

230
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,410
We could issue a standing order

231
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,240
to fire only if the target deviates

232
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,540
from its present course.

233
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,170
That's not a viable option, Mr. President.

234
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
Why not?

235
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,010
Right now, that plane is over the desert.

236
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,040
In another 15 minutes, it'll be above Los Angeles.

237
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,640
If we're forced to shoot it down then,

238
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,970
there'll be facing massive casualties on the ground.

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,510
And, Mr. President, we must also consider

240
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,840
the possibility that Bauer intends to attack

241
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,410
the Presidential Retreat.

242
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,810
The Retreat?

243
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,270
You're inside the target zone,

244
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,670
and Bauer's already been accused of killing one president today.

245
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,970
The simple fact is, sir,

246
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,470
we don't know what his intentions are.

247
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,670
Mr. President...

248
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,170
Mike. Stop.

249
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,310
I've made my decision.

250
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,210
Admiral, I'm authorizing you to shoot down that plane.

251
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,410
Yes, sir.

252
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,510
Mr. President...

253
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,740
Mike, please.

254
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,270
Don't make this any more difficult for me

255
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,070
than it already is.

256
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,870
Miss Hayes.

257
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,810
This just came in over the interagency sub-net.

258
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,770
What is it?

259
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
We have to alert Jack.

260
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,710
This is Bauer.

261
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,540
Jack, air traffic control just received a VCI distress signal

262
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,970
from your aircraft.

263
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,140
That effectively authorizes President Logan

264
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,210
to shoot you down.

265
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,340
Shoot us down?

266
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,670
And F-18's been scrambled

267
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,970
out of Point Mugu, Jack.

268
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,170
You have eight to ten minutes at best.

269
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,970
Can you patch me through to the pilot

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,010
of the F-18?

271
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,010
No chance.

272
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,270
They're on a coded frequency.

273
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,310
We can try to get in touch with the White House.

274
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,940
And tell them what?

275
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,840
They don't want to hear anything I have to say.

276
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,840
Hold on.

277
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,170
We need to land this plane now.

278
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,610
We're 100 miles from the nearest airport.

279
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,640
They just scrambled an F-18 to shoot us out of the sky.

280
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,040
We need to get on the ground now!

281
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,410
You didn't hear me.

282
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,540
There's nowhere to land.

283
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,940
How much runway do you need?

284
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,710
At least 5,000 feet.

285
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,870
Bill, do you hear me?

286
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,040
Yeah, Jack.

287
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,740
I need you to look for a stretch of freeway

288
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,310
5,000 feet long, straight enough for us to land on.

289
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,510
I'll pull up maps

290
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,240
in the area, Jack. It'll take a few seconds.

291
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,770
Get back to me as soon as

292
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,940
you've got something.

293
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,270
We can't land on the freeway.

294
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,570
Yes, we can.

295
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,270
It's late, there's a curfew.

296
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,970
There won't be any cars on the freeway.

297
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,440
Cuff your right hand

298
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,310
to the flight control, now.

299
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
All the way.

300
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,200
Start taking us down.

301
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,800
Do it now.

302
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,800
what's Chloe O'brian doing here?

303
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,100
I don't know.

304
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,100
You can go.

305
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,400
What's going on?

306
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,800
An f-18's been scrambled to shoot down Jack's plane.

307
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,300
Can you open up a socket with the ATC radar tracking plot?

308
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,300
Yeah, I think so.

309
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,800
Do it, Chloe.

310
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,200
We need to know the exact amount of time Jack has before the fighter plane reaches him.

311
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,700
Okay.

312
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,500
Karen, look at this.

313
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,200
Two possible landing sites.

314
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,900
I think this one's the best shot.

315
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,500
I agree.

316
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,900
Let's get Jack on the phone.

317
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
I need to speak with you.

318
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
We need to make an emergency landing.

319
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Talk to your passengers and get them ready.

320
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,200
What's happening?

321
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Don't worry.

322
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,700
Everything's gonna be fine.

323
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,600
Just get them ready.

324
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,500
Okay.

325
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,200
Okay.

326
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,300
Listen up, everybody.

327
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,700
We're going to prepare for an emergency landing.

328
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,500
The proper procedure...

329
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,200
it's Bauer.

330
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,900
Jack, it's Bill,

331
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,200
I think we found something.

332
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Bill, hold on one sec.

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,300
I want to put you on speakerphone.

334
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,100
Go ahead.

335
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,200
It's a stretch of the 118 freeway between mile marker 91 and 92.

336
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
There's about 4,000 feet,

337
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,600
then there's an overpass.

338
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,700
That's not long enough.

339
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,100
It's the best we can do.

340
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,700
Copy that, bill.

341
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,400
Hold on, give me a second.

342
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,400
You can either try and land this plane on the freeway or I will.

343
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,500
Give me the coordinates.

344
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,300
3-4-5-0.2 north by 1-1-0-3-0.4 west.

345
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
We need to know where that f-18 is.

346
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,100
Jack, it's Chloe.

347
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm working on it.

348
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,500
Manning.

349
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,900
We have the exact location where Jack's putting down.

350
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,600
Go ahead.

351
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,100
It's the 118 freeway between mile markers 91 and 92.

352
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,400
He should be on the ground within minutes.

353
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,100
Copy.

354
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,200
We're redirecting.

355
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,500
118 freeway.

356
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Mr. President, we're five minutes away.

357
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,100
I'm patching us in directly with the pilot of the f-18.

358
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Go ahead.

359
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,300
Bravo one,

360
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,000
this is Admiral Kirkland.

361
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
You're on with the president and myself.

362
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,100
Report status.

363
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,300
My radar is locked onto the target.

364
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,900
Okay, I've got the atc radar plot.

365
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,500
Put it on the main screen.

366
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,500
Jack, the f-18 is within 15 miles.

367
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,000
They're not gonna make it.

368
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
He's gonna be within the missile range in two minutes.

369
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
You're not descending fast enough.

370
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,500
If we increase the descent rate,

371
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
we won't be able to pull out of the dive.

372
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,900
If we don't get on the ground before that f-18 reaches us,

373
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,500
it's not gonna matter. Descend now!

374
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,100
Put the oxygen masks on!

375
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,300
Target has increased angle and rate of descent.

376
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,500
One minute from missile lock.

377
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,300
Jack, they're almost within weapons range.

378
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,600
The aircraft can't take this.

379
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,700
I have to pull up.

380
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,900
Not yet!

381
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,500
I can see the freeway!

382
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,500
Come on.

383
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,400
Okay, level up now!

384
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,500
Now!

385
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
We can't pull out of the dive!

386
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,500
I need your help!

387
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Pull!

388
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
ground proximity alert.

389
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,900
20 seconds to missile lock.

390
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,800
Target's at 1,000 feet and leveling.

391
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,500
Leveling?

392
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,500
Affirmative, sir.

393
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,100
What does that mean?

394
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,300
Target may be preparing to land.

395
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,100
The objective seems to be the 118 freeway.

396
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,100
Lower the landing gear!

397
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,000
We're going too fast!

398
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,300
Lower it!

399
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,900
He's lowering his landing gear.

400
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
The f-18's in range.

401
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,800
I have missile lock.

402
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
The aircraft is in a landing profile,sir.

403
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
I recommend we abort.

404
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

405
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The parameters have changed, sir.

406
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
I want that plane shot down!

407
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,100
Sir...

408
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,000
order your man to fire, now!

409
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,300
Mr. President!

410
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,500
Admiral Kirkland is right.

411
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,800
The aircraft's not a threat.

412
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,500
There's no reason to do this.

413
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,100
I implore you to reconsider.

414
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,500
Sir, we have locked, wait your orders.

415
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,300
Abort.

416
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes, sir.

417
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,300
But if they don't land,

418
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,600
I want you to shoot that plane down immediately!

419
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
Yes, Mr. President.

420
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,500
Bravo one,hold fire.

421
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
I repeat, hold fire.

422
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,700
Copy, base.

423
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,200
Bravo one holding fire.

424
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
We have marine units deployed in the area.

425
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,700
I want them to cordon off the landing site

426
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,600
and apprehend Jack Bauer.

427
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,500
Yes,sir.

428
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,500
500 feet!

429
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,500
We're not gonna make it.

430
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,500
Come on.

431
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Ctu.

432
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,600
CTU, We've spotted the plane.

433
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
They're coming in for a landing.

434
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
We're heading towards them now.

435
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,500
I'm handing the controls back to you!

436
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,400
Touch it down!

437
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,500
We're still going too fast!

438
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,300
Touch it down!

439
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,400
target has touched down.

440
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,100
I'm clear.

441
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,300
Returning to base.

442
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,300
Bill, we made it.

443
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,500
We're down on the ground.

444
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,400
Jack, we've redirected Curtis to your location.

445
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
He should be there in a few minutes.

446
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm just east of the balboa overpass.

447
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
Have him meet me there.

448
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Send a secondary team to pick up the copilot

449
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,900
Got it.

450
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,300
Get out of there,Jack!

451
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
Everyone, keep moving to the rear of the plane!

452
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,100
Exit from the rear,now!

453
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,900
You should have followed through,Mr. President.

454
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,200
You should have orderehould have ordered that pilot to fire.

455
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,900
They were landing on a freeway.

456
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,800
I had no pretext to shoot them down.

457
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
I had to abort.

458
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,100
It's going to be much harder to contain now,

459
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,000
if not impossible.

460
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,700
Bauer's on the ground.

461
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,000
He won't get far.

462
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,800
Even before the plane touched down,

463
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,600
I ordered two battalions of marines into the area.

464
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,900
They're cordoning off the landing site, even as we speak.

465
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,200
Bauer...

466
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,600
has nowhere to run.

467
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,100
I hope you're right, Mr. President.

468
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,000
This is our last chance.

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,800
If Bauer gets through...

470
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,200
I know.

471
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,600
I know what's at stake, Graham.

472
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll get back to you as soon as I have any news.

473
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,800
Curtis, it's Jack!

474
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,300
Go ahead.

475
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,200
The marines are moving in.

476
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
They're setting up a perimeter.

477
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,200
Where are you?

478
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,400
We're approaching your position from the north.

479
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,800
Okay, I got you.

480
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,200
I'll meet you on the north side of the freeway.

481
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,520
they know I'm still in the area. We got to get out of here.

482
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,720
Head south on Variel. Move.

483
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,780
Damn it. You're gonna have to try and talk your way through the roadblock.

484
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,280
Get your hands up!

485
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,100
Hands where we can see them.

486
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,300
We're federal agents.

487
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,950
Los angeles Counter Terrorist Unit.

488
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,830
We've been given orders to detain everybody inside this perimeter.

489
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,580
We're all on the same team here, Commander. We're trying to apprehend the suspect who hiJacked that plane.

490
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,240
- Jack Bauer?  - That's right. Now, let us do our job.

491
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,840
I need to see individual ID's. I'm gonna call this in.

492
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,810
We don't have time for this, commander. The longer we sit here,the better chance Bauer has of slipping through the net.

493
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,420
- This will only take a few minutes.  - A few minutes is all Bauer needs to escape.

494
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,530
We're not prepared to let that happen.

495
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,920
Now we're moving out. If you really want to fire on federal agents, that's your call.

496
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,980
Stand down.

497
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,420
Move out.

498
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,500
Stand down!

499
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,560
Head east for a while, then turn south.

500
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,970
Yes,sir.

501
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,050
- Buchanan.  - It's Curtis.

502
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,630
- We've got Jack, and we're headed back in.  - Okay, Curtis.

503
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,660
Marines are all over the place. Barely got past one of the patrols.

504
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,790
They must be taking direct orders from Logan. There's no other explanation.

505
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,010
We can't take the chance of running into any more of these patrols.

506
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,930
- We'll stick to the back streets.  - Understood.

507
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,430
Hayes.

508
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,250
I want to know what's going on.

509
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,540
Miles,I told you I would tell you when I felt the time was right.

510
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,450
I'm sitting here watching you work with two people under arrest for aiding and abetting a federal fugitive.

511
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,560
If you don't talk to me, I'll have to get my answers somewhere else.

512
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,290
I'll be right there.

513
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,250
- You can't tell him.  - I can't hold him off any longer.

514
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,420
You really think that's a good idea?

515
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,280
I have to trust him.

516
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,440
He's been nothing but loyal.

517
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,290
I probably shouldn't have kept him in the dark this long.

518
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,900
I'll be right back.

519
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,090
I don't appreciate being threatened,miles.

520
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,620
And I don't appreciate being shut out.

521
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,700
We've worked a lot of years together, Karen,

522
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,910
and I have never waveredin my allegiance.

523
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,360
I don't deserve this.

524
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,510
No, you don't.

525
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,360
Come with me.

526
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:04,660
Jack Bauer's acquired evidence implicating president Logan in David Palmer's death.

527
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,440
- Have you seen this evidence?  - No, but Bauer's bringing it here now.

528
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,720
What is it?

529
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,110
It's a recording of a conversation between the president and an accomplice.

530
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,250
- But you haven't heard it?  - No.

531
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,110
And that's what you're doing with Buchanan and O'brian?

532
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,300
Covertly helping Bauer?

533
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,980
Yes.

534
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,630
For the past three hours, President Logan has done everything in his power to keep Jack from getting back here alive.

535
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,530
You're working against the most powerful man in the world,

536
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,920
and you haven't actually heard the evidence.

537
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,600
- This is why I didn't talk to you,miles.  - Because you knew I'd talk you out of it.

538
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,660
Yes,I know what I'm doing is risky.If I am wrong, my career is over.I could be brought up on charges.

539
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,940
Not just your career, Karen.

540
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,150
I am doing this because I believe that Bauer is telling the truth.

541
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,490
But you don't know.

542
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,390
Okay, okay.

543
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,510
Let's say he is.

544
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,420
Let's say that recording implicates Logan.

545
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,690
Then what are you going to do?

546
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,840
Are you going to arrest the president of the united states?

547
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,130
That will be up to the Attorney General.

548
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,170
- You're depending on...  - I'm sorry to interrupt.

549
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,240
- Yes.  - They're ready to move Bierko.

550
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,280
Thank you. I'll be right out.

551
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,130
Look, I have to go over the transfer protocols.

552
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,150
I know that what I'm asking from you is difficult.

553
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,100
Everything rests with what's on that recording.

554
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,170
Tell me what you need.

555
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,850
Bauer will be here any minute.

556
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,940
The best way for you to help me is to go back out there and keep things running smoothly.

557
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,540
- All right.  - Miles?

558
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,240
- It's imperative this stay between us.  - Of course.

559
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Thank you.

560
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,210
Thank you.

561
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,220
We have a full tactical complement, enhanced ordinance package, two vehicle escort.

562
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,280
Vladimir Bierko, you're being transferred to a primary holding facility at our district headquarters.

563
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,840
- Let me know the second he arrives.  - Understood.

564
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,280
Let's move out.

565
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,480
Let's go.

566
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,240
- Where the hell is Mike Novick?  - He's moments away, sir.

567
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,400
You told me that three minutes ago.

568
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,950
Yes, sir.

569
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,970
I'm sorry, Mr. President. I was on the phone with Colonel Owens.

570
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,950
He's the marine field commander on the site.

571
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,020
- Is Bauer in custody?  - No, sir.

572
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,880
What happened?

573
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,040
As ordered, the marines sealed off a one-mile radius around the landing site.

574
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,770
They've completed a sweep of the area.

575
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,260
And?

576
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,040
And it's Colonel Owens' estimation that

577
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,770
Bauer is no longer inside the perimeter.

578
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,660
- He got away.  - It appears so, sir.

579
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,430
I can't believe this.

580
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,920
Uh, Mr. President, it's only a matter of time before Bauer's apprehended.

581
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,390
Sir, are you all right?

582
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,450
Thank you, Mike. I need some time alone now.

583
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,260
Jack, the Attorney General's on his way to his office right now.

584
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,530
He'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes.

585
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,380
Okay, good. Chloe, I want you to prepare the recording for playback.

586
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,120
I want you to clean it up and apply a digital signature so that we can establish a chain of evidence.

587
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,520
- Okay.  - You need to work alone.

588
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,300
I don't want anyone else near that recording. 

589
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
You don't ever let it out of your sight.

590
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,620
- I won't.  - You said I had ten minutes.

591
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,270
- I'd like to see Audrey.  - Of course. She's in medical.

592
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,180
Thank you.

593
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,820
No ma'am. He is still in ICU

594
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,570
Well, when will I be able to speak with him?

595
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,550
- Sorry, I really don't know.  - All right, I understand.

596
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,540
Well, just let him know...

597
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,070
can you please tell him that his daughter called and that...

598
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,340
she loves him very much.

599
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,970
Thank you.

600
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,100
It looks like my dad's gonna be all right.

601
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,430
Yeah, I know, I heard.

602
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,660
Oh, God, I'm so glad to see you.

603
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,760
Me, too.

604
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,200
We did it.

605
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,390
We got the evidence.

606
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,460
The attorney general's going to hear it.

607
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,800
So it's over?

608
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,360
Yeah.

609
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,330
President Logan's going to pay

610
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,730
for David Palmer's assassination.

611
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,730
Thank you.

612
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,330
Close your eyes.

613
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,730
I'm going to sit with you for a minute.

614
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,130
Yes.

615
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,760
Graham.

616
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,360
I've been trying to reach you.

617
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,760
I know.

618
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,230
Bauer slipped through the cordon, didn't he? 

619
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,260
Yes.

620
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,700
I've just been told that the attorney general's office

621
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,290
received a phone call from the director of CTU.

622
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,600
I think it's fairly obvious

623
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,760
they're in possession of the recording.

624
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,430
I think that phone call was about you.

625
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,830
I didn't expect it would to happen so soon.

626
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,630
I am sorry, Charles.

627
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,130
You don't deserve this.

628
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,060
Listen, Graham, despite how things turned out...

629
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,230
I still believe that we were in the right.

630
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,630
I still believe that we acted

631
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,100
in the best interest of the country.

632
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,360
And we have to keep putting the country's well-being

633
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,800
ahead of our own.

634
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,800
The spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder

635
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,030
would be devastating.

636
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,900
Yes. Yes, it would.

637
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,730
Aside from the psychological damage to the country,

638
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,430
a trial would expose certain realities

639
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,260
that should never see the light of day.

640
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,500
If only we could keep such a trial from taking place.

641
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,630
That thought occurred to me, as well.

642
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,360
I'm glad we agree.

643
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,630
I want you to know I've taken steps to ensure

644
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,560
that you and your associates

645
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,230
won't be implicated in any of this.

646
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,860
I appreciate that, Charles.

647
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,360
We all do.

648
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,760
There's nothing more to say.

649
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,660
I'm going to hang up now.

650
00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:00,360
There are, uh, a few things I'd like to take care of before...

651
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,430
Good-bye, Charles.

652
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,230
Good-bye, Graham.

653
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,830
Martha, may I come in?

654
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
Now you want to talk?

655
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,860
Marti, please?

656
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,060
What do you want?

657
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,990
Is there something else you want to confess?

658
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,430
No.

659
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,230
I want to tell you how sorry I am...

660
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,230
for everything.

661
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,890
When you forget to give me something for my birthday,

662
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,430
that's when you say you're sorry.

663
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,800
I know what I did was wrong.

664
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,800
It was horribly wrong and unforgivable.

665
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,530
I know that.

666
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,260
But what I can't live with is the fact that I hurt you.

667
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,830
That's the last thing. I wanted to do.

668
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,730
Marti?

669
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,990
Marti, please.

670
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,260
That's the truth.

671
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,300
The truth.

672
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,530
You know what really gets me, Charles?

673
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,630
What?

674
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,630
That you had me going for so long.

675
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,130
I had no idea you were such a good liar.

676
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,490
If I wasn't so horrified by the fact that I'm married to you,

677
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,490
I might actually be impressed.

678
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,100
Yes.

679
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,060
I have an urgent call for you, sir.

680
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,930
He says his name is Miles Papazian from CTU.

681
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,760
I don't want to talk to anyone from CTU.

682
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,700
He insists that you'll want to speak to him.

683
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,630
He says it's about Jack Bauer.

684
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,430
Put him through.

685
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,430
You're on with the President.

686
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,790
Mr. President?

687
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,330
Yes, go ahead.

688
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,360
You don't know me; my name is Miles Papazian.

689
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,300
I work under Karen Hayes.

690
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,000
What is this about?

691
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,300
It's about a recording, sir,

692
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,960
that Jack Bauer has just delivered here to CTU.

693
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,730
Sir, my understanding is it's a recording

694
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,530
of a conversation of yours that, if leaked,

695
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:01,200
could significantly compromise national security.

696
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,000
Go on.

697
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,030
My superior, Ms. Hayes,

698
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,300
is working with Bauer and Bill Buchanan.

699
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,790
Their intention is to play the recording for the attorney general.

700
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,660
Why are you telling me this?

701
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,690
Because, sir... I feel compelled to intervene.

702
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,390
And I just I wanted to make sure that you would approve.

703
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:36,130
I do, Mr. Papazian, I do approve.

704
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,730
Listen, I'm going to text you... my private number.

705
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,730
Let me know how it goes.

706
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,000
And, Miles...

707
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,790
... I promise you, I won't forget this.

708
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,160
Thank you, sir.

709
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,130
That's all I wanted to hear.

710
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,760
Mr. President, I look forward to speaking with you again soon.

711
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,430
Karen wants to know how long

712
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,260
before the teleconference starts?

713
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,590
Five minutes... get out of here, Miles.

714
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,590
We'll be ready?

715
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,360
Not if you keep interrupting me.

716
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,730
I'm just doing my job, Chloe.

717
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,260
Well, if your job

718
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:57,000
is to slow things down, then you're doing really good work.

719
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,930
I'll tell Karen. you'll be ready.

720
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,100
Thanks.

721
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


722
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,090
This is Bauer.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,190
Jack, Air Traffic Control

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,900
just received a VCI distress signal

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,760
from your aircraft that effectively authorizes

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,430
President Logan to shoot you down.

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,830
Start taking us down.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,900
Do it now.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,930
Jack, the F-18 is within 15 miles.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
My radar is locked onto the target.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,900
Lower the landing gear!

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,900
We're going too fast!

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,030
Touch it down!

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,490
We're ready to move Bierko.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,430
Thank you.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,830
I'll be right out.

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,800
Vladimir Bierko, you're being transferred

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,360
to a primary holding facility in our district headquarters.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,430
Jack, the attorney general is on his way

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,030
to his office right now.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,660
He'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes.

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,190
Chloe, I want you to prepare

22
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,430
the recording for playback.

23
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,430
I want you to clean it up

24
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,130
and apply a digital signature

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,460
so we can establish a chain of evidence.

26
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,490
You work alone.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,190
We got the evidence.

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,760
President Logan's going to pay

29
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,030
for David Palmer's assassination.

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,190
The spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder

31
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,800
would be devastating.

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,630
Yes, it would.

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,130
If only there were a way that

34
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,990
we could prevent such a trial from taking place.

35
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,590
Mr. President?

36
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,960
You don't know me.

37
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,230
My name is Miles Papazian, I work under Karen Hayes.

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,000
What is this about?

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,730
It's about a recording, sir,

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,290
if leaked, could significantly compromise national security.

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,630
Why are you telling me this?

42
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,860
I feel compelled to intervene,

43
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,960
and I just I wanted to make sure

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,000
that you would approve.

45
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,330
I do, Mr. Papazian,

46
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,130
I do approve.

47
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,290
Get out of here, Miles.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,130
I'm just doing my job, Chloe.

49
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,190
Well, if your job is is to slow things down,

50
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,860
then you're doing really good work.

51
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,900
I'll tell Karen you'll be ready.

52
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,730
The attorney general will be on the line in five minutes.

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,130
Did you tell him that the recording

54
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,190
implicates President Logan in Palmer's assassination?

55
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,660
No. I feel he needs to hear it directly from the source.

56
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,630
Fine.

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,130
We're minutes away, Chloe, what's your status?

58
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,530
Everything is set up.

59
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,800
I've got a T-1 line hooked in to the attorney general,

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,060
the other two lines are secured on dedicated channels.

61
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,530
What other two lines?

62
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,590
We're patching in a representative

63
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,530
from the House Judiciary Committee

64
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,530
and a Congressional liaison.

65
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,230
We need their support to call for

66
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,460
an emergency session of Congress

67
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,430
to begin impeachment proceedings.

68
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,460
Impeachment proceedings?

69
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,860
What about an arrest warrant?

70
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,630
We'll never get Justice to indict a sitting president.

71
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,630
Removing him from office is a necessary step

72
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,360
to begin full criminal prosecution.

73
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,230
All right, Chloe, let's check the sound levels.

74
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,290
Play the recording.

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,700
What's wrong?

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,700
I don't know.

77
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,630
What do you mean you don't know?

78
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,760
Where's the recording?

79
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,260
This is what's on the digital medium.

80
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,630
That's impossible.

81
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,130
See if there's an overlay, check your connections.

82
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,930
There are no mistakes.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,330
Damn it, Chloe, you were responsible for this recording.

84
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,330
What the hell happened?

85
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,760
I just told you, I don't know.

86
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,160
But if there was something on this memory chip,

87
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,160
it's been erased.

88
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,590
Yes?

89
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,900
Excuse me, Ms. Hayes.

90
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,460
The attorney general's holding on the line.

91
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,530
- Ms. Hayes?  - I heard you.

92
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,060
Bill Buchanan will take the call in a moment.

93
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,760
I'll tell him we're having technical difficulties,

94
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,630
we need to postpone the conference.

95
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,060
Someone got to that recording.

96
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,260
Perhaps it was damaged in your attempts to retrieve it.

97
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,630
It wasn't.

98
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,260
Chloe, who had access to this room?

99
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,760
- No one.  - Someone did!

100
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,960
Who had access to this room... think about it!

101
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,590
- Miles was in here.  - What?

102
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,290
You sent him in here to check up on me

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,330
while I was setting up.

104
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,760
I never sent him in here!

105
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Jack...

106
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,360
Security, stop Mr. Bauer.

107
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,860
Mr. Bauer!

108
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,000
Jack, stop!

109
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,060
You son of a bitch.

110
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,290
Let go of me, Bauer.

111
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,160
Do you know how many people lost their lives

112
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,630
so I could bring that evidence in?

113
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

114
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,490
We know it was you.

115
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,000
Let him go, Jack.

116
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Jack, let him go!

117
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,590
Where are you going, Miles?

118
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,360
I've been transferred.

119
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,830
I was told to report immediately.

120
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,000
The order should be coming through any minute.

121
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,560
Transferred to where?

122
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,030
The White House.

123
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,130
How could you do this, Miles?

124
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,560
This is not over.

125
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,630
There will be an investigation.

126
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,960
Do what you have to do, Karen...

127
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,700
... but I work for the president now.

128
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,530
Jack, I'm so sorry.

129
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,900
I don't know how he did it,

130
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,290
he didn't even touch the recorder.

131
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,900
Karen, Audrey Raines heard the recording

132
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,260
when I played it for Secretary Heller.

133
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,630
I know that she will sign an affidavit...

134
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,900
Jack, not now.

135
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Chloe, take the recorder down to Processing.

136
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,630
Break down the memory chip and see if

137
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,800
- you can restore anything.  - Fine.

138
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,000
Ms. Hayes?

139
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
The president's calling for you.

140
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,360
Line two.

141
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,730
Mr. President.

142
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
Karen

143
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,730
what's this I hear about a conference call

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,230
you've scheduled with the attorney general?

145
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,390
Is there some problem I should know about?

146
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,130
It's nothing, sir, a mistake.

147
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,000
The conference call was canceled.

148
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,630
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

149
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,260
Listen, the real reason for my call is Jack Bauer.

150
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,190
What about Jack Bauer?

151
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,160
I'm embarrassed to say that after further review,

152
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,490
it appears that the evidence against him is, at best, inconclusive.

153
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,530
Now, we'll have our lawyers

154
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,930
continue to work on it, of course,

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,800
but for the time being, I'm suspending the arrest order.

156
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,530
You're dropping the charges against Bauer?

157
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,490
That's correct.

158
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,930
Mr. President, you have had this office, other agencies,

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,130
and the military dedicate all manpower and resources

160
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,430
into apprehending Jack Bauer.

161
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes. Based on evidence I initially thought was credible.

162
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,260
And now I have new information

163
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,960
that's convinced me that the original intel was faulty.

164
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,760
Am I to release Bauer, sir?

165
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,490
I'll leave that to your discretion.

166
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,260
Thank you, Karen. Good work.

167
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,560
We'll be in touch.

168
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes, Mr. President.

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,130
He's letting me go because he knows he's won.

170
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,900
What does he gain by releasing you?

171
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,490
I'll be on my own.

172
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,330
Alone, unprotected, a perfect target.

173
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,560
Word just came in... Bierko's escaped.

174
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,360
What?!

175
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,660
How long ago?!

176
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,190
The convoy that was moving him to District was hit

177
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,360
about ten minutes ago.

178
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,130
They took out all our agents except one:

179
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,560
Davis, on line three.

180
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,290
Davis, Karen Hayes. What happened?

181
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Our lead car got taken out by an IED.

182
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,430
I counted six attackers.

183
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,730
Bierko got away

184
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,030
before I could call in backup.

185
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,330
Did you see the vehicle?

186
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,360
Negative.

187
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,030
I blacked out when I took one in the shoulder.

188
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,590
There's a medevac team on the way.

189
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,860
Before I lost consciousness,

190
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,330
I overheard Bierko talking to his men.

191
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,460
He said they're not finished.

192
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,630
"Not finished"?

193
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,800
Yes, ma'am, I'm certain he said

194
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,330
something about a nerve gas canister.

195
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,230
Did he say anything else?

196
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,330
I'm sorry, Ms. Hayes, that's all I heard.

197
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,860
All right, Davis, stand by.

198
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,460
The medical team will be there in a minute.

199
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,490
Copy that.

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,630
Why would Bierko even mention

201
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,060
- the Sentox?  - I don't know.

202
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,590
I assumed all the canisters were destroyed in the explosions

203
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,000
at the distribution center.

204
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,760
How many canisters has forensics accounted for?

205
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,390
By the time the fires were put out,

206
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,230
there was not enough left to do a full accounting.

207
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,630
Damn it.

208
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,900
Bill, raise an inter-agency alert.

209
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,530
I need LAPD to do a sweep

210
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,860
of the ambush area for witnesses.

211
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,830
I want search helicopters.

212
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,330
I want Chloe to have full domain

213
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,190
over surveillance satellites.

214
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
This is priority one...

215
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,560
we have got to find Vladimir Bierko.

216
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,130
We held one in reserve, just as you ordered...

217
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,490
but I still don't understand why.

218
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,360
We can't do much damage

219
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,160
with one canister of nerve gas.

220
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,730
You're so wrong. Let's go.

221
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,160
E... Excuse me?

222
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,760
Agent...

223
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,830
- It's Agent Cole, ma'am.  - Cole.

224
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,260
I'm sorry, Agent Cole.

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
My husband said that Aaron Pierce

226
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,530
had been transferred to Washington,

227
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,630
and this is Agent Pierce's phone.

228
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,430
I was wondering if you'll be so good

229
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,630
as to make sure that it's returned to him?

230
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,360
Of course.

231
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,800
Was there anything else, ma'am?

232
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,700
No.

233
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
There's nothing else.

234
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,430
Oh, my God.

235
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,260
I'm sorry about this, Aaron.

236
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,200
Listen to me, Aaron.

237
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,830
You think you know what's going on.

238
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,300
I'm here to tell you, you don't.

239
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,530
Then why don't you explain it to me, Mr. President?

240
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,060
I understand Jack Bauer led you to believe

241
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,200
that there was a recording...

242
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:21,000
something that tied me to David Palmer's murder.

243
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,230
That recording doesn't exist.

244
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,330
That's not what I've been told.

245
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,830
You're not hearing what I'm saying.

246
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,960
The recording doesn't exist.

247
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,990
It's over.

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,590
You have a choice here, Aaron.

249
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,560
You are a good man.

250
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,730
You're a fine agent.

251
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,530
I see no reason to throw away your career.

252
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,330
But I need to know that we can put this behind us.

253
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,760
If you'll give me your word that you'll let this drop,

254
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,730
I will make sure that you are reassigned

255
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,800
to whatever post you want.

256
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,900
Except for the White House, of course.

257
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,900
So...

258
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,660
what's it gonna be, Aaron?

259
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,630
Are my terms acceptable?

260
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,590
There is nothing that you have said or done

261
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,630
that is acceptable to me in the least.

262
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,430
You're a traitor to this country and a disgrace to your office.

263
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,730
And it's my duty to see that you're brought to justice

264
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,560
for what you've done.

265
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,490
Is there anything else, Charles?

266
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,030
I know Pierce, Mr. President.

267
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,000
Served with him for five years.

268
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,800
And his loyalty is to David Palmer.

269
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,830
Believe me when I tell you, he's going to be a problem.

270
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,430
Mr. President.

271
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,030
I confess, I didn't expect to hear from you again.

272
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,730
The situation's changed.

273
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,260
Everything's under control.

274
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,130
The recording's been destroyed; it's no longer a problem.

275
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,200
That's very good news, Mr. President.

276
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,930
But what about the people who've already heard it?

277
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Can't do anything without proof.

278
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,860
I don't think any further action needs to be taken.

279
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,760
Then can we assume you've got the rest of your house in order?

280
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,530
If by that you mean my wife, yes.

281
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,930
Yes, she's cooperating fully.

282
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,860
As for Aaron Pierce, that's another matter, but, um...

283
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm taking care of that.

284
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,160
Of course.

285
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,560
What about Jack Bauer?

286
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,100
I've already given Karen Hayes permission to release him,

287
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,960
and the arrangements that we discussed about taking him out

288
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,560
have already been set in motion.

289
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,530
It appears you have everything well in hand,

290
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,730
Mr. President.

291
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,400
Yes, yes. I said I would handle it,

292
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,900
and I have.

293
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,330
Situation's contained, there's nothing more to worry about.

294
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,130
I'll call you back.

295
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,300
Mike?

296
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,940
- Sir.  - What is it, mike?

297
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,710
I just got off the phone with Karen Hayes.

298
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,840
Vladimir Bierko has escaped.

299
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,950
What? How?

300
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,460
The caravan transporting him to district was ambushed.

301
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,610
Damn it! I thought we rolled CTU into homeland security 

302
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,410
just to avoid screwups like this.

303
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,670
There's more, sir.

304
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,710
They have reason to believe Bierko might be readying another terrorist attack.

305
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,170
What kind of attack?

306
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,630
Well, ctu's working on that now.

307
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,460
I want constant updates. You keep me apprised of the progress.

308
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,250
Yes, sir.

309
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,880
Chloe, any luck?

310
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,210
Only the bad kind. None of these satellites were positioned toward the ambush site.

311
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,680
By the time I queued a redirect, Bierko and his men were long gone.

312
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,770
You try caltrans?

313
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,810
I'm back-streaming now. So far, I've come up dry.

314
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,980
Keep trying. We've got to get an ID on the vehicle.

315
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,310
I know.

316
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,840
That was LAPD command. They've combed the area, but they can't find any witnesses.

317
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,490
None?

318
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,760
4:00 A.M. In the middle of a curfew; there simply wasn't anyone there.

319
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,530
Then we have nothing.

320
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,090
- We've got Henderson.  - What about him?

321
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,480
Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas to begin with.

322
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,290
No, we've already been down that road. He won't talk to us, and you know that.

323
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,830
That was about protecting logan. If henderson's the patriot he says he is,

324
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,730
He'll not let terrorists succeed.

325
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,080
Trust me, you're wasting your time. He's not gonna help us.

326
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,460
He will if we offer him a deal.

327
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,820
- That's not gonna happen.  - Jack.

328
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,910
No. Not this time. Not this man.

329
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,060
We're running out of options here. This is about saving lives, not indulging a grudge.

330
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,080
You think this is about a grudge? He killed an ex-president of the united states.

331
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,170
He tried to kill the secretary of defense.

332
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,220
You want this man to walk with full immunity?

333
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,780
It's not about what anyone wants, it's about doing what has to be done.

334
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,820
Nobody knows that better than you.

335
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,950
Bierko is going to kill innocent people. Henderson might be our only chance to stop him.

336
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,270
Jack...

337
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,250
what would David Palmer want you to do if he were here?

338
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:05,050
The best way to honor his memory is to make the choice to save others.

339
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,720
Obviously, I can't stop you from doing this.

340
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,000
If you're gonna give him a deal, at least let me present it.

341
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,860
- All right.  - Thank you.

342
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,370
Since you're clearly no longer a fugitive, I assume they retrieved that recording.

343
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,130
Someone got to it and erased it. I'm not here to talk about the recording.

344
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,800
Bierko escaped about a half an hour ago. He's gonna carry out another attack.

345
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm sure he will. You bruised the man's ego when you stopped his first attempt.

346
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,990
You know him. You know how he thinks. You studied him before you set up this deal.

347
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,500
What's he gonna do?

348
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,910
Why should I help you?

349
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,120
You call yourself a patriot. Prove it.

350
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,790
These terrorists are gonna attack the country that you love, because you betrayed them.

351
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,170
Why don't you help me put out the fire that you started?

352
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,620
They sent you in here to broker a deal, didn't they?

353
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,590
What's the offer, full immunity?

354
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,990
That just must be really eating you up inside.

355
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,810
What do you think?

356
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,190
You were responsible for the murder of people that I cared about.

357
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,230
I am sorry about David Palmer, I am.

358
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,160
But what I did was in the interest of the destiny of this country.

359
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,810
And I'm not talking about the version you read on the op-ed pages pages of the New York Times.

360
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,370
I'm talking about the politics of survival... the way the world really works.

361
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,390
Do you want immunity or not?

362
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,290
Immunity is worthless.

363
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,330
Yeah.

364
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,180
Jack.

365
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,320
That recording was my only immunity.

366
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,720
They give me a piece of paper, I walk out of here, I'm a dead man.

367
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,120
It's two days, two hours, two months, who cares? They're gonna take me down.

368
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,880
Who's they?

369
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,960
Same people that made walt cummings look like a suicide.

370
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,100
Come on, Jack. You can't really believe that Charles Logan masterminded all of this by himself.

371
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,360
Give me the names.

372
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,460
You can't touch them.

373
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,090
But they can touch you.

374
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,460
I'll help you catch Bierko. But not for an immunity deal.

375
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,680
I need something more, and you're the only person can make it happen.

376
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,670
What do you want?

377
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,840
To disappear, just like you did so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese.

378
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,150
Except, I'm not gonna make your mistake.

379
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,130
I'm gonna leave the country, I'm gonna take Miriam with me.

380
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,590
You don't need my help for that.

381
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,120
Actually, I do. All of my contacts are still loyal to the president.

382
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,250
I need somebody I can trust to cover our tracks.

383
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,730
I need somebody who can do a better job of it than those incompetents who failed to cover yours.

384
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,920
What makes you think that I'm not gonna kill you the second this is over?

385
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,570
Because you're gonna give me your word.

386
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,810
And I know what your word is worth to you. So it's all I need.

387
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,190
less that I agree to this

388
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,440
Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate,

389
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,990
this deal is off.

390
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,740
Fine.

391
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,210
Now, Bierko is gonna hit hard,

392
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,880
so you'd better think fast.

393
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,760
Chloe, do a phone check on these 14 names. I want you working out of the situation room.

394
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,880
We are done, What do we have?

395
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,000
Henderson gave us 14 names that he believes Bierko's gonna contact first.

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,460
Chloe's doing a phone check and pulling up relative data.

397
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,760
- Is tactical standing by?  - They're on priority alert.

398
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,030
I put Curtis Manning in command, if it's all right with you.

399
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,240
I trust your judgment, Bill.

400
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Security's getting ready to bring Henderson in here for a debrief.

401
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,180
Excuse me for one second.

402
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,290
Audrey.

403
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,520
Jack, I just heard about the recording. Has it really been destroyed?

404
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,080
- President Logan managed to get to it.  - My god.

405
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,940
We have a more immediate problem.

406
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,480
Bierko. I heard that he escaped. That's why I came back out here.

407
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,170
I was hoping that I could help.

408
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,730
Why is Henderson coming out of Holding?

409
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,060
We're using him to help us find Bierko.

410
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,870
Audrey, Karen made a deal.

411
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,150
She gave him immunity.

412
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,150
What?! Jack, how can you let this happen?

413
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,600
You know what that man has done.

414
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,370
We didn't have a choice.

415
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,650
Bierko's our number one priority.

416
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,220
We know he's planning another attack.

417
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,850
Without Henderson's help, we won't find him.

418
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,890
Jack!

419
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,050
I think we've got something.

420
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,330
Audrey, I'm sorry.

421
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,560
I've got to go.

422
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,260
All right, what we have?

423
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,100
Out of the 14 names on the list,

424
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,530
only one has an active cell phone... Joseph Malina.

425
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,260
Joseph Malina's an arms dealer.

426
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,130
Used to be a military contractor

427
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,760
until they accused him of selling secrets.

428
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,930
But they couldn't prove anything,

429
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,330
so he beat all the charges.

430
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,760
You know him?

431
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,330
Well enough. I did business with him before and after

432
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,000
- he was arrested.  - What do you have on him?

433
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,860
Malina got a 12 second call on his home phone at 4:03 a.m.

434
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,330
from a pay phone in Van Nuys not far from the ambush site.

435
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,800
A minute later, the same pay phone got a call-back

436
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,960
from a GSM Sat phone.

437
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,000
In other words, he took down the number,

438
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,700
called from an untraceable line.

439
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,000
Sounds like our guy.

440
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,400
Tell Curtis to mobilize his tactical team.

441
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,560
Hang on, hang on.

442
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,330
What good is that going to accomplish?

443
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,100
You're going to bring Malina in here.

444
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,830
You think he's just going to roll over on Bierko?

445
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,800
He didn't cut a deal

446
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,800
when he was busted before,

447
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,200
he's not gonna cut a deal now.

448
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,700
And even if you can crack him...

449
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,100
I don't think you can...

450
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
you're going to need hours, and you don't have hours.

451
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,330
What do you suggest?

452
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,260
I suggest you send me in to talk to Malina.

453
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,260
I'll find out what Bierko got from him.

454
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,430
- I don't think so.  - Jack, don't be stupid.

455
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,590
You know you can't get anything out of this guy,

456
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,900
and his computer makes this place

457
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,700
look like an Internet cafe.

458
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,300
He's got the absolute, most sophisticated,

459
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,000
state-of-the-art security system,

460
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,960
including a Phoenix Shield.

461
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,160
We can get through it.

462
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,260
Not a Phoenix. It's a poison pill firewall.

463
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,700
Any attempt at circumventing it,

464
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,100
and the hard drive does a cold-start erase,

465
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,230
at which point, you can forget about retrieving any data.

466
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,430
Take him back to Holding.

467
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,100
I don't think. we have a choice here.

468
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,300
Karen, please, don't do this.

469
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,230
Jack, I know. how you feel,

470
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,430
but Henderson's right.

471
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,490
We can't afford to gamble on this play.

472
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,490
Damn it, Bill, you cannot trust this guy.

473
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,930
I agree.

474
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,490
That's why I'm sending you with him.

475
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,730
I want him under your guard on a tight leash.

476
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,760
If he tries anything, I swear to you,

477
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,100
I will kill him.

478
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,530
Then don't let it get to that point.

479
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,800
Get in.

480
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,530
Adams, listen to me.

481
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,030
You don't have to do this.

482
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,460
Logan isn't worth protecting.

483
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,860
You know that.

484
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,200
He's not going to get away

485
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,700
with any of this, and neither will you.

486
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,300
Shut up and get in the trunk.

487
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,660
Use your head. Logan wants me

488
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,660
dead because he thinks I know too much,

489
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,930
that I'm a liability.

490
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,300
How soon before you're just another liability?

491
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,400
What are you doing?

492
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,930
Ma'am please stay where you are.

493
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,960
Aaron?

494
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,260
You're going to shoot me?

495
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,930
I'm the First Lady.

496
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,800
You're going to shoot the First Lady?

497
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,930
Who are you calling?

498
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,560
Mrs. Logan, this is my last warning.

499
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,630
Martha.

500
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,800
Aaron!

501
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,930
Aaron, stay with me.

502
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,030
Aaron! Oh, God.

503
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,900
Oh, God, Aaron.

504
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,000
Jack, we're coming up on Malina's place.

505
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,060
Curtis, I want you to set up a perimeter.

506
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,200
I want a man at each possible escape route.

507
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,260
You got it. As for you, you got ten minutes.

508
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,860
You don't get the intelligence from Malina by then,

509
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,700
we come through the door, and we interrogate him.

510
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,630
I'm gonna tell you again, Jack, interrogating won't work.

511
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,860
- This guy won't break.  - Then you better hope your way does.

512
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,960
Get me an audio pack. Undo your shirt.

513
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,700
Wait a minute. You can't wire me.

514
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,690
- Why not?  - Well, think about it, Jack.

515
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,900
You heard Malina's file.

516
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,630
This guy didn't get where he got by being careless.

517
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,130
He's got a scanner, frequency detector, God knows what else.

518
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,160
The second I walk through that door with a wire,

519
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,860
the bells go off, this thing's over.

520
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,900
Look, you don't trust me, fine.

521
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,260
And just so we're straight, I don't trust you, either,

522
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,900
but neither one of us can afford to blow this operation.

523
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,560
We're all set. Men are in position.

524
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,460
No games, Christopher.

525
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,920
I don't need another reason to put a bullet in your brain.

526
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,030
You got ten minutes.

527
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,230
Have CTU in-monitor channel 8.

528
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,530
Hold up.

529
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,900
Go.

530
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,460
Who is it?

531
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,460
What do you want, Chris?

532
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,760
We have to talk.

533
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,600
What, at 4:30 in the morning?

534
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,900
About Vladimir Bierko.

535
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,800
You don't waste my time, I don't waste your time.

536
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,460
You're going to want to hear what I have to say.

537
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,200
Hey!

538
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,860
What's so important it couldn't wait?

539
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
What are you looking for?

540
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,400
Is there another way out of here?

541
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,600
What the hell are you talking about?

542
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,900
Jack, I don't like this.

543
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
What's Henderson doing?

544
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,760
I don't yet. Maintain your position.

545
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,600
I repeat, maintain your position.

546
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,460
Secure-cache the files.

547
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,700
Anything you can't do without.

548
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Why?

549
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,500
Because there is an entire phalanx

550
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,360
of CTU agents outside,

551
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,530
including an ex-agent named Jack Bauer.

552
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,230
He's selling us out, Jack.

553
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,500
Now, Bauer is running me.

554
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,400
I cut a deal with him, but I know

555
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,260
this guy's gonna kill me first chance he gets.

556
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,700
Curtis, move your team in now.

557
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,360
All teams, move in now!

558
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,060
You bastard, you brought him here!

559
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,730
He was coming here anyway.

560
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,430
So secure the files, crash the system.

561
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,560
Stop wasting time, and do it!

562
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,530
Give me a weapon.

563
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,160
Freeze! 

564
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,060
Christopher!

565
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,730
Let me see your hands! Now!

566
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,160
Slowly stand up.

567
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,360
Put the weapon on the counter.

568
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,160
Step back.

569
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,400
Curtis, how are your men?

570
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,860
My men are fine.

571
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,430
I've been hit, but I'm okay.

572
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,360
Call in medical; get him transferred back to CTU.

573
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,660
What's Malina's condition?

574
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,700
Gunshot to the hip.

575
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,660
He's losing blood.

576
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,500
Stabilize him, keep him alive.

577
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,530
I had him, Jack.

578
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,100
30 more seconds was all I needed.

579
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
You played me.

580
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,700
This is over; you're going back.

581
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,200
No, you blew it, Jack.

582
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,760
What are you talking about?

583
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,460
I got him to life the firewall, and he was about to dump

584
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,100
all of his files onto a flash drive

585
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,100
before you jumped the gun and busted in here.

586
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,130
Now you're going to waste a hell of a lot of time

587
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,700
trying to decrypt those files off a mainframe,

588
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,730
so you'd better pray there's something on there you can read.

589
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,560
Cuff him.

590
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,300
Bill, this is Jack.

591
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,900
Get Chloe to open up a channel.

592
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,300
I'm going to send you some files from Malina's computer.

593
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm on it, Jack.

594
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,430
Chloe, I need you to access these files,

595
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,160
find out which ones were opened in the last ten minutes.

596
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,360
They'll tell us what Malina sold Bierko.

597
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,660
They're coming through now... hang on.

598
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,860
Bill, Curtis was hit... he's stable,

599
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,530
but I'm having him transported back to CTU.

600
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,000
All right, Jack, I'll tell Medical.

601
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,700
Send a chopper over to this location.

602
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,500
As soon as we know what Bierko's target is,

603
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,900
we're going to need to move fast.

604
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,560
Okay, I got through the firewall.

605
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,400
It's still going to take me some time to decrypt the files.

606
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,300
Chloe, just do it as quickly as you can.

607
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,930
Bierko's going to release the Sentox gas soon.

608
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,430
We need to know where.

609
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,830
There, you should have everything.

610
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,930
Let's go.

611
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,960
Aaron?

612
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,000
Charles lied to me.

613
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,860
He said you'd been transferred to Washington.

614
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,330
That agent, um...

615
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Adams,

616
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,260
my husband ordered him to kill you, didn't he?

617
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,730
Yes, ma'am.

618
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,360
But I'm sorry to tell you...

619
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,230
the president was involved with much worse things than that.

620
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,760
I know.

621
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:28,530
I was going to let him get away with it... all of it.

622
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,430
I was going to keep quiet.

623
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,530
We have to do something.

624
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,860
I'll hide the body, get him in the trunk,

625
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,630
but I can't drive it out of here.

626
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,430
The president has to believe that I'm dead.

627
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,700
I need to lay low, keep out of sight.

628
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,930
I can do it.

629
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,960
- No. No.  - Yes, Aaron, I can drive it.

630
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,430
No, you need to get back inside the residence.

631
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,600
Your husband can't suspect that anything has gone wrong.

632
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,360
You need to find Mike Novick.

633
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,430
Mike?

634
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,030
Tell him everything.

635
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,230
And tell him to meet me here.

636
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,260
Okay.

637
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:19,360
Aaron, promise me...

638
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,830
promise me that if something goes wrong

639
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,300
and you're in danger of getting caught,

640
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
you will find a way off these grounds,

641
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,860
and you will leave.

642
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,700
Promise me.

643
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,160
You have my word.

644
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,860
Secure him by the tailgate.

645
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,430
Buchanan.

646
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,460
Bill, it's Jack.

647
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,600
How is Chloe doing with the files?

648
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,000
Almost there, Jack.

649
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,360
Okay, I got it.

650
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,630
Wait, there's something more.

651
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,630
Classified defense contracts and plans.

652
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,800
It's a Russian submarine, Jack.

653
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,260
The Natalia-K524, Delta-IV class.

654
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,260
It's here for inspection by our navy.

655
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,960
Why is the U.S. Navy inspecting a Russian submarine?

656
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,400
It's part of the treaty that President Logan

657
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,960
and President Suvarov signed.

658
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,100
There's a provision that calls for the sharing of technology.

659
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,500
Where is it docked?

660
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,030
Docking Station 8.

661
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,230
It's a non-military shipyard at the Port of Los Angeles.

662
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,660
I'll deploy TAC teams to the port.

663
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,830
Good.

664
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,060
Chloe, hold on.

665
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,900
What's the armament package on a Russian Delta IV-class sub?

666
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,100
Best of my knowledge, 12 Scorpion land attack missiles.

667
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,300
Are they nuclear?

668
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,760
No, but they're fast and accurate.

669
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,060
They carry multiple warheads.

670
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,960
One could take out several city blocks.

671
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Uncuff him.

672
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,100
Karen, it's Jack.

673
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,260
Are you still there?

674
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,300
Yes, Jack, I'm here.

675
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,030
Okay, I need you to put me in touch

676
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,460
with the ranking U.S. officeron the Natalia.

677
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,330
We need to get them to lock out their onboard weapons systems!

678
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,430
All right, I'll have Audrey call DOD

679
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,260
and open a priority line to the sub,

680
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,360
and she'll get back to you.

681
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,160
Okay, thank you.

682
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,530
You're coming with me.

683
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,500
I found Bierko's target for you.

684
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,430
The deal was Bierko's head on a plate.

685
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,800
What do you want me to do now... kill him for you?!

686
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,160
The only reason you're going with me

687
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,500
is 'cause you know the weapons systems.

688
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,500
Get in!

689
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,300
Let's go!

690
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,800
This is Bauer.

691
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,760
Jack, I've got the U.S. Navy's ranking officer

692
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,460
on board the Natalia... I'm putting you through.

693
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,460
Okay, Audrey, stay on the line.

694
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,660
All right, Jack, hold on.

695
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,100
Lieutenant Southern, you're on with Jack Bauer.

696
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,960
Agent Bauer, what is this about?

697
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,160
Lieutenant, we believe the Natalia

698
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,160
has been targeted for a terrorist attack.

699
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,830
You need to secure your vessel

700
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,500
and lock down your weapons systems immediately.

701
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,630
Ski!

702
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,260
Call all hands, set Condition Delta,

703
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,600
seal the bridge and aft hatches.

704
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,660
- Aye, sir.  - You need to put your men on alert.

705
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,960
There's a threat to your submarine.

706
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,430
Now, what is the nature of this threat?

707
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,530
We think the terrorists are after your missiles on the sub.

708
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,460
I'm going to check right now.

709
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,660
Sailor! I've got that.

710
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,960
Report aft.

711
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,930
Bauer.

712
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
I'm checking topside.

713
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,830
Lieutenant!

714
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,060
Damn it, Audrey, I've lost him.

715
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,160
Notify DOD.

716
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,360
All right, Jack, I'm on it.

717
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,460
Captain, we need to move.

718
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,600
Captain, how far out are we?

719
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,060
Just over five minutes, sir.

720
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,860
Read me the code we got from Malina.

721
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,630
"Alpha 255

722
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,130
Tango Romeo 99."

723
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,500
We have control of the weapons system.

724
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,530
Are the missiles loaded?

725
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,330
Vertical tubes are loaded and ready.

726
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,200
Loading horizontal tubes now.

727
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


728
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,470
You're a traitor to this country and a disgrace to your office.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,200
Logan wants me dead because he thinks I know too much.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,740
Logan had more to protect, and you know that.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,280
- Aaron?  - Ma'am, please stay where you are.

5
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,810
- Bierko's escaped.  - What?

6
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,190
How long ago?

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,660
Davis, Karen Hayes here. What happened?

8
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,940
Our lead car got taken out by an IED.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,710
I overheard Bierko talking to his men. 

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,040
He said they're not finished.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,750
I'm sure he said something about a nerve gas canister.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,540
Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas to begin with.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,700
Trust me. You're wasting your time. He's not going to help us.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,700
He will if we offer him a deal.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,530
What do you want?

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,100
I'll disappear just like you did so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,470
Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate, 

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,800
this deal is off.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,600
Bierko's going to release the Sentox gas soon. We need to know where.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,020
It's a Russian submarine, Jack.

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,940
What is the armament package on a Russian Delta-4 class sub?

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,650
Best of my knowledge, 12 Scorpion land-attack missiles.

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,860
They're fast and accurate, carry multiple warheads. 

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,790
One of them can take out several city blocks.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,300
Lieutenant, we believe the Natalia has been targeted for a terrorist attack.

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,870
We think the terrorists are after your missiles on the sub.

27
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,310
You need to secure your vessel 

28
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,460
and lock down your weapons system immediately.

29
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,600
That way.

30
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,290
We have control of the weapons system.

31
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,600
I've flushed the Sentox. The atmospheric readings are all normal.

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,370
It's safe to breathe.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,580
The coordinates for the targets... upload them into the missiles.

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,880
Begin the launch countdown.

35
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,990
Remove your masks.

36
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,080
We are close to finishing what we started today.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,530
I have identified 12 high-value targets:

38
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,020
financial centers, transportation hubs, 

39
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,550
high-population-density areas.

40
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,100
The Americans will wake up this morning to discover

41
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,230
how steep a price they've paid for their alliance with Moscow.

42
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,720
What we're about to accomplish today

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,060
will be remembered by our countrymen forever.

44
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,410
- Ms. Raines.  - Admiral Kirkland.

45
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,000
I understand you're reporting some type of 

46
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,130
emergency at the Port of Los Angeles?

47
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,470
In anticipation of today's treaty with the Russians, 

48
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,140
the Russian submarine Natalia is docked here for inspection by the U.S. Navy.

49
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,850
I'm familiar with the exercise. I authorized it myself.

50
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,920
Terrorists have seized control of that submarine.

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,150
What? We haven't received any distress signals from the crew.

52
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,570
Because they're dead, sir, all of them, including the Russian crew.

53
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,030
We believe the terrorists have flooded 

54
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,870
the sub's ventilation system with Sentox nerve gas.

55
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,640
My God.

56
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,220
Sir, I don't mean to preempt your protocols, 

57
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,320
but how long will it take you to scramble a flight of F-18s?

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,180
You're asking me to sink the submarine?

59
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,580
Sir, these terrorists are in control of 12 multiple-warhead missiles, 

60
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,350
which they will use against civilian targets 

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,650
unless we stop them first.

62
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,630
I'll need all of this confirmed.

63
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,560
We have a team on the ground that can confirm, 

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,930
but now I need to know precisely:

65
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,210
How long will it take for you to scramble these fighters?

66
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,790
I'm sending you the estimated approach vectors and ETA for my F-18s.

67
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,230
I can have my fighter jets there within 22 to 25 minutes.

68
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,520
We have a problem, sir.

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,930
According to our simulation, 

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,120
Bierko will have his missiles in the air in less than 20 minutes.

71
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,880
Scrambling the jets right now, but it seems to me 

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,190
as if this is going to be up to your team on the ground.

73
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,350
We have visual contact with the sub.

74
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,580
Hatches are still closed. Ship's been locked down.

75
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,440
Confirming one hostile topside, standing guard.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,480
Jack, Chloe's simulation has Bierko firing those missiles in less than 20 minutes.

77
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,570
Sooner than that if he's already started programming targets.

78
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,000
The Navy won't be able to intercept in time.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,930
Jack, it's Audrey. I just got off the phone with Admiral Kirkland.

80
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,950
He's scrambling F-18s, but they won't be able to 

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,270
get them in the air in time in order to destroy the sub.

82
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,870
- How far out are reinforcements?  - Too far.

83
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,840
Additional tac teams won't arrive until after the missiles have launched.

84
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,070
That means we have to take Bierko down ourselves.

85
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,480
That's not a real option, Jack. 

86
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,750
There are only four entry points on that submarine.

87
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,850
We have to assume that Bierko's locked them down and is defending them.

88
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,860
Jack, Bill's right.

89
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,250
We don't have the manpower or the resources to get on that sub.

90
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,540
We might. Somebody just launched a signal tube off the starboard side.

91
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,950
What's a signal tube?

92
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,170
It's a radio beacon crewmen 

93
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,240
can send to the surface in case of emergencies.

94
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,380
Chloe, if there are friendlies inside, they can help us board the sub.

95
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,110
- I want you to scan all emergency frequencies.  - On it.

96
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,420
Standing by.

97
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,680
Jack, just so we're straight... 

98
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,920
we stop Bierko, my wife and I disappear for good, with your help, right?

99
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,220
- Yeah.  - One other thing.

100
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,000
If I'm going on that sub with you, I need a firearm.

101
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll cover you.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,810
Well, that's what I'm worried about.

103
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,250
I don't go anywhere undefended against hostiles.

104
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,940
I still consider you a hostile.

105
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,110
Jack, I don't get a gun, I don't go in.

106
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,000
Jack, you were right. There's a survivor on the submarine. 

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,720
He's sending out a distress signal.

108
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,650
- Can he receive on this frequency?  - Yeah.

109
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,480
Patch him through.

110
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,670
I repeat. Petty Officer Tim Rooney, on Natalia K524.

111
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,470
Code seven. SOS. We are under attack.

112
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,620
Petty Officer Rooney, my name is Jack Bauer.

113
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,110
I'm with the Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.

114
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,800
What the hell is going on, sir? Everyone's dead.

115
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,080
And there are people in the Control Room trying to operate the missile launch system.

116
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,230
- Who the hell are they?  - They're Russian separatists.

117
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,470
They're the terrorists that were responsible for 

118
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,290
the attacks that took place earlier today.

119
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,730
Does the Navy know about this?

120
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,480
Yeah. They're sending in fighters, 

121
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,840
but I don't think they're going to get here in time.

122
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,600
So what are we supposed to do?

123
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,610
Did anyone else from your crew survive the attack?

124
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,760
No. I don't think so.

125
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,270
Where are you?

126
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,410
Lower Level, Auxiliary Engineering. 

127
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,360
I was down here doing an inventory when the alarms went off.

128
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,470
The atmospheric gauges red-lined. 

129
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,840
It's a sealed compartment, so I shut it down.

130
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,060
The men that attacked the ship, were they wearing gas masks?

131
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,540
They were, but they took them off a few minutes ago.

132
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,630
Okay, good. That means they flushed the Sentox out of the air system.

133
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,930
You should be able to move around freely. Hold on one second.

134
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,510
- Chloe?  - Yes, Jack?

135
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,340
I want you to get me the nearest entry point 

136
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,290
to Petty Officer Rooney's current position.

137
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,050
The closest hatch is the forward escape hatch.

138
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,390
Copy that.

139
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,280
Petty Officer Rooney, do you have a firearm?

140
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,120
No. The armory's on the other side of the ship.

141
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,670
You need to find something that you can use as a weapon.

142
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,400
I have a... I have a utility tool. It has a knife on it.

143
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,980
That'll work. I want you to make your way up to the Upper Level. 

144
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,220
Let me know when you get there.

145
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,660
You still haven't told me what it is you want me to do.

146
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,780
I need you to get to the forward escape hatch and let us in.

147
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,140
There's a man there guarding it.

148
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,760
Then you're going to have to kill him.

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Petty Officer Rooney?

150
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,050
I'm an engineer.

151
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,510
I... I'm not trained for that.

152
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,090
The men that commandeered the Natalia plan to 

153
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,360
use its missiles and launch them on civilian targets 

154
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,380
unless we stop them.

155
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,550
You need to make your way up to the Upper Level. 

156
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,770
You need to do it now. We are running out of time.

157
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,750
- I'll contact you when I get there.  - Copy that.

158
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,670
We need to get closer to the sub. Are you ready?

159
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,410
Jack, I know you got Malina's .45 in that bag. Now, give it to me.

160
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Let's go.

161
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,820
We're generating a list of potential targets, 

162
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,220
but frankly, we have no idea what Bierko plans to hit.

163
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,200
Are we evacuating these potential targets?

164
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,030
Don't have time. The missiles will strike before we can 

165
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,520
mobilize even small numbers of people to the safe zones.

166
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,400
How could this happen, Mike?

167
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,510
How could these people even access a submarine in the first place?

168
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,360
The sub was attacked when it was being serviced at a civilian port, 

169
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,360
not on a Naval base where security would have been more substantial.

170
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,180
There has to be a way to destroy that sub 

171
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,200
before Bierko can launch those missiles.

172
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,010
F-18s are scrambling as we speak.

173
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,200
According to the latest estimates, 

174
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,860
they're not going to get there in time.

175
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,290
Yes?

176
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,610
I'm still waiting to talk to Mike Novick.

177
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,800
He's in some kind of crisis meeting. 

178
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
There's no telling how long he'll be.

179
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,570
Then I should try to get off the ranch on my own.

180
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,030
No. Without Mike's help, you'll be seen. 

181
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,570
Charles can't find out you're still alive.

182
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,830
- I'll call you as soon as I get ahold of Mike.  - Okay.

183
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,020
Jack, the missiles will launch in less than ten minutes.

184
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,160
Copy that.

185
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,600
How much time do you need to cancel the launch sequence?

186
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,950
I won't know for certain until I see how the targeting software is configured.

187
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,500
Jack, the Petty Officer is coming back on.

188
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,630
Patch him through.

189
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,150
Petty Officer Rooney, you're on with Jack Bauer.

190
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,010
What's your position, son?

191
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,380
I'm 30 feet forward of the hatch.

192
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,130
Have you got a visual of the hostile guarding the hatch?

193
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,580
Yeah. He's still there.

194
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,620
What do you want me to do?

195
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,320
You need to kill him without alerting the others.

196
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,040
Are you right-handed or left-handed?

197
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,670
- I'm right-handed.  - I want you to approach him from behind.

198
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,980
When you're within 18 inches, 

199
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,450
I want you to take your left hand, put it on his mouth, 

200
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,740
pull his head back into your chest exposing his neck.

201
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,210
Then I want you to take your right hand and slit his throat.

202
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,210
- My God.  - You need to cut deep to sever the vocal cords and the carotid artery.

203
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,800
I... I don't, uh... I don't know if I can do this.

204
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,030
You don't have a choice, son.

205
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,030
You need to focus on the objective.

206
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,750
You cannot afford to think about this, son. You need to do it.

207
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,890
Jack, there's less than nine minutes until the missiles' launch.

208
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,200
Petty Officer Rooney?

209
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,970
Petty Officer Rooney?

210
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,490
Okay, I can do this.

211
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,320
I have to do this.

212
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,180
Cut him deep, and cut him fast.

213
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,040
Agent McCullough, cover us. We're moving in on the tower.

214
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,620
- Yes. Sir.  - Go.

215
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,130
Petty Officer Rooney, what is your status?

216
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,870
My status is, uh... He's dead.

217
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,970
Did anyone hear you?

218
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,640
- No, no one's coming.  - Good. Open the hatch.

219
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,190
- You ready?  - Yeah.

220
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,100
I'll take out the guard. Let's go.

221
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,310
The guard is dead. We are going in.

222
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,080
Oh, no. The sub's missile hatches just opened.

223
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,200
I see them. What does that mean in terms of our time frame?

224
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,360
You have less than seven minutes until they launch.

225
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,510
- Are you all right?  - I'm okay.

226
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,460
- Which way is the control room?  - It's down that hall.

227
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,490
- You lead, we'll follow.  - Okay.

228
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,840
All right, the control room's right down that hall.

229
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm going to need your help drawing the rest of the hostiles out of the con.

230
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,400
What do you want me to do?

231
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,200
Is there another way for you to get to the other side of the control room?

232
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,170
Yeah, I can go down one level and then come up behind them.

233
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,420
Okay, when you get there, 

234
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,780
I want you to create a diversion, something loud.

235
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,150
Just make sure you get them out of there.

236
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,840
When you do, I want you to find somewhere to lay low and stay there.

237
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,160
I do not want you to engage them.

238
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,000
- Do you understand me?  - Yeah, I can do that.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,890
Go.

240
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,450
With the last three missiles, 

241
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,340
make sure you overlap these populations centers in San Francisco.

242
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,220
Locking up GPS coordinates, sir.

243
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,520
Keep working.

244
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,350
- Did you hear that?  - Yes, sir. Down there.

245
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,310
Come with me, both of you.

246
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,230
The control room's right behind us.

247
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,080
I have a visual on one hostile.

248
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,730
Agent McCullough, I'm going to move into position.

249
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,030
When he's directly above me, signaling me with the mirror.

250
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,290
Jack, the missiles are armed. Three minutes to launch.

251
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,710
We're clear.

252
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,120
Jack, I'm gonna have to manually reverse all these codes.

253
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,300
Do you have enough time?

254
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,390
I'll do my best. I don't want to be in here any more than you 

255
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,320
if those F-18s take out this sub.

256
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,860
We're going to keep Bierko and his men out of here so you can finish this.

257
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,760
Let's go.

258
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,810
Agent McCullough's down.

259
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,060
Bierko and one hostile remaining. Henderson, what is your status?

260
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,590
Jack, I need more time. You've got to hold them off.

261
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,380
60 seconds until they launch.

262
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,180
Jack?

263
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,260
Hang on, Jack.

264
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
It's almost there, Jack.

265
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,700
Four more seconds.

266
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,380
Ten seconds.

267
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,630
It's done.

268
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,060
The launch sequence is canceled.

269
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,780
I repeat, the launch sequence is canceled.

270
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,500
- Audrey, recall the F-18's.  - I'm on it.

271
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,070
Bierko's dead. The submarine is secure.

272
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,570
- Jack, are you okay?  - Bill, I'm fine.

273
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,290
I'm getting a lot of feedback. Take me off the com.

274
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,840
Okay, Jack.

275
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,300
Hold it, Jack.

276
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,840
Now lower your arms real slow

277
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,220
and turn around.

278
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,280
You were never really going to let me go, were you?

279
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,870
No.

280
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,900
Good for you, Jack.

281
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,210
You were responsible for the deaths of David Palmer, 

282
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,030
Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler.

283
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,470
They were friends of mine.

284
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,240
That's the way it works.

285
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,910
Put your hands above the head.

286
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,860
Identify yourself!

287
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,540
My name is Jack Bauer, 

288
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,610
with the Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles!

289
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,820
All the hostiles are dead!

290
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,220
Holster your weapons!

291
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,630
Sir, you need to contact Bill Buchanan immediately.

292
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,750
Okay. Lieutenant, I need access to a vehicle.

293
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,060
Petty Officer, get me a vehicle now!

294
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,850
Thank you.

295
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,730
- Jack?  - Yeah.

296
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,270
I've been told the Navy's running clean up and security on the sub.

297
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,690
Yeah, they're here now.

298
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,750
Bill, Christopher Henderson is dead.

299
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,000
What? What happened?

300
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,020
He fired on me. I didn't have a choice.

301
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,850
Are you coming back to CTU?

302
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,190
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

303
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,970
All right, we'll see you then.

304
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,030
Chloe, the Navy needs our access codes to our logs

305
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,320
so they can use them for their report. Can you pick up?

306
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,770
Yeah.

307
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,290
What codes do they need?

308
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,070
They don't. Get somewhere where you won't be overheard.

309
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,300
I'll have to get that from my screen.

310
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,300
Let me get back to my station.

311
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,860
I'm here.

312
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,810
What's going on?

313
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,390
I'm not coming back to CTU. I'm going after Logan.

314
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,370
What do you mean, going after Logan?

315
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,030
I'll fill you in on the details later.

316
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,270
Right now I need you to walk me through 

317
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,530
modifying some field communications equipment.

318
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,990
That's not exactly my area, Jack.

319
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,160
Then you'll need to get some help.

320
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,000
Chloe, are you with me on this?

321
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,640
Yeah. What do you need?

322
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,740
Hold on, I'll give you a list.

323
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,080
Okay.

324
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,110
We're certain the missiles no longer pose a threat?

325
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,550
Yes, Mr. President.

326
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,840
We have complete control over the boat.

327
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,170
Vladimir Bierko and all his known associates are dead

328
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,160
or in custody.

329
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,640
So then it's all over, Mike.

330
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,520
It's over.

331
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,440
I need to make a statement before I go back to Washington.

332
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,830
About the successful resolution of the crisis.

333
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,120
Yes.

334
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,530
And about David Palmer.

335
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,860
Sir?

336
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,520
David's casket is being flown to Arlington for burial, 

337
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,410
and I would like to say a few words alongside it at the airfield, 

338
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,470
and then I'll fly back to Washington.

339
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,730
I'll get to work on it right away.

340
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,940
Good. Thank you, Mike.

341
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,860
For everything.

342
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,680
It's been a hell of a day.

343
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,790
Yes, sir.

344
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,940
It has.

345
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,420
Mike.

346
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,190
You need to come with me.

347
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,480
Come with you?

348
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,750
Please.

349
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,590
Oh, please.

350
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,110
- Mrs. Logan, have you been...?  - No.

351
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,650
I've never been more sober.

352
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,210
Or more sane.

353
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,630
What's this about?

354
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,020
My husband.

355
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,100
What about him?

356
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,360
Mike, I know you've been troubled by Charles's actions today.

357
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,010
You know that something is terribly, terribly wrong.

358
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,810
You just can't put your finger on it.

359
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,340
Okay.

360
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,590
Tell me what this is about.

361
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,210
No, I'm going to show you.

362
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,290
It'll explain everything. Please come.

363
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,850
The mission to retake the submarine has been successful.

364
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,720
Hmm, so I understand.

365
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,110
You'll also be interested to know,

366
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,150
Christopher Henderson was killed during the operation.

367
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,180
You're certain of this?

368
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,320
CTU has confirmed the information.

369
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,280
That's excellent.

370
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,050
But let's not fool ourselves into thinking that's the end of all our problems.

371
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,290
There's still Bauer to deal with.

372
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,020
Don't worry.

373
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,590
Mr. Bauer will be taken care of.

374
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,200
Good.

375
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,820
Mike. Over here.

376
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,290
Aaron...

377
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,370
What happened to you?

378
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,240
Agent Adams tried to kill me.

379
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,030
On the president's orders.

380
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,070
That doesn't make any sense.

381
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,440
Where is Agent Adams?

382
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,590
Mike, we need your help.

383
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,130
My God.

384
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,960
What the hell's going on here?

385
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,480
The president had something to do with this?

386
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,960
Everything.

387
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,310
He was involved with everything that happened today... 

388
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,510
supplying the terrorists with the nerve gas, 

389
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,900
the murder of David Palmer.

390
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,390
But Walt Cummings?

391
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,280
Walt was just their scapegoat.

392
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,370
He didn't commit suicide.

393
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,220
He was murdered by a man who works for Charles.

394
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,340
Charles told me to be quiet.

395
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,880
For the good of the country.

396
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,590
Keep my mouth shut.

397
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,150
I can't do that. Not anymore.

398
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,680
Do you have proof?

399
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,630
Jack Bauer was in possession of a recording that implicated the president.

400
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,360
That's why Logan was willing

401
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,530
to go so far as to shoot a plane full of people down...

402
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,830
because Jack was on it.

403
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,970
Well, where is this recording?

404
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,150
It's been destroyed.

405
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,270
I didn't want to believe it either, Mike, 

406
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,800
but it's the truth, so help me God.

407
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,780
All right.

408
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,230
If this is true, we need to find another way

409
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,500
to make a case against the president.

410
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,620
You're right, but first we have to get Aaron off the ranch.

411
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,350
There can't be a record of it.

412
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,870
All right. You're right.

413
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,230
We need to move fast.

414
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,120
I know the men at the Western Gate well.

415
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,200
They won't stop and inspect the vehicle if I'm driving.

416
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,010
You'll hide in the back out of sight.

417
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,160
Thank you, Mike.

418
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,730
Give me the keys.

419
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,200
Aaron.

420
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,930
I'll be fine.

421
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,480
I'll go somewhere where your husband's people can't find me.

422
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,070
But will you let me know that you're all right?

423
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,680
It's probably safer if we don't have any contact.

424
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,650
Good bye, Aaron.

425
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,950
Thank you.

426
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,680
Mike Novick.

427
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,240
Mike, it's Jack Bauer.

428
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,380
I know this is an unusual request, but I'm looking for Aaron Pierce.

429
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,890
I've been trying to reach him on his cell, but he's not answering.

430
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,530
It's Jack Bauer. He's trying to find you.

431
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,240
Can you put him on speaker?

432
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,810
Aaron's with me right now, Jack. Hold on.

433
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,530
It's all right, Jack. You can speak freely in front of Mike.

434
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,920
He knows what I know.

435
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,140
Aaron, where are you?

436
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,550
A few miles from the ranch.

437
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,800
What happened?

438
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,330
The president tried to have me killed, 

439
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,460
but Mrs. Logan saved my life.

440
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,790
She and I both decided to bring Mike into this.

441
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,840
And I'm still trying to process everything they told me.

442
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,020
This is a real mess, Jack.

443
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,170
Mike, I'm calling Aaron because I need his help. I need yours, too.

444
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,590
Help with what?

445
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,470
Bringing President Logan to justice.

446
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,530
Well, Aaron said the recording you had

447
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,120
implicating the president was destroyed. Is that true?

448
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,070
Yes.

449
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,820
Well, without it you can't mount a case.

450
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,440
I can if I can get a direct confession from Logan.

451
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,410
I'm working with someone inside CTU.

452
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,930
They're setting up a digital uplink.

453
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,240
If I can get Logan to acknowledge everything that he's done today, 

454
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,040
it's going to be all the evidence we need.

455
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,650
Jack, if you intend to physically coerce the president of the United States...

456
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,390
Mike, we need to do this now.

457
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,490
The longer we wait, the more vulnerable we are.

458
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,870
President Logan tried to take me out, just like he did Aaron.

459
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,120
I don't need to remind you that he was responsible for David Palmer's assassination

460
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,560
and a terrorist attack on this country's soil.

461
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,020
He cannot be allowed to remain in office, not for one more day.

462
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,610
How long will it take you to get here?

463
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,750
20 minutes.

464
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,710
That's too late. President Logan will be gone.

465
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,860
He's leaving for Washington around that time.

466
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,500
Then you have to try and delay him.

467
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,790
I'm not sure I can do that.

468
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,820
Mike, just tell me you'll try.

469
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,570
All right.

470
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,590
But get here as fast as you can.

471
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,220
Okay. Thank you.

472
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,870
Yes, sir. I'll get on a plane as soon 

473
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,130
as I finish our debrief with the Navy.

474
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,940
Homeland's ordered me to Washington as soon as I file the Bierko case.

475
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,320
Apparently, the request came from the White House.

476
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,030
Logan's looking for an excuse to clean house.

477
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,320
I'm sure I'll be next.

478
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,160
Come in.

479
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,300
Yes, Chloe. Do you have something?

480
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,820
I need an authorization code.

481
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,590
For what?

482
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,790
I need access to a high-clearance workstation.

483
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,280
You already have access.

484
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,690
It's for some new personnel.

485
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,900
What?

486
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,160
Morris?

487
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,190
You're bringing Morris back?

488
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,200
Yes.

489
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,540
Why, Chloe?

490
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,880
Because I'm still trying to salvage something from the recording that Miles erased.

491
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,580
If anyone can do it, it's Morris.

492
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,640
I didn't think Morris was even on the government payroll anymore.

493
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,760
He's not.

494
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,080
What's he doing?

495
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,360
He's selling women's shoes in Beverly Hills.

496
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,020
What?

497
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,090
Is this a joke?

498
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,840
No. You know I wouldn't have brought him in 

499
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,300
if there was anyone else I could call.

500
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,350
Please, Mr. Buchanan.

501
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,910
Thank you.

502
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,370
Bill...

503
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,540
- It's going to be all right.  - Who is this guy?

504
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,480
Morris O'Brian.

505
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,180
Chloe's ex-husband.

506
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,550
No, no, not like that. May I?

507
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,870
See, the beauty of the beast is if you leave these fields blank, 

508
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,750
it'll prompt you for a code. Ba-bing. See that?

509
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,200
You just saved 60 seconds.

510
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,190
Ten of those a day, that's an extra cigarette break

511
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,650
or whatever it is you do to take the edge off.

512
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
Morris.

513
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,200
What are you doing?

514
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,990
Just making your people more efficient.

515
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,040
I noticed you picked the most attractive one.

516
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,940
Wrong. You're the most attractive one.

517
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,810
Here's your clearance.

518
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,610
I'm surprised you got Bill Buchanan to sign off on me.

519
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,050
You know, this is a really good opportunity for you.

520
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,990
Why don't you surprise me and not totally screw it up?

521
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,540
Okay. I'm going to pretend that this will require all my focus and attention, 

522
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,920
even though we both know I can do it in my sleep.

523
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,280
Sit down.

524
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,240
So where is this recording you want me to resurrect?

525
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,100
Nothing. Forget it. It's fried.

526
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,880
I'm missing something.

527
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,980
You said you wanted me to salvage a digital recording.

528
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,470
That was an excuse.

529
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,140
I need some comm unit modifications.

530
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,900
I need a certified digital audio transfer rate of 6.8.

531
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,170
I can only get to 6.5.

532
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,730
Can you do that without talking?

533
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,610
I could, but it'd be a terrible waste of my charm.

534
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,090
Okay. I'm not listening anymore.

535
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,830
Call me when you're done. Thanks.

536
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,760
Behind me, you can see preparations

537
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,950
as the casket bearing the body of David Palmer is expected here shortly.

538
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,110
It will be met by President Logan who is scheduled

539
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,230
to make a statement before he flies back to Washington...

540
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,880
Is Aaron safe?

541
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,210
Yes.

542
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,920
Thank God.

543
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,110
I can't believe Charles is going to do this.

544
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,110
He has David's blood on his hand, 

545
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,950
he has the audacity to eulogize him in front of the whole world.

546
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,550
Mrs. Logan...

547
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,920
I said earlier there was no way to make a case against your husband. I was wrong.

548
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,620
Jack Bauer, the former CTU agent, 

549
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,480
contacted Aaron and me. He's on his way here now.

550
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,580
What for?

551
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,450
He's going to confront your husband directly.

552
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,210
Confront him?

553
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,790
Would he hurt him?

554
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,740
Jack Bauer will do whatever it takes 

555
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,900
to compel your husband to confess the truth.

556
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,830
He's the only one I know who can do this.

557
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,490
When will he be here?

558
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,760
15 minutes.

559
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,400
But Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately.

560
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,150
I know, I know, I tried to delay him myself, 

561
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,910
but he wouldn't change his schedule. That's why I'm coming to you.

562
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,220
I need you to keep him here.

563
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,640
Martha...

564
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,800
if you want your husband brought to justice, 

565
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,730
this is our only chance.

566
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,030
You have to find the way to staller him.

567
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,570
Aaron, it's good to see you.

568
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,200
Same here, Jack.

569
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,960
Was Mike able to delay the President?

570
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,830
He's trying. But he had to ask Mrs. Logan for some help.

571
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,000
The First Lady knows what we intend to do?

572
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,070
She does.

573
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,320
Aaron...

574
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,040
Can she be trusted?

575
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,450
She is with us, Jack...

576
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,840
100%.

577
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,300
Can you still get access to the Secret Service deployment grid?

578
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,300
I already have.

579
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,340
The way security has been beefed up around the main building, 

580
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,510
there's no way you're going to be able to get Logan alone there.

581
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,270
Is Marine One taking him to the airfield?

582
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,710
No, this was last minute.

583
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,690
They're transporting him by reduced detachment.

584
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,370
They're using a Navy helicopter.

585
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,620
That's where this has to happen.

586
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,920
I need to get on that chopper.

587
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,900
I don't see how that's going to be possible.

588
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,430
Aaron, you get me as close to that helicopter as you can,

589
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,470
and then we'll figure it out from there.

590
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,690
All right.

591
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,370
Let's go.

592
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,430
Yes, I agree, Wayne Palmer should be at the airfield.

593
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,480
But if you can't find him, I'm not going to wait for him.

594
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,800
Yes, I'm leaving now.

595
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,710
Have a copy of my speech on the chopper, 

596
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,520
and I'll work on it on the flight over.

597
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,400
I'll be out of your way in a second.

598
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,510
I saw on your schedule that 

599
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,400
you're meeting David Palmer's casket at the airfield.

600
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,260
If you came here to judge me, Martha, I really don't have time...

601
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,740
No, no.

602
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,400
That's not it.

603
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,740
I've had time to reflect and I...

604
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,450
I think I owe you an apology.

605
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,970
All right.

606
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,740
I said some horrible things to you.

607
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,940
I've had horrible things said to me before...

608
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,270
and by you.

609
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,740
But there was one thing you said that I can't get over.

610
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,870
What?

611
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,250
That I broke your heart...

612
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,210
and that you hated me.

613
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,540
Well, I wish I could take those words back.

614
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,130
All I can ask now is that you forgive me.

615
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,690
Please, Charles...

616
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,450
I don't know how to respond, Marty.

617
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,110
I never expected you to say anything like this.

618
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,160
I mean it, Charles, I...

619
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,090
I mean it, I need you to forgive me.

620
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,510
You mean it now, but you know how you are.

621
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,700
By tomorrow, I could be the man you hate again.

622
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,880
I know.

623
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,100
It'll take time for me to prove myself to you, 

624
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,330
but the truth is...

625
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,070
even though sometimes I don't understand you, 

626
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,550
I still need you.

627
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,390
And I still love you.

628
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,530
And that will never change, Charles.

629
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,620
Not tomorrow, not ever.

630
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,900
I need you, too, Marty.

631
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,320
Fly with me to Washington.

632
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,300
We can spend some time together.

633
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,610
On a plane surrounded by Secret Service?

634
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,600
Why can't we just spend a little more time here, together, alone?

635
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,220
You know that's not possible. I have to go.

636
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,980
I had to go five minutes ago.

637
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,680
Okay, Charles.

638
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,350
You go.

639
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,820
Come with me.

640
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,810
I have a better idea.

641
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,080
There's a helicopter waiting for me.

642
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,320
Let it wait.

643
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,560
I can't.

644
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,490
Yes, you can.

645
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,970
You're the President.

646
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,320
Tell the helicopter to stand by.

647
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,840
Yes.

648
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,970
Until I'm ready.

649
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,110
And make sure I'm not disturbed.

650
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,480
It's clear.

651
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,400
Yeah.

652
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,040
The President just notified Secret Service he's going to be delayed.

653
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,050
How long?

654
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,230
He didn't say.

655
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,550
But Mrs. Logan knows we need as much time as possible.

656
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,130
Jack...

657
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,670
if Logan doesn't confess, 

658
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,830
how far are you actually willing to go?

659
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,500
As far as I have to.

660
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


661
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,430
Coordinates for the targets

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,430
upload them into the missiles.

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,160
Begin the launch countdown.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,600
How much time do you need to cancel the launch sequence?

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,160
I won't know for certain till I see

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,600
how the targeting software is configured.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,460
We're going to keep Bierko and his men out of here,

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,930
so you can finish this.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,430
Ten seconds to launch.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,500
It's done.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,030
The launch sequence is canceled.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,230
You were never really going to let me go, were you?

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,460
No.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,400
You were responsible for the deaths

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,460
of David Palmer and Tony Almeida

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,000
and Michelle Dessler.

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,960
I'm going after Logan.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,100
What do you mean, "going after Logan" ?

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,030
I'll fill you in on the details later.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,430
Right now, I need you to walk me through

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,330
modifying some field communications equipment.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,700
- Who is this guy?  - Morris O'Brian, Chloe's ex-husband.

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,960
I need some com unit modifications.

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,330
Can you do that without talking?

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,130
I could, but it would be a terrible waste of my charm.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,030
Jack Bauer's on his way here now.

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,660
He's going to confront your husband directly.

28
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,160
But Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately.

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,360
You have to find a way to stall him.

30
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,900
There's a helicopter waiting for me.

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,800
- Let it wait.  - I can't.

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,860
Yes, you can.

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,100
You're the president.

34
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,560
Aaron said the recording you had

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,700
implicating the president was destroyed.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Yes.

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,860
Without it, you can't mount a case.

38
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,330
I'm working with someone inside CTU.

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,800
They're setting up a digital uplink.

40
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,030
If I can get Logan to acknowledge

41
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,260
everything that he's done today,

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,660
it's going to be all the evidence we need.

43
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,730
I need to get on that chopper.

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,300
I don't see how that's gonna be possible.

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,900
If Logan doesn't confess,

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,030
how far are you actually willing to go?

47
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,300
As far as I have to.

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Ah...

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,360
Here, let me get this for you.

50
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,360
Watch your hair.

51
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,030
Thank you.

52
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,230
You're welcome.

53
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,460
I got a flight suit.

54
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,060
Go ahead.

55
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,360
Did you make it to the Secret Service outbuilding?

56
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,430
Yeah.

57
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,930
I think Morris and I may have a way

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,200
to pull the copilot from the flight.

59
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,030
What about the reassignment protocol?

60
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Working on it.

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,560
Mike Novick will have to verify the pilot codes.

62
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,000
It should take him about one minute.

63
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,030
Chloe, hold on a second.

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,460
- I'm switching over to com.  - Okay.

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,930
Do you copy?

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,430
Yeah.

67
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
I'll get back to you as soon as I'm on the chopper.

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,860
Mike Novick's going to call.

69
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,900
Morris.

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,730
Yes, sweetheart?

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,960
I need you to do one more thing.

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,230
Some guy from Central just called.

73
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,260
Says your packet's messed up.

74
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,630
I got that straightened out Monday.

75
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,760
I guess not.

76
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,200
- He wants to talk to you.  - Now?

77
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,900
Right now. He had me patch you through

78
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,800
to the Secret Service outbuilding.

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,460
Mike.

80
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,030
I've delayed him as long as I can.

81
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,260
He'll be there in a few minutes.

82
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,860
Have you heard anything from Jack Bauer yet?

83
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,230
He should be in the Secret Service outbuilding. 

84
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm sending him the necessary documents now.

85
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,200
There's not much time.

86
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,460
I understand.

87
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,730
Yeah, Mike. The reassignment protocol

88
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,860
and authorization should be coming through to you.

89
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,000
He'll need both.

90
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,360
How are we doing for time?

91
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,430
Hurry.

92
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,700
Hello.

93
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,830
Hello.

94
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,330
John.

95
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,730
Aaron.

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,760
I thought you transferred out.

97
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,000
Not quite yet.

98
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,300
Some guy from Central called,

99
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,930
said my packet's all messed...

100
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,530
You'll need this, Don't worry about him.

101
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,600
Carruth has been relieved.

102
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,560
I guess there was something wrong with his packet.

103
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,860
Ron Franklin.

104
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,360
There's my protocol.

105
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,160
This is not bad,

106
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,300
but it needs to be more positive,

107
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,500
like, uh...

108
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,730
Jack Bauer is on the helicopter.

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
You have to find an excuse

110
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,500
not to get on board.

111
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Um... Carolyn, do you have the itinerary?

112
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,830
Charles?

113
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,100
Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a second?

114
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,060
Absolutely.

115
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,530
Will you excuse us for a second?

116
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,960
I know it sounds silly,

117
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,230
but I didn't bring my medication.

118
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,500
and I just, I just want to have it with me.

119
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,730
Of course. Of course.

120
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,160
- We'll send somebody back for it.  - No, no, no.

121
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,800
I don't want to delay you.

122
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,260
I'll be along later. Besides, Charles,

123
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,660
I... I'm thinking that when you land,

124
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,660
it would be better

125
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,660
if I wasn't with you.

126
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,600
Why?

127
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,230
This is your moment, Charles.

128
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,130
I... I think that...

129
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,730
when you step out of that helicopter alone,

130
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,130
after saving the country,

131
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,430
that is an image that history will never forget.

132
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,700
All right.

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,700
Thank you, Marti.

134
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,330
But don't be

135
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,360
far behind me, now.

136
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,600
I won't.

137
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,100
Thank you.

138
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,230
Captain.

139
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,260
I can fly this thing if I have to,

140
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,860
which leaves you with one of two choices.

141
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,730
You either do what I say and you live, or you don't

142
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,100
and you die for nothing. You understand me?

143
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,760
I want you to wait until I give you my command, then

144
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,000
follow these instructions slowly.

145
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,730
You're going to disconnect your helmet from

146
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,230
the communications system. Then I want you

147
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,460
to rip out the mic cable,

148
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,960
take your helmet off and stow it.

149
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,660
Do it now.

150
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,600
I'll know if you deviate from your flight plan.

151
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,160
Mr President!

152
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,460
I have a message for you from the White House!

153
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,160
What the hell are you doing?!

154
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,200
Put these on!

155
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,560
You.

156
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,730
This is Jack. Do you copy?

157
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,830
I'm here, Jack. Where are you?

158
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,730
We just left the ranch. I have Logan with me.

159
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,560
Is Morris standing by with the equipment?

160
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,500
He's on his way. I'll let him know you're airborne.

161
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,000
Make sure the pilot takes heading 2... 8... 6 for two miles,

162
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,430
then breaks south.

163
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,460
Captain!

164
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,330
I want you to follow heading 2... 8... 6 for two miles,

165
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,300
then break south.

166
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,630
Once you break south, there should be an industrial park.

167
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,130
There's an abandoned printing press facility

168
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,160
that you can use.

169
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,230
I'll get back to you.

170
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,230
Copy that.

171
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,700
What are you trying to do, Jack?

172
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,600
Whatever it is, you know you won't

173
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,800
get away with it.

174
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,960
Are you going to kill me?

175
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,860
I suppose you want some sort of revenge.

176
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,660
I understand that.

177
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,630
Bad things happened.

178
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,430
I didn't want them to happen.

179
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,800
People who worked for me... they... they went too far.

180
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,700
They did things that they thought

181
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
I wanted them to do, but they were wrong.

182
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,960
You have to understand.

183
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,060
I have always

184
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,400
acted in the country's best interest.

185
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,560
But you're just trying to get even.

186
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,960
Do you realize

187
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,530
what effect this will have on the American people?

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
This day has been trying enough,

189
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,000
and now the President is being attacked.

190
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,930
If you want to do what's right,

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,230
you will turn this thing around and go back.

192
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,400
Damn it, Bauer, say something!

193
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,730
Hello.

194
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,760
Morris.

195
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,060
Yes, love.

196
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,930
The helicopter is landing in an industrial park

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,930
one mile due east of where you are.

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,560
Head over there.

199
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,900
Okay, now, I give this guy what we worked on,

200
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
and then I'm out, right?

201
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,260
Yes, but make sure you have him call me

202
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,660
when you do the hand-off.

203
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,960
- All right.  - Thanks.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,030
Shut it down!

205
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,300
Your safety belt.

206
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,300
Move towards the door slowly.

207
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,300
Get down now. Move!

208
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,730
Jack, maybe we can work something out.

209
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,730
There's still time.

210
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,830
What do you want?

211
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,530
I can help you get away from here

212
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,300
with enough money to start a new life,

213
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,600
maybe find that daughter of yours.

214
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,560
Try to work something out.

215
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,330
Whatever you want, it's yours.

216
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
You have my word.

217
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,260
Your word.

218
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,330
Jack, I'm the President of the United States.

219
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,460
I'm not, I'm not carrying any weapons.

220
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,760
Don't you make a sound.

221
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,130
Hey.

222
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,300
Give me the case.

223
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,700
Jack Bauer.

224
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,730
I should have known that.

225
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,730
Modified equipment.

226
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,230
Yeah.

227
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,530
Oh, that's President Logan, Jack.

228
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,560
Get out of here.

229
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah. Chloe wants you to call her.

230
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,260
Go.

231
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,100
Yeah, Jack?

232
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,100
I have him.

233
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,300
All right.

234
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,800
I've just checked the response deployment.

235
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,260
You have less than ten minutes until they're on you.

236
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,300
Fine.

237
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,960
Listen, Jack.

238
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,060
I don't mean to put any added pressure on you,

239
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,930
but if you don't have a confession by then,

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,430
we'll all be arrested for treason.

241
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,930
Yeah, I know.

242
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,100
Is this some kind of broadcast?

243
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,630
What is this?

244
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,500
I would like to know. Is this an assassination?

245
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,200
A confession.

246
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,800
Don't count on it.

247
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,660
I know you're good at extracting information.

248
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,360
I know that you're good at torture.

249
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,160
I saw what you did with Walt Cummings.

250
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,300
I think you'll be surprised to find out

251
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
that I'm a little tougher than that.

252
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,630
Take a seat.

253
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,000
Chloe, it's Jack. Can you hear me?

254
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,160
Yeah, Jack.

255
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,230
I want to make sure that you have good reception.

256
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,430
Who you talking to? Are those your friends at CTU?

257
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,560
You know you're putting them in danger, as well.

258
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,930
Coming through fine, Jack.

259
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,100
Okay, good.

260
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,200
My people can't be far behind, Jack.

261
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,160
There's still time to get away. Take it.

262
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,800
The plan involving the Sentox nerve gas,

263
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,160
it was designed to fool the terrorists and the Russians.

264
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,660
Whether or not you formulated the plan is irrelevant.

265
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,330
- You authorized it.  - You're delusional.

266
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,100
David Palmer uncovered evidence of this plan.

267
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,300
When he started asking questions, he was assassinated.

268
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,460
Other people were killed to cover that murder up. 

269
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,060
Men and women who served this country with distinction;

270
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,700
people that I worked with; friends of mine.

271
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,030
No, you're wrong.

272
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,500
This is all a pack of lies.

273
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,160
The terrorists discovered your deception.

274
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,300
And they deployed Sentox nerve gas on American soil.

275
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,700
Every American who died today

276
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,530
as a result of terrorist activity

277
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,360
is another murder that you're accountable for.

278
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,060
And before you leave here, you're going to admit it.

279
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,860
I suppose if you hurt me enough, Jack,

280
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,730
I'll say whatever you want,

281
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,400
but that won't make it the truth.

282
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,700
And everybody who watches this will know that perfectly well.

283
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,060
What are the names of your co-conspirators?

284
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,160
There are no co-conspirators, because there is no...

285
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,160
Walt Cummings,

286
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,730
Christopher Henderson,

287
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,630
James Nathanson have all admitted

288
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,460
to being part of this conspiracy!

289
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,860
Now they are dead!

290
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,630
Right before Christopher Henderson died

291
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,100
he acknowledged that there were others!

292
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,900
What are their names?

293
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,060
A man will say anything under torture.

294
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,860
This won't mean a thing.

295
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,130
Mr Logan, I'm not going to torture you,

296
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,200
but you are going to tell me what I want to know.

297
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,930
Or so help me God,

298
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,630
I will kill you.

299
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,400
A year and a half ago,

300
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,630
I was warned that my life was in danger

301
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,730
by someone within the government.

302
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,300
I was told the only way I could stay alive

303
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,960
was to create the illusion that I was dead.

304
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,130
I was forced to deceive people that I loved.

305
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,030
My only daughter will never forgive me.

306
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,160
As I see the depth of your corruption unfold,

307
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,200
I have no doubt that you are that source of danger.

308
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,930
David Palmer was a great man.

309
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,560
And he was a great president.

310
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,760
He was also my friend.

311
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,260
He tried to warn me about you

312
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,930
and now he is dead.

313
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,260
Other people tried to help me

314
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,500
and they are dead, too.

315
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,360
So, Mr Logan, I hope you understand

316
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,660
I have absolutely nothing to lose.

317
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,060
You are going to be held accountable

318
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,160
for your part of everything that happened today.

319
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,360
You are not going to be able to hide behind the presidency.

320
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,930
Right here, right now,

321
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,400
you are going to face justice!

322
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,730
And make no mistake about this, this is personal.

323
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,230
And if you think for a second

324
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,800
that I am scared to put a bullet in your brain,

325
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,230
you don't know me.

326
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
I'm going to ask you one last time,

327
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,730
who are your co-conspirators?

328
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,500
You have until the count of three,

329
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,500
or I will kill you.

330
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,200
One...

331
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,500
You make me a martyr, I'll go down in history with Lincoln

332
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,460
and Kennedy, but you'll go down with John Wilkes Booth

333
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,230
and Lee Harvey Oswald. Is that what you want?

334
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,030
Two!

335
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,900
You're a man of honor.

336
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,760
How can you assassinate a president of the United States

337
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,430
in front of the entire world?

338
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,900
If you love your country, you won't pull the trigger.

339
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,760
Three!

340
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,630
You can't do it, can you?

341
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,260
No, Jack, it's all right.

342
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,360
Jack, it's all right. It's all right.

343
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,830
It's all right that you can't.

344
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,130
I'm the president.

345
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,130
Jack, they're here.

346
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,130
Lay flat on your stomach!

347
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,830
Put your hands out in front of you!

348
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,400
Extend your arms!

349
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,160
Mr President, are you all right?

350
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,700
I'm fine.

351
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,360
I actually feel sorry for that man.

352
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,130
He's delusional.

353
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,430
It would be better if he were put

354
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,830
in some sort of solitary confinement

355
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,000
for the time being.

356
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,930
Jack Bauer

357
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,430
wasn't able to get the President to confess,

358
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,560
Mrs Logan.

359
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,630
Why not? What happened?

361
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,900
I'm not sure of the details.

362
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,200
Bauer's in custody.

363
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,500
Gentlemen.

364
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,030
Thank you.

365
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,860
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

366
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,030
That will be all. Thank you so much.

367
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,900
David...

368
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,000
- Marti, don't do this to me now.  - You killed him.

369
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,330
You killed him.

370
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,630
- You're a murderer.  - Stop.

371
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,600
You are! You're a criminal!

372
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,600
My wife is not well.

373
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,760
- Would you please escort her?  - Get off me!

374
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,530
Don't you touch me!

375
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,130
- Don't you touch me!  - Escort her into the hangar, please.

376
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,000
You don't know what he did! He's not fit to be president!

377
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,760
It is a sacrilege for him to be even speaking David's name!

378
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,830
Don't... !

379
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,060
No!

380
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,000
I want to make sure that she's all right.

381
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,160
Has the hangar been cleared?

382
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,560
Yes, sir. All secure.

383
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,230
- It's empty.  - Good.

384
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,500
Let them know that I'll be back in a moment.

385
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,130
Yes, Mr President.

386
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,230
You're not wearing some kind of listening device, are you?

387
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,800
What are you talking about?

388
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,700
I have to watch you now, Marti.

389
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,300
You said that I was a good liar,

390
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,930
but I am nothing compared to you.

391
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
Charles! Stop it!

392
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,930
Stop it!

393
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,060
- Charles...  - Yeah, Marti.

394
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,900
Tell me the truth.

395
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,300
You're hurting me.

396
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,230
You don't know what pain is.

397
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,360
I'm on to you, Marti.

398
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,500
I should've seen it from the first,

399
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,260
but I wanted to believe that you still cared for me.

400
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,730
Making love to me was just a ploy, wasn't it?

401
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,360
Took a lot of planning

402
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,260
to get Jack Bauer on that helicopter.

403
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,000
You were part of that plan, weren't you?

404
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,600
It was your job to delay me, wasn't it?

405
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,800
Wasn't it?!

406
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,430
Please...

407
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,460
Wasn't it?

408
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,600
They used you

409
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,700
so Jack Bauer could get to me.

410
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,730
Come on, Marti. Come on, Marti.

411
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,230
Admit it, you were part of it.

412
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,660
Yes. Yes.

413
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Why?

414
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,200
Why?

415
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,660
Why did you help them?

416
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,100
Because you killed David Palmer.

417
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,500
I told you I didn't realize that was going to happen.

418
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,860
Your people killed him to protect you.

419
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,560
You covered it up, that's just as bad.

420
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,700
I covered it up because I had to.

421
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,630
Oh, and then others died to cover that up.

422
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,330
That's right, for the good of the country.

423
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,000
You sold nerve gas to terrorists.

424
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,100
You're insane.

425
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,800
You're insane!

426
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,230
I did it for the good of the country as I saw it at the time.

427
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,000
You're such a hypocrite.

428
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,030
After your little performance this morning,

429
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,830
you're in no position to call me a hypocrite.

430
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,830
And I will tell you something else...

431
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,230
if you blow up like this one more time...

432
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I will fill you so full of drugs,

433
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,630
you won't even remember your own name.

434
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,060
And then I will ship you off to an asylum

435
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,960
and you can stay there for the rest of your life.

436
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,730
Are we clear?

437
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,500
Are we clear?

438
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,560
My fellow Americans,

439
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,030
this has been a terrible day in the history of this country,

440
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,330
and yet at the same time, a triumphant day,

441
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,560
because in the end, we won a significant victory

442
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,930
over the forces of chaos and terror.

443
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,100
We have preserved and protected our way of life,

444
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,430
despite the loss of innocent American lives.

445
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,830
I'll start the transmission in one minute. 

446
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,960
Is the Attorney General there?

447
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,930
I'm here, Ms O'Brian. I certainly hope

448
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,830
this recording is as important as you claim it is.

449
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,030
Chloe, what's this about?

450
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,960
I set up a conference call with

451
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,560
the Attorney General. He's on speakerphone now.

452
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,630
Are you serious?

453
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,860
I'm very serious.

454
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,800
Mr. Attorney General, this is Karen Hayes, Homeland Security.

455
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,130
Bill Buchanan, CTU.

456
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,290
Sir, I apologize. Ms O'Brian placed this call without

457
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,330
- authorization from me.  - I'm sorry I had to do that.

458
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,830
We had to do things under the radar

459
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,960
to protect you all in case things went wrong.

460
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,560
In case what things went wrong?

461
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,100
I think it would help if I just played the recording.

462
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,530
What recording?

463
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,130
It's a conversation that took place five minutes ago

464
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,360
between the President and his wife.

465
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,630
How could you

466
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,390
possibly have a recording of something like that?

467
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,700
Sir, an agent named Jack Bauer placed a listening device

468
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,130
on the President shortly before this conversation.

469
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,430
Bauer? Isn't he the one that's under arrest?

470
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm going to play the recording now.

471
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,330
I don't want to listen to it.

472
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,390
Ms O'Brian, at the very least, this constitutes

473
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,360
an egregious violation of privacy,

474
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,000
and we're talking about the President.

475
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,530
...'cause you killed David Palmer.

476
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,460
I told you, I didn't realize that was going to happen.

477
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,030
Your people killed him to protect you.

478
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,700
You covered it up, that's just as bad.

479
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,160
I covered it up because I had to.

480
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,290
Oh, and then others died to cover that up!

481
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,500
That's right, for the good of the country.

482
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,100
You sold nerve gas to terrorists.

483
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,000
You're insane. You're insane!

484
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,630
A poet once said, "No man is an island. "

485
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,560
On a day like this, we can feel the truth of those words.

486
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,700
Any untimely death is a tragedy.

487
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,630
Yet some men embody such greatness of character

488
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,100
that their death serves as a unifying force

489
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,730
for those who remain behind.

490
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,230
David Palmer was such a man.

491
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40,600
A great President, a great American

492
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:46,700
and on a more personal note, a wonderful friend.

493
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,000
He'll be missed...

494
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,230
- ...more than words can express...  - Holtzman.

495
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,930
Yes, sir.

496
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,430
We take this moment to remember with appreciation...

497
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,430
With all due respect, Mr Attorney General,

498
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,730
are you sure this isn't some kind of mistake?

499
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,160
Yes, sir.

500
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,430
I understand, sir.

501
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,900
I'll do exactly as you say.

502
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,260
...combination of wisdom, strength and moral courage,

503
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,760
this country might have not survived in its present form.

504
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,700
It's very appropriate that David Palmer will be laid to rest

505
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,000
in Arlington Cemetery,

506
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,630
for he was a soldier in the truest sense.

507
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,700
He was a man whose courage rose in direct proportion

508
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,100
to the threats his country faced.

509
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,760
In closing, I would ask that the country

510
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,230
observe a national day of mourning

511
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,260
for one of the greatest Americans

512
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,600
this nation will ever see.

513
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,330
Thank you very much.

514
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,330
Federal marshall. Would you please come with us?

515
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,060
What the hell do you think you're doing?

516
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,960
You came very close to disrupting my speech.

517
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,760
On behalf of President Logan,

518
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,630
I wish to thank you all very much for joining us.

519
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,630
I am sorry, but out of respect for today's...

520
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,800
Those are ridiculous accusations.

521
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,530
Excuse me. If I may, sir?

522
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,000
You've probably never seen one of these, Mr President.

523
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,100
It's a micro-transmitter.

524
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,530
Agent Clark, arrest these men

525
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
and get them the hell out of here.

526
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,860
I'm sorry. Mr President.

527
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,900
We have our orders.

528
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,700
You take... !

529
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,260
You take your orders from me.

530
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,030
Not anymore.

531
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,100
After you, sir.

532
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,730
Attention!

533
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,100
Aim, fire!

534
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,960
Attention!

535
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,200
Aim,

536
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,330
fire!

537
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:56,830
Attention!

538
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,730
Aim,

539
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,530
fire!

540
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,390
Present arms.

541
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,130
Sir.

542
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,930
Give me a second.

543
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,100
Hey.

544
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,030
Hey.

545
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,330
Thank God you're safe.

546
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,430
Everything's going to be all right.

547
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,200
Jack, when I heard you kidnapped the President...

548
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,500
I was just trying to get him to give me a direct confession.

549
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,560
Jack...

550
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,830
How much longer do you need to stay here?

551
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,160
Not much longer. They can debrief me tomorrow.

552
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,600
You sure?

553
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,700
I can't believe you're really,

554
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,900
you're really here.

555
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,760
Agent Bauer,

556
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,730
excuse me, but there's a call for you

557
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,730
from your daughter.

558
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,030
From my daughter?

559
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,500
Yes, sir. A Kim Bauer. It's been put through

560
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,990
to a land line just inside that door.

561
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,900
Thank you.

562
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,730
I'll be right back. I promise.

563
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
Take as long as you need.

564
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,390
I'm not going anywhere.

565
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,730
I love you.

566
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,260
I'll be right back.

567
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,060
Hey, Kim?

568
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,300
Any word on Logan?

569
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,930
No. My guess is he'll try to cut a deal.

570
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,530
He'll resign without a fight

571
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,300
in exchange for clemency.

572
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,700
He doesn't deserve clemency.

573
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,130
No, but the country doesn't deserve

574
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,230
a long impeachment process, either,

575
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,230
with everything that's happened.

576
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,700
In any event, we can expect

577
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,360
Hal Gordon to be sworn in as president soon.

578
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,300
Which means this will probably be the last time

579
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,300
I see this place.

580
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,030
I don't think so.

581
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,960
Not if I have anything to do with it,

582
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,960
and I will.

583
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,900
You'll be back here running CTU.

584
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,860
Thank you. I appreciate that.

585
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:37,500
When I came in here last night to save the day,

586
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,660
I was a little bit condescending and tactless,

587
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,500
to say the least.

588
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,100
I had no idea what you were up against.

589
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
I'm sorry.

590
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,400
No. No need to apologize.

591
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,660
Mistakes were made.

592
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,800
You were right to come in with a firm hand.

593
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,130
Well, I better go.

594
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,500
Karen.

595
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,460
I was thinking of getting some breakfast

596
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,960
before going home.

597
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,730
I have to go over to Division for one last briefing.

598
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,900
Bureaucracy.

599
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,430
Rain check?

600
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,800
Sure.

601
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,960
Chloe,

602
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,000
really good work today.

603
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,730
You, too.

604
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,760
I found this in Edgar's possessions.

605
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,030
I thought you should have it.

606
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,260
Thanks.

607
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,730
Hey.

608
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,260
What's all this, then?

609
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,700
A friend of mine who died today.

610
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,230
You, um, do you want to talk about it?

611
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,400
Yeah? Come on.

612
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,600
Jack?

613
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,530
Oh, my God.

614
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,060
Agent Davis, Jack Bauer's missing!

615
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,530
Attention, all units.

616
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,030
We have a missing agent: Jack Bauer.

617
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,730
I repeat, we have a missing agent: Jack Bauer.

618
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,300
... the lower level.

619
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,700
Put three men on perimeter search.

620
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,530
Report back.

621
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,500
You surely must be aware, Mr Bauer,

622
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,730
that China has a long memory.

623
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,760
Only 18 months ago,

624
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,730
you invaded our territory

625
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,500
and killed our consul.

626
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,660
Did you really think that we would forget, hmm?

627
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,860
I know how this works.

628
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,460
I need to make one phone call.

629
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,730
Please...

630
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,730
just one phone call.

631
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,600
Kill me.

632
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,200
Just...

633
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,600
kill me.

634
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,530
Kill you?

635
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,330
You're far too valuable to kill, Mr Bauer.

636
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


637
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
