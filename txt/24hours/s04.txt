1
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,490
Please help me!

2
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,080
I can't move!

3
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,210
Help me! I can't move!

4
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,590
Oh my god!

5
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,110
Sarah, save what you're doing and log out. I need you on something now.

6
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,910
What is it?

7
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,990
I just heard from one of our sources.

8
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,710
There's a high probability that someone from our FBI watchlist was spotted in L.A. yesterday.

9
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,380
Thomas Sharek. Who is he?

10
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,380
He's done work with several terrorist cells outside Istanbul.

11
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,880
Coordinating several suicide bombings last summer.

12
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,180
Istanbul...

13
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,680
There was some chatter this morning about a possible attack by a group out of Turkey.

14
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,680
Here it is. From Ankara.

15
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,600
What was the target?

16
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,690
East Coast. New York or D.C.

17
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,400
But the time window passed.

18
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,110
Passed?

19
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,400
The targetted time was for 8 A.M. It's already past 10 on the East Coast.

20
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,120
What if they got the target wrong and it's West Coast time?

21
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,990
Then it's gonna go down within the hour.

22
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,710
Tell Curtis, I'll take this to Driscoll.

23
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,790
I can take it to her.

24
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,790
Why?

25
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
I thought you wanted to keep working it up.

26
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,210
You know, you're really transparent, Sarah. Stop trying to be Driscoll's pet,

27
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,300
she doesn't like it.

28
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,600
Have you had voice confirmation from anyone on the train?

29
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,310
No, the signal has just confirmed a bomb.

30
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,190
We're trying to get in contact now.

31
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,110
It's in a remote area but local police are heading to the scene.

32
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,610
Alright.

33
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,990
We have discretionary authority out of Point Magoo.

34
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,700
Have them direct one of their patrol aircraft over the area.

35
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Put the pilot in contact with our people.

36
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,700
Should we monitor emergency services?

37
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,790
No, County will cover that.

38
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,580
A truck loaded with C4 just derailed a train in Santa Clarita.

39
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,210
Free up some of your people. Division's gonne send over data.

40
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,710
That could be realted to what we just found downstairs.

41
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,590
What did you found?

42
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,300
Two things. First, there was intelligence indicating the possibility of an attack

43
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,800
at 8 o'clock this morning.

44
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,680
Bombing was at 7. That's within an hour of the time.

45
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,000
What's the second thing?

46
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,800
A Turkish national on the FBI watchlist by the name of Thomas Sharek

47
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,190
was last seen in the city. He could be related to the bombing.

48
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,190
Okay.

49
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,610
Open up channels with Divison. Start investigating this bombing.

50
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,610
And work up what you have on Sharek.

51
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,620
We'll brief in a few minutes.

52
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,080
What about the Defence Department meeting? It's in a half hour.

53
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,580
Who's secretary Heller sending?

54
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,580
Jack Bauer.

55
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,500
Jack... You sure?

56
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,210
Yeah, he hasn't been back...

57
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,210
well, since you fired him.

58
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,900
Is it gonna be uncomfortable?

59
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,190
What?

60
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,780
Going back to CTU. Seeing Driscoll again.

61
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,990
I don't blame her for her decision.

62
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,910
How can that be? She forced you out of CTU.

63
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,280
She didn't want a junky on her staff. That's not unreasonable.

64
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,790
You weren't a junky. You were doing your job.

65
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,920
I was addicted to heroin.

66
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,580
It didn't matter why.

67
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you miss your old job?

68
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,010
I could have joined other agencies if I still wanted to do field work.

69
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,390
But I didn't.

70
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,600
I wanted something different for my life.

71
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,880
It might not seem like a lot to you.

72
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,180
But for me,

73
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,180
to be able to have this kind of connections.

74
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,600
I couldn't do that before.

75
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,690
I'm glad you can now.

76
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,490
We'd better go.

77
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,780
Yeah.

78
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,910
Secretary Heller is gonna be in the lobby in 5 minutes.

79
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,080
Secretary Heller?

80
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,920
Yeah, I called him Dad once in a press conference

81
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,090
so I decided then to use his title all the time.

82
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,710
Audrey.

83
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,510
Your father is a very perceptive man.

84
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,180
I would like to tell him about us before he finds out on his own.

85
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,600
Look...

86
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,480
My Dad is kind of old-fashioned.

87
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,190
Even though Paul and I are separated, he...

88
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,190
he still considers us married.

89
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,820
I understand that.

90
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,280
And I don't want your father to draw the wrong conclusion

91
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,700
and think that I had anything to do with the break-up between you and Paul.

92
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,700
Yeah, but you didn't.

93
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,780
Please Jack.

94
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,580
Let's just give it a little more time.

95
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,580
I'm gonna tell you something and I don't want you to panick.

96
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,590
I'm falling in love with you.

97
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,010
Look, I don't want you to say anything.

98
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,510
And I don't need you to feel the same way.

99
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,810
I just wanted you to know.

100
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,190
I will see you downstairs.

101
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,590
Alright.

102
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,090
Here is what we have

103
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,590
a known terrorist named Thomas Sharek

104
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,800
managed through the country undetected.

105
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,680
We believe there's a likely hood Sharek helped organized the train attack in Santa Clarita.

106
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,810
If he did,

107
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,900
he's gonna get out of the country as fast as he can.

108
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,190
Which means we have a small window of opportunity here.

109
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,690
Who's covering airport and costumes?

110
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,780
I am.

111
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,610
I've issued a mandate to LAX, Long Beach and Ontario.

112
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,490
As usual, we can't hear you.

113
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,580
Also, where's your labtop in case you need to pull data?

114
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,410
I'm sorry I'll speak up and

115
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,210
I don't need my labtop, I have everything memorized.

116
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,590
What I was saying is that I have contacted all the airports and security.

117
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,380
Do we have any local contacts with Sharek?

118
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,090
We're looking into those now.

119
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,010
Alright.

120
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,010
Promote everything we receive up to Division.

121
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,100
Let's find Sharek before he leaves the city.

122
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,180
Let's go.

123
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,890
Excuse me, Mrs Driscoll. Don't you think it's a mistake

124
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,480
to assume that Sharek is on his way out of L.A.?

125
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,310
No.

126
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,820
But the timing on the intel doesn't quite match.

127
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,110
It said 8 A.M. and the train bombing happened around 7.

128
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,780
Just focus on finding Sharek.

129
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,080
Yes?

130
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,290
It's Thomas.

131
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,210
Did Dar get the briefcase?

132
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,210
Yes.

133
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,290
- He's on his way to you now.  - Good.

134
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,000
You did well Thomas.

135
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,800
What about Maris?

136
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,090
He's waiting for you.

137
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,720
He has everything you need.

138
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,480
Berous, are you eating with us?

139
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,190
I'll be right down, mum.

140
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,110
I'm concerned about him.

141
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,110
Concerned? Why?

142
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,410
I think he's still seeing this American girl, Debbie.

143
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,990
You said you talked to him.

144
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,910
I did.

145
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,000
I told him he was no longer allowed to have contact with her.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,710
And he agreed, right?

147
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,510
Yes, but I think he's still seeing her behind our backs.

148
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,590
I'll speak to him.

149
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,380
No.

150
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,090
I'll take care of it.

151
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,400
Berous, we're sitting down to eat.

152
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,690
Berous?

153
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,190
I'm on the phone.

154
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,400
Get off and come down now.

155
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,580
Who was he talking to?

156
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,790
I don't know.

157
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,210
Sorry.

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,090
Who were you on the phone with?

159
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,710
My pal, Scott.

160
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,590
You were talking to that American girl.

161
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,090
No, I told you I don't see her anymore.

162
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,510
Don't lie to me, Berous.

163
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,180
I hear your phone calls at night.

164
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,520
I read your e-mails.

165
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,890
You read my e-mails?

166
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,390
That's my business!

167
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,190
Don't you raise your voice to your father!

168
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,480
While you live under my roof, there's no such thing

169
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,690
as your business.

170
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,780
No more communications with that girl.

171
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,910
Do you understand me?

172
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,700
Don't look at her you're talking to me.

173
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,500
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,710
... Horrible tragedy occured a short time ago.

175
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,580
An early morning communer train

176
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,500
collided with a pickup truck

177
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,510
that was apparently crossing the track.

178
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,510
Most of the passengers were severely injured.

179
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,100
Casualty estimates as high as 30.

180
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,310
NTSP have arrived at the scene and are investigating the cause.

181
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,100
At this time, the authorities are not saying whether this was an accident

182
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,190
or a targeted attack but as you can see there has been a...

183
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,190
So far, everything is on schedule.

184
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,990
Have you spoken to Thomas?

185
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,990
Yes, the briefcase is on its way to us now.

186
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,490
When it gets here,

187
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,910
you'll take it to the warehouse.

188
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,200
Why doesn't Dar take it directly?

189
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,000
He doesn't need to know where our people are working.

190
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,210
That's the safest way.

191
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,210
Berous,

192
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,090
if your father seem severe,

193
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,180
it's because our job here is a difficult one.

194
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,600
If we are to succeed,

195
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,680
it's important that we are of a single mind.

196
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,190
I understand.

197
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,610
What we will accomplish today will change the world.

198
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,610
We're fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this.

199
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,410
We cannot fail.

200
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,410
Yes, father.

201
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,110
- Morning, Jennifer.  - Morning.

202
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,980
What are you doing here so early?

203
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,780
I'm not here early.

204
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,700
Been here all night?

205
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,910
Yeah.

206
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,490
What are you working on?

207
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,080
Nothing right now.

208
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,580
I'm just stealing some software from Adobe and Microsoft.

209
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,210
You're gonna get caught one day.

210
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Hey, Mel!

211
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,010
Don't tell anybody or I'd have to kill you.

212
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,010
What the hell is this?

213
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,400
Wow!

214
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Melany, come look at his!

215
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,080
Looks like someone's trying corrupt the Internet.

216
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,880
Yeah, but it hasn't start propagating yet.

217
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,000
They're just placing the nodes.

218
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Look at this!

219
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,590
This thing could tank every system in the world!

220
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,890
You've gotta tell somebody.

221
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,300
If I call the Feds from here,

222
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,600
they'll trace the call, they'll know I was stealing code.

223
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,100
Then do it from a payphone.

224
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,900
Yeah.

225
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,910
No, I'm up to speed on the train bombing.

226
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,290
How many confirmed dead?

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,210
I didn't know that.

228
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,210
I will. Thanks, Sal.

229
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,580
32 dead.

230
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,210
What's the initial assessment?

231
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,710
An act of terrorism.

232
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,300
When you get to CTU, I want you to find out all the details and call me.

233
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,800
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,800
And listen,

235
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,680
I don't want anyone except the two of you to know about this meeting with Richard.

236
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,600
Of course.

237
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,400
I tried to get a hold of you last night. Where were you?

238
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,110
I had dinner with a friend.

239
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,820
Anyone I know?

240
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,690
No.

241
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,200
- Jack.  - Sir.

242
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,410
I'll call you when I get to CTU.

243
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,220
Yeah, I'll get it. Hold on.

244
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,890
O'Brian.

245
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,300
Chlo? it's Edgar Stiles.

246
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,890
Edgar, you don't need to use your last name. You've been here over a month.

247
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,020
- What is it?  - Okay...

248
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,390
I've got someone on the other line who says he's a friend of yours and needs to talk to you.

249
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,600
- Who, Edgar?  - His name is Andrew Page.

250
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,610
- Fine. Put him through.  - Okay.

251
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,400
Hello?

252
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,690
Andrew, you know I can't take personal calls here.

253
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,990
It's not personal.

254
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,700
I found something on the net I think you should know about.

255
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,910
What?

256
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,910
There's a fake NAT table and several large burped routers.

257
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,290
It was loaded this morning.

258
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,410
How would you know that?

259
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,790
I was trying to download some software and I noticed it.

260
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,000
And by download I assume you mean steal. Otherwise you wouldn't even see the NAT table.

261
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,380
Okay, fine. But I hacked deeper and I found all kinds of stuff.

262
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,800
What kind of stuff?

263
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,680
I think someone's positioning code for a major Internet attack.

264
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,310
The thing is that not all the code remarks are in English.

265
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,890
What language were they in?

266
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,900
I don't know.

267
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,110
Looked Middle Eastern. Like Arabic or Turkish maybe.

268
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,990
You find something?

269
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,700
Yeah, Cyril's working on the list of known contacts of Sharek.

270
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,780
The system flagged Maris Landstraf. He owns a drycleaners in Studio City.

271
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,200
We dug into the records and found his business is owned

272
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,290
by an holding company based out of Ankara, Turkey.

273
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Alright.

274
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,500
Give this to Ronnie, tell him to get over there and see what he can find.

275
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,010
Excuse me, Mrs. Driscoll.

276
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,300
What is it, Chlo?

277
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,800
I just got a call from an old classmate, Andrew Page.

278
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,300
He noticed that a number of high-profile Internet nodes were compromised.

279
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,680
I think this could be related to our present threat.

280
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,890
What makes you say that?

281
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,900
A computer network virus was launched this morning from a server somewhere in Turkey.

282
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,610
That's where Sharek is from?

283
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,110
Should I start working it up?

284
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,480
No.

285
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,400
The bombing and Sharek are all we should be dealing with now.

286
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,110
But pass it to the FBI.

287
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,690
Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?

288
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,110
Yes, I have a scheduled meeting with Erin Driscoll.

289
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,900
Jack!

290
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,910
It's okay, Sarah. This is Jack Bauer.

291
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,700
Oh! M. Bauer.

292
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,700
- I'm sorry.  - No, that's fine.

293
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,580
Chlo? How have you been?

294
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,710
Not perfect but okay, I guess. How are Kim and Chase?

295
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,580
Good.

296
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,290
They just got a house in Valencia.

297
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,300
Kim is taking care of Angela.

298
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Chase is working for a private security company.

299
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,380
That's interesting.

300
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,390
I mean, I'm interested, I just have to set up a protocol.

301
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,010
Yeah...

302
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,810
Jack.

303
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,310
Curtis!

304
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,190
- Is Erin ready for our meeting?  - Almost.

305
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,980
But I should tell you, you're probably gonna get cut short today.

306
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,690
The train bombing in Santa Clarita.

307
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,990
Among other things.

308
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
What other things?

309
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,990
I wouldn't worry with it.

310
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,110
We're out.

311
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Okay, we'll have you in voice 3, data 4.

312
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,290
- Alright.  - Ronnie, this is Jack Bauer.

313
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,490
Jack, Ronnie Mabel.

314
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,080
- Nice to meet you.  - Hey, Jack.

315
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,420
Ronnie's got your old job, head of field ops.

316
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,880
Yeah, I know. How's it going?

317
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,000
It's busy. Nice meeting you.

318
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,880
Look, would you rather reschedule this?

319
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,010
No, it won't be necessary.

320
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,680
Erin will be free in a couple minutes.

321
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,590
I'll tell you what.

322
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,600
Why don't you use the station?

323
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,800
Make any calls.

324
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,310
- It won't be long.  - Okay. Thank you.

325
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,710
I don't know, Max. Let me find out.

326
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm on with a representant from Vandemburg.

327
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,210
He wants to know how long he'll be pushed back today.

328
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,800
Don't change anything with Vandemburg.

329
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,890
We'll stick to the original schedule.

330
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,800
Okay, Max, yeah. We'll see you then.

331
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,310
Have you spoken with your brother?

332
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,310
No, I don't think he even knows I'm coming with you today.

333
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,980
That's probably best that he doesn't.

334
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,900
Alright, I'll stay in the car.

335
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,400
Dad, look...

336
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,700
even if Richard does go to this protest. It's not the end of the world.

337
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,910
It's not a page 1 story.

338
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,790
That's not the point. It's an embarassment to me and to the President.

339
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,090
What are you gonna say to him?

340
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,590
I have no idea.

341
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,210
The thing that gets to me

342
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,800
is that he doesn't know the first thing about the politics of all this.

343
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,010
He's just doing it to rebel against you.

344
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,680
When did I become the enemy?

345
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,390
- What did I do?  - Nothing!

346
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,180
Richard's acting like a spoiled child. He's gonna have to grow up some day.

347
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,900
Audrey Raines.

348
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,480
The President is calling for Secretary Heller.

349
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,400
Yeah.

350
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,990
It's the President's office.

351
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,200
Hello here.

352
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,700
Please hold for the President.

353
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,790
- James.  - Yes, Mr. President.

354
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,580
James, I'm thinking about raising the terror alert level.

355
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,290
Because of the train bombing out here?

356
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,210
No, not just that.

357
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,300
Langley has picked up some chatter.

358
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,300
We also have intel on some watchlisted individuals who've gotten into the country.

359
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,890
Well, my instinct is to wait until the NTSP waves in on the bombing.

360
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,310
In the meantime, we can increase our state of readiness.

361
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,890
Alright, I'll take that into consideration.

362
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,190
I'm meeting with the Secretary of State and director Shay in a few minutes.

363
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,690
I'll see if they feel the same about it.

364
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,490
Yes, Mr. President.

365
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,990
Thank you.

366
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,410
Hello, Erin.

367
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,080
Hello, Jack.

368
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm sorry Secretary Heller couldn't be here today.

369
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,790
It's just as well.

370
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,090
As I'm sure you were told, we have a protocol in progress.

371
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,090
So, why don't we just go down the items and get it over with?

372
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,510
That's fine with me.

373
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,810
I'll be direct with you, Jack.

374
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,890
I didn't like the budget your boss proposed.

375
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,900
What's the problem?

376
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,190
Well, the Department of Defence is asking for 85% of all inter-agency moneys

377
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
which is very little for CTU.

378
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,280
If you want a bigger piece of the pie, you're gonna have to justify it.

379
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,280
I have a proposal for you.

380
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,500
You want to use satellite surveillance for all the traffic at the harbor?

381
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,710
Yes. Problem?

382
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,800
Yes, it's insufficient.

383
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,590
You need to maintain bodies on the ground.

384
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Too expensive.

385
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,300
Not if you utilize intelligence from the other agencies.

386
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,510
Look, I'm not gonna have Secretary Heller sign off on a budget that doesn't make sense.

387
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,180
I'll talk to Heller about it myself.

388
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,100
No, you'll talk to me.

389
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,900
We're not doing this twice.

390
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,400
Erin, Ronnie has arrived at Landshaff's dry cleaners.

391
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,780
Where's the feed?

392
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,280
It'll be on channel one as soon as he sets the hidden camera.

393
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,780
Excuse me, Jack.

394
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,800
Okay, here we go.

395
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,010
Stand down until I give you order.

396
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,680
Aaron, go round the back.

397
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,090
Sean, you go take the side.

398
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,280
Hello?

399
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Can I help you?

400
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,280
You must be Mr. Landstraf.

401
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,410
Do I know you?

402
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,910
My name is Ronnie Labell. I'm with Los Angeles CTU.

403
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,410
I need to ask you a few questions.

404
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,710
What do you know about a man named Thomas Sharek?

405
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,880
I don't know this man.

406
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,500
Really?

407
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,220
It's in your records that you contacted him in the last few days.

408
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,380
It wasn't me.

409
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,380
I run a legitimate business here.

410
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,890
I never said you business wasn't legitimate, sir.

411
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,600
You can't just walk in here and harrass me.

412
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,100
He's hiding something.

413
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,310
It's beeing handled, Jack.

414
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Erin, listen to me.

415
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,400
This store is open for business but the blinds are closed.

416
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,900
There's no other employees.

417
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,110
This guy is way too nervous. Trust me. He's hiding something.

418
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,790
Ronnie，turn back a little momment, please.

419
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,210
Says here you open at 6 A.M. Have you been here the entire time?

420
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,210
Yes.

421
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,210
- What's this about?  - Right there.

422
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,180
- Did you see that?  - Yeah.

423
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,980
Tell him to look for something on his right.

424
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Ronnie.

425
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,190
On his right, see if someone could be hiding.

426
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,610
Do you mind I take a look behind that counter?

427
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,790
Yes, I do mind. Look, this is my store and I want you to walk ou now.

428
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,200
Sir, I'm not walking out of there until I take a look...

429
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,170
Jerk!

430
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,510
Got him!

431
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,390
Great job.

432
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,450
Remember, Dad, we're on a tight schedule today.

433
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,680
Richard.

434
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,560
Dad.

435
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,390
- Hello.  - Hey, it's me.

436
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,770
Hey. Aren't you supposed to be in your meeting with Driscoll?

437
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,270
Yeah. She had to step away.

438
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,530
Listen, CTU's just picked up a prime suspect in the train bombing.

439
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,570
They're bringing him in for questioning now.

440
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,240
My father's still in with Richard.

441
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,820
That's all right. I'll brief him later. I just wanted to let you know.

442
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,580
All right. That's good news.

443
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,500
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

444
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,790
All right...

445
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,790
um, I'll talk to you later.

446
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,250
Wait. Wait.

447
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,130
What is it?

448
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,760
Look, about earlier...

449
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,300
I don't want you to think that that made me uncomfortable.

450
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,550
It's just that since Teri died, I never thought I'd...

451
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,470
Jack, it's all right.

452
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,640
- I understand.  - No. No, you don't.

453
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,230
I just want you to know that...

454
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,110
I'm falling in love with you, too.

455
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,870
Wow. Um, you caught me off guard.

456
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,240
Yeah. Sorry about that.

457
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,120
Look, Driscoll's coming back. I gotta go.

458
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,000
Then go.

459
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,750
Okay. I'll talk to you when I get a break.

460
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,500
All right.

461
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,300
What's happening with the suspect?

462
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,800
Ronnie's bringing him in.

463
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,510
Who is he?

464
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,270
Fortunately, for you, Jack, it's our problem, not yours.

465
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,810
Right.

466
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,860
I'm going, Dad.

467
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,070
And there's nothing you can to do stop me.

468
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,400
How many cars do you need to get places?

469
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,400
I didn't come here to argue about the environment, Richard.

470
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,490
I didn't ask you to come at all.

471
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,540
I do not want you to attend or to speak at that rally at Lockheed this afternoon.

472
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,540
You don't have any leverage over what I do anymore.

473
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,670
You haven't since I stopped taking your money.

474
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,300
Can't you ever think of anything besides yourself?

475
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,840
If you do this,

476
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,840
it will humiliate the President,

477
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,220
and it will be dangerous to national security.

478
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,010
What could be more dangerous

479
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,100
than 2,500 missile delivery systems?

480
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,390
Oh, spare me your sixth-grade Michael Moore logic.

481
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,310
The world is a little bit more complicated than that, Richard.

482
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
We do not live in a utopia.

483
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,690
America has enemies.

484
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,530
Enemies who were our friends a year ago.

485
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,780
And in another year, it'll change again,

486
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,700
unless people stop supporting your psychotic need to control the world.

487
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,580
Psychotic need?!

488
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,670
We serve our country!

489
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,330
We serve the cause of freedom!

490
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,460
What do you do?!

491
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,630
Why don't you just go back to your little motorcade

492
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,680
and drive somewhere where people actually buy the lies you're selling?

493
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,180
Okay, look, look, we don't have to do this, okay? We do not have to.

494
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,810
Fine, Dad. What do you want to do?

495
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,020
Do not disrespect me. I am your father.

496
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,640
Nothing.

497
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,640
It was my friend, not me.

498
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,810
- What's his name?  - Andrew.

499
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,230
- Andrew what?  - Andrew Paige.

500
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,360
Who did you tell?

501
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,480
I swear, we didn't tell anyone. I don't know.

502
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,740
Don't lie to me.

503
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,570
I don't know! He just stumbled on the site and logged out!

504
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,320
Don't lie to me!

505
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,870
Where is Andrew Paige now?

506
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,670
I was just doing my work... I don't...

507
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,350
You can use station five. Chloe's opened up a socket for you.

508
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,230
You'll be able to access the records volume to look at those budget numbers.

509
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,480
Okay, fine.

510
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,900
- I know this guy.  - Who, Sherek?

511
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,530
We were tracking him when I was here.

512
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,870
We knew him as Jann Bolek.

513
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,410
We linked him to over a dozen complicated bombings in Europe in the late '90s.

514
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,830
Unfortunately, we weren't able to stop him from today's attack.

515
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,210
But we did catch him.

516
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,290
And, Jack, I'm sorry I was abrupt before.

517
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,710
You helped us with the takedown. Thank you.

518
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,850
Erin, listen to me.

519
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,850
This doesn't make sense.

520
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,430
I know this guy's file. He's a major handler.

521
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,770
He wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the United States for a train bombing.

522
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,060
It's not big enough.

523
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,110
We'll take that into consideration when we interrogate him.

524
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,530
Give my best to Secretary Heller.

525
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,540
- Chloe.  - What?

526
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,870
The original data that you pulled up on Sherek,

527
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,290
was there any indication of a secondary strike?

528
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,170
No. Everything supports that he was here for the train bombing.

529
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,960
But there was a time discrepancy.

530
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,170
What do you mean?

531
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,550
There was some high-probability chatter indicating an attack at 8:00 a.m.

532
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,090
The train bombing happened at 7:00.

533
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,760
They didn't give a window? They actually called for a specific time?

534
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,930
Yeah, but the intel was off by an hour.

535
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,930
Driscoll thought it was close enough.

536
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,310
You can't do that.

537
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,650
What's your log-on I.D. for Interpol overnights?

538
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,940
I'm not comfortable doing this.

539
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,530
Chloe, please.

540
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
You're in.

541
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,460
Is this the source?

542
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,130
Yes. That's the decipher.

543
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,670
Calls for an 8:00 strike

544
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,550
"...unless target deviates." That doesn't make sense.

545
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,180
Trains don't deviate, they're on a fixed course and schedule.

546
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,510
Sometimes when Interpol's breaking codes and communiques,

547
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
it won't use the exact wording.

548
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,600
What are you thinking, Jack?

549
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,610
Sherek didn't come here for a train bombing.

550
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,730
Something's going to happen at 8:00.

551
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,650
That's ten minutes from now.

552
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,610
No, Paul, I don't want to wait.

553
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,950
I'm going to call my lawyer as soon as we get back to D.C.

554
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,320
and we're going to get this divorce process moving.

555
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,320
Well, what's the hurry?

556
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,030
We said we'd take a year apart and see what happened.

557
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,740
Yeah, but it's almost been a year.

558
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,620
I don't want to wait any longer.

559
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,000
Hang on.

560
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,040
Look, I got to take this call. We'll talk when I back to D.C.

561
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,040
- Yeah, fine.  - All right, bye.

562
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,010
Jack.

563
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,400
Hey, I need to speak with your father.

564
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,870
He's still in with Richard. He doesn't want to be interrupted.

565
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,460
This is urgent. I need him to get me clearance

566
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,890
so I can interrogate the suspect in the train bombing.

567
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,860
Driscoll won't let me anywhere near him.

568
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,290
I believe he's got information about a secondary hit, a larger one.

569
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,470
Supposed to take place this morning at 8:00.

570
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,810
Well, it's almost 8:00 now.

571
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,360
I know, that's why I need to speak with him.

572
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,250
All right, hang on.

573
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,260
I'm going to speak at that rally this afternoon, Dad.

574
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,990
And it's not because I hate you.

575
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,090
It's 'cause it's something I believe in.

576
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,810
Did it ever occur to you that these people are using you?

577
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:30,420
Don't you realize they're letting you speak for one reason and one reason only,

578
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,570
because you are my son!

579
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,790
Well, I wish I weren't.

580
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,460
What is it, Audrey?

581
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,930
I'm sorry, it's Jack. It's urgent.

582
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,400
Excuse me, Richard.

583
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,870
What could be more important than intimidating me?

584
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,360
I didn't know you were hiding in the car.

585
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,790
Richie, why are you doing this to Dad?

586
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,970
- Can't you just back off?  - I'm not doing anything to him.

587
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,190
You know if you go to that protest at Lockheed it's going to hurt him.

588
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,580
Whatever it takes to stop what he's doing.

589
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,900
Jack, if I step on Driscoll's toes and it doesn't pay off,

590
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,700
all of a sudden, I have ton of political fallout to deal with.

591
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,830
Sir, I understand that.

592
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,680
But I wouldn't be asking you this if I didn't believe

593
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,900
there was an imminent threat to national security that I could help avert.

594
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,830
Share your concerns with Driscoll.

595
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,890
- Let CTU handle it.  - Sir, there isn't time.

596
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,310
It's the President.

597
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,450
Jack, it's the President. I've got to go.

598
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,460
Yes, sir.

599
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,020
Damn.

600
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,870
How long you been in Los Angeles?

601
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,300
Who are you working with?

602
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,990
We don't have time for this.

603
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,710
Okay, you listen to me.

604
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,970
Unless you start giving me some answers right now,

605
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,190
you're going to end up in a hole for the next 30 years.

606
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,920
Who are you working with?!

607
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,530
Why did you bomb that train?!

608
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,940
How far can I push this guy?

609
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,790
We have to find out who he's working with.

610
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,460
Should go as far as we have to.

611
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,260
Maybe we should bring Johnson in.

612
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,000
Sorry, sir, this area's off-limits.

613
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,520
Oh, I'm looking for Erin Driscoll.

614
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:13,970
Jack!

615
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,560
Jack, what are you doing?

616
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,610
Call security now.

617
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,990
What is happening at 8:00?

618
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,710
Son of a bitch, he's jammed the codes.

619
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,930
I am not messing with you.

620
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,320
You are going to tell me... what is happening at 8:00?!

621
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,830
Jack, holster your weapon!

622
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:28,970
Jack!

623
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,770
I said holster your weapon!

624
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,620
Call Medical.

625
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,090
What is your primary objective?!

626
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,310
I'll order security to shoot you if I have to.

627
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,230
Get that door open.

628
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,910
What is your primary objective?!

629
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,210
Secretary of Defense!

630
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,230
Heller.

631
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,000
- Secretary Heller?  - Yes.

632
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,380
Secretary Heller's the target.

633
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,050
Call Secret Service now.

634
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,060
Call now. Get a team on the way.

635
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,920
Yeah, I'll hold.

636
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,100
The President wants us back in D.C. tonight.

637
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,620
What meetings can we eject?

638
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,890
Not Vandenberg. The media's expecting you there.

639
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,810
Maybe we skip Paradigm,

640
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,910
and handle that with a teleconference next week.

641
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,680
Come on, pick up the phone!

642
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,610
Tell the President we'll we rearrange our schedule

643
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,120
and fly back this afternoon.

644
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,620
Yeah.

645
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,800
Audrey, it's Jack.

646
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,510
- Are you still at Richard's?  - Yeah.

647
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,230
You need to get your father out of there now!

648
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,160
The bombing this morning was diversory!

649
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,340
Your father is the real target! You've got to get out of there now!

650
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,850
- Target?!  - Audrey!

651
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,650
Oh, my God.

652
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,740
Audrey!

653
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,480
On your feet!

654
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,300
Jack! No!

655
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,550
Jack!

656
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,640
Audrey!

657
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,360
Jack!

658
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,170
Let her go!

659
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,140
Where we going?!

660
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


661
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,770
The Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors.

2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,370
I'm going to have to manage the override personally,

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,540
make sure those six meltdown on schedule.

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,890
Is there anything I can do?

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,600
Take care of your mess.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,750
I give you my word,

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,800
my wife and son will be dead by the end of this day.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm not afraid of Father.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,160
You should be.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,190
He tried to kill me and then he did this to you.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,690
You're going to need to set things up on your end.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,930
All right, what do I do?

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,070
Divert suspicion.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,490
Someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,170
Ms. Driscoll, what's going on?

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,470
You're under arrest, Gavin.

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,720
For what?

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,270
Passing classified information.

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,110
Thousands of people's lives are at stake.

20
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,710
Where are the people who control the override?

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,440
I swear, I don't know anything.

22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,610
Yeah?

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,800
We've got a match, Jack.

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,460
His name is Henry Powell.

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,010
He's a computer consultant, that used to work for McLennen-Forster.

26
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,160
They're the defense contractors that designed the override devices controlling the power plants.

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,650
You're going to fly me out of here.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,180
Drop the weapon now! Now!

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,980
Put him in the back.

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,420
He's dead, Jack.

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,940
Damn it!

32
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,890
You've got the wrong person.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,370
Sarah's not guilty of anything.

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,170
It's Maryanne Taylor.

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,240
You're under arrest.

36
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,030
Excuse me, Curtis.

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,200
Not now.

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,900
Coordinate that with NRC and copy me on 6-0-B. Bye.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I warned you about her.

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,900
Maryanne Taylor.

42
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
I told you she was trouble and it was a mistake to let her work here.

43
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,300
No.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,900
You told me that you weren't comfortable working with her.

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
You didn't tell me you were having a relationship with a corporate spy.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,600
How could I have possibly known that, Erin?

47
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,200
Don't play that card with me.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,500
Fine, then don't walk in here

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,200
with an I-told-you-so attitude.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Because now we both have to deal with this.

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,500
You mean division?

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,200
That's right.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
They're going to want a complete timeline.

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,200
Everything from how Maryanne got through the front door, down to the high-security files

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,300
that she was able to access in a very short period of time.

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,100
Can we have a conversation off book?

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,500
Go ahead.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,200
There's no point in either of us compromising our authority in the eyes of division.

59
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,300
Agree or disagree?

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,300
Agreed.

61
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,300
Maryanne did an excellent job in establishing her credentials.

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,400
All we need to do is leave out some of the details in how she managed to leverage her way in here.

63
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,400
I don't like anyone holding something over me.

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,500
Neither do I.

65
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,400
How long will it take you to adjust the files?

66
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Two minutes.

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll call division at 5:00.

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,200
Explain to me how this mole-Maryanne Taylor- was able to infiltrate CTU.

69
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,300
We're still investigating, Mr. President.

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,300
Who does she work for?

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,100
We don't know.

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Find out.

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,400
We will, as soon as she regains consciousness.

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,300
She's being treated here in the clinic.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Treated for what?

76
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
An attempt on her life.

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,800
Who tried to kill her?

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
We don't know that either.

79
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,500
But whoever it was, they're more than likely connected with the theft of the override.

80
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,500
Jim, we need to find that override now.

81
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,400
What's the latest from the NRC?

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,300
They just reported the San Gabriel Island reactor is about to go critical.

83
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
What's the timeframe?

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,500
A meltdown within the hour.

85
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,300
We started evacuating the San Gabriel zone.

86
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
The population affected is less than 100,000.

87
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,400
Hopefully most of them are already on the move.

88
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,100
All right.

89
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,200
Expedite the process as much as you can.

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, sir.

91
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,300
Jack?

92
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,800
Erin, Powell's dead.

93
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,100
He was hit by a sniper as soon as we took him into custody.

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,800
Get anything from him before he was killed?

95
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,000
No, but I managed to get the last ten calls he made off his cell phone.

96
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,800
He called two numbers repeatedly. Through caller ID,

97
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,400
we traced one of them to Maryanne Taylor.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Powell was working with Maryanne?

99
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,400
Apparently.

100
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
What about this other number?

101
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,700
Hold on. I'm going to need you

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,000
to trace it through CTU.

103
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Okay, go ahead.

104
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,200
818-555-0539.

105
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
I'll get back to you as soon as I've got an ID.

106
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
I'll be standing by.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,900
Edgar, I need you to run a locate on this number.

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,700
It's a cellular account.

109
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,700
Can you trace the location?

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
I need to ping the number. How?

111
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,100
It needs to ring at least four times

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,000
before I can triangulate the coordinates.

113
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,800
Jameson can have me set up in a couple of minutes.

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,400
Who is it?

115
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,000
Navi.

116
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,400
Navi?

117
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,800
I'm looking for Dina.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
Well, Dina's not here. Why would she be?

120
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,200
She hasn't called you in the last hour?

121
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,100
No.

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,900
What's going on, Navi?

123
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,600
Why are you blocking the door?

124
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,700
I'm not.

125
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,100
Let me in.

126
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
I told you, she's not here.

127
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,100
You're lying.

128
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,900
You're hiding her.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,500
No, I'm not.

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,300
Navi, no.

131
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,600
You have no right to come in here like this!

132
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,100
She is not here.

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,700
Go.

134
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,300
Look.

135
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,300
That is my bedroom.

136
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
You can't go in there.

137
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,900
What the hell is going on here?

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,300
Nothing, it's okay.

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,700
Navi, please.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,700
Please, go.

141
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,900
Look, pal, this is none of your business, all right?

142
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,300
So why don't you hike it on out of here? Please, don't interfere.

143
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
You can either walk out of here

144
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
or I'm going to throw you out.

145
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,700
I said, go!

146
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,100
No, Navi, please, no.

147
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,500
Navi, don't, please.

148
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,300
Get back inside.

149
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,400
Navi.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,100
Don't tell my husband. I beg of you.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You disgust me.

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Navi.

153
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,500
Dina's not here.

154
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,600
What about the hospitals?

155
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,800
Nothing so far.

156
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,500
Keep looking.

157
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,400
Is it your father?

158
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,800
I can't tell.

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,100
Don't answer it.

160
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,500
We got it.

161
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,100
Where?

162
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
A hotel in Chatsworth.

163
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
Download the coordinates to Jack's PDA.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,100
Here's our backup.

165
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,200
Yeah.

166
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,800
We traced the call to a fixed location. We're sending it to you now.

167
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,700
Hold on a second.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Okay, I got it. We're less than ten minutes out.

169
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,400
I'll have a tactical team in place by the time you get there.

170
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you.

171
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,200
The body is over there by my car.

172
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,100
He was taken out by a sniper from the north roof.

173
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,700
I want you to take your photographs and get the body back to CTU as fast as possible.

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
Come on, Tony, we've got to go.

175
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,300
Wait, Jack.

176
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,500
Look, uh, I think I'm done here today.

177
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,800
What are you talking about?

178
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,300
CTU backup's here. You don't need me anymore.

179
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,100
I need you to see this through with me.

180
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
I appreciate the sentiment, Jack, but you don't have to prop up my ego.

181
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,000
Tony, this isn't about you.

182
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,400
If we don't find the override device within an hour, we're going to have six major nuclear disasters.

183
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,200
So please, get in the car. Let's go.

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,900
Mom, we've got to get you some help.

185
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm okay.

186
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,500
This is my fault.

188
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Your father shot me, not you.

189
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,500
Because you were trying to stop him from killing me.

190
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,100
Everything that's happening today,

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,100
what we've all been fighting to achieve,

192
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,400
it's more important to him than anything or anyone.

193
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,500
But not to you.

194
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,000
Mom?

195
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
I need to get you something for the pain.

196
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,700
I'll be fine.

197
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,600
I just need to rest.

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,000
I can get it from Nasim.

199
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,800
No.

200
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,000
The hospital he works at is right near here.

201
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,300
I'll be right back.

202
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,200
Nasim doesn't know why

203
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,600
we were really living here.

204
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,100
Mom, he's your brother.

205
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,600
I'll tell him you need it and nothing else.

206
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
I promise. I'll be right back.

207
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,700
Just hurry.

208
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,800
I will.

209
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,300
Mr. Secretary, we have a meltdown.

210
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,200
The San Gabriel Island reactor has just gone critical.

211
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,900
The core material is now airborne.

212
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,800
I thought we had more time.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,100
Ms. Driscoll, I have Derrick Ross with the engineer at San Gabriel Island on with the NRC.

214
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,000
One of their generators exploded, it cooked their com lines, so the feed is unstable.

215
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
We may only have a few seconds.

216
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,700
Patch us in.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,800
What's going on?

218
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
We've had a meltdown on San Gabriel Island.

219
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
All attempts to contain the core have failed.

220
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,300
Right now my men are trying to bypass the reactor trip, but that's not working either.

221
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,900
Mr. Rosner, this is Erin Driscoll from CTU.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,800
Can you hear me?

223
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Yes, ma'am, I can.

224
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm here with Secretary of Defense James Heller.

225
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,400
What are your radiation levels?

226
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,400
We're at 500 rem right now.

227
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,200
That's 10,000 times the dose of an X ray.

228
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,100
At this rem rate, the radiation will continue getting stronger and will spill into the atmosphere until the core has exhausted itself.

229
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,300
Son, you've done everything you can, now get the hell out of there.

230
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,700
Evacuating won't make any difference, sir.

231
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,100
We've already been exposed.

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We lost them.

233
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,100
Have we analyzed the radiation cloud's movement?

234
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,700
We're still waiting for NGS to get a weather satellite for us.

235
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,900
Get on the phone and have them expedite it.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,700
I will, as soon as I'm done rerouting these evacuation instructions.

237
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,300
Can't someone else do that?

238
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,700
No, sir, I'm short of manpower.

239
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,600
A government spokesman has just confirmed that the nuclear reactor at San Gabriel Island is in full meltdown.

240
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Emergency personnel are on site attempting to rescue workers exposed to radiation.

241
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,600
Several people have been taken...

242
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,700
You're not listening to me.

243
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,000
I've been trying to get through to a number in the San Gabriel evacuation zone for ten minutes.

244
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,900
I need you to link me in to access the emergency bandwidth, and I need you to do it now.

245
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,400
All right, standby.

246
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,000
Thank you.

247
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,600
If you are on the road or awaiting instructions...

248
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
...here are some items you and your family might need.

249
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,200
Hello?

250
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,800
Mom.

251
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,500
Oh, hello, Edgar.

252
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Have you seen the news?

253
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
Yes, I'm watching it now.

254
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,500
Then why haven't you evacuated by now?

255
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,800
What are you still doing home?

256
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,400
You know I don't have a car.

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Where's Margaret?

258
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Well, I've tried to get hold of her, but the lines are all busy. I'm surprised you got through.

259
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
What about one of your neighbors? Can't you get a ride from one of them?

260
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,800
No. By the time I got outside they were all gone.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Mom, listen to me.

262
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,300
I'm going to make some calls.

263
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm going to get someone there to help you, okay?

264
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,900
I want you to sit by the phone and wait for my call.

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,900
Can you do that?

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Yes, I don't really have a choice.

267
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,500
I'll call you back, okay?

268
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,400
Okay, honey.

269
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,000
Bye.

270
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,100
No, we delegated that whole situation to Murphy's group, sir.

271
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,900
I'm not interested in who got it wrong.

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We don't have the luxury of miscommunications.

273
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm assigning someone from my office to coordinate between the State Police and the National Guard.

274
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,600
Set up the conference call in ten minutes.

275
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,600
Thank you all.

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Are you okay?

277
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah. How are you holding up?

278
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,200
Considering the situation we're in...

279
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm doing fine.

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The truth of the matter is,

281
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,200
we do not have the manpower to handle this mess.

282
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,500
Tell me what I can do.

283
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,900
I've prioritized evacuation protocol,

284
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,400
but I need someone to keep the State Police and the National Guard from bumping in to each other.

285
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,300
All right.

286
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,500
I'll stop the Guard at the 75th mile marker and let the police take over from there.

287
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,800
That'll maximize room for civilian traffic.

288
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,000
I wish we had some other way to get those people out of there.

289
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
There's nowhere else to route them.

290
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,500
Jack has got to find the override before the rest of these reactors go critical.

291
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,900
Hey, Jack.

292
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,900
Good to have you in the field again.

293
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,800
Thanks, Lee. You remember Tony Almeida?

294
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Yeah.

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,500
I don't know what he's doing here, though.

296
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,400
I want him here.

297
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,800
LEE: He's not authorized to be in the field.

298
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,900
I'm going through that door first.

299
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,100
I want him there

300
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
to back me up.

301
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,100
Fine.

302
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,300
Get another vest.

303
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,100
You got a visual on the suspect?

304
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
We've got a fiber optic camera inside the room.

305
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,700
According to the manager, we're grabbing a mid-40s female and a teenage male.

306
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,400
Possibly mother and son, both Middle-Eastern.

307
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,100
Okay, we need the suspects alive.

308
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,900
They're no good to us dead.

309
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've been briefed.

310
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,800
Let's go.

311
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,600
Agent Castle, we've got a visual on the woman.

312
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,800
What about the kid?

313
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,000
I haven't seen him yet.

314
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,500
We got to go, now.

315
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,800
You ready?

316
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,000
Go.

317
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,300
Don't move!

318
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Drop the weapon!

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,200
Where is the override?

320
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,600
Tell me who's got it!

321
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,700
Tell me!

322
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,500
Now!

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,700
Agent Castle!

324
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,700
Agent Castle, stand down!

325
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,700
Agent Castle, please stand down!

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,900
Get off her!

327
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
We've got to get her to talk.

328
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,300
She's going to go into shock before she does.

329
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,100
Just relax!

330
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
Agent Castle, step outside now!

331
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,400
I want her prints and photographs. Send them over to CTU immediately.

332
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
He has no right to give me orders.

333
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,100
Hey, come here.

334
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,600
He did the right thing.

335
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,600
That woman was willing to kill herself.

336
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,900
She'd die before she gave us anything through force.

337
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
We need to get her to talk before the other reactors go critical.

338
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,100
And we will.

339
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,700
What did you have in mind?

340
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,800
We need to find some leverage.

341
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,300
CTU, Barnes.

342
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,200
Yeah, it's Jack.

343
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,100
Put me through to Erin.

344
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,600
Come here.

345
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,800
Come here.

346
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,900
Let me see your arm.

347
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,800
Driscoll.

348
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,000
Erin, we've got a suspect.

349
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sending you fingerprints and photographs.

350
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,600
I need you to run a profile and send me all relevant databases and electronic communications.

351
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,200
Got it.

352
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,800
Thank you.

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,500
Hey, I understand your concerns about Almeida, but for me, please, just give him a break.

354
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,500
Okay, Jack.

355
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Jack!

356
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,700
Thanks.

357
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,300
Yeah?

358
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,500
This is a bullet wound.

359
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,000
Probably a couple hours old.

360
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,000
As the evacuation appears now to be in full swing with major delays on all routes...

361
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Excuse me.

362
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,900
A nuclear emergency team has just emerged from the plant.

363
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,400
Uh, we can see them here on our Sky-Cam.

364
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,900
They seem to be going through some kind of decontamination...

365
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,300
Behrooz.

366
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,300
Uncle Nasim.

367
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,100
Are you all right?

368
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah, I think so.

369
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,800
Yeah, it's a disaster what's happening today.

370
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,100
Everyone's panicked about radiation poisoning.

371
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,800
They all want iodine pills and we're almost out.

372
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,500
Is that why you're here?

373
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,100
No.

374
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,300
I need pain medication.

375
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,400
It's for my mother.

376
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,700
She couldn't reach her doctor by phone,

377
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,200
so she wanted me to get it from you.

378
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,100
What's wrong with her?

379
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
It's her back. She can barely walk.

380
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,300
She needs a prescription.

381
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,100
I told you.

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,100
She couldn't reach her doctor.

383
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll see what I can do, okay?

384
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,800
Just have a seat.

385
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,400
Yes?

386
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,400
Navi, it's Nasim.

387
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,000
Hello, Nasim, how are you?

388
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm well, but Behrooz just showed up at the hospital.

389
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,700
He seems disturbed.

390
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,100
Is Dina there too?

391
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
No, he says he needs pain medication for her.

392
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,700
That there's something wrong with her back, but he's acting very strange.

393
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,400
I'm sorry you have to be involved in this, Nasim.

394
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,600
Involved in what? What's going on?

395
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,200
Behrooz may be taking drugs.

396
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,300
He's been getting worse.

397
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,800
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Me, too.

399
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
What do you want me to do?

400
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,000
Keep Behrooz there until I can come for him.

401
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,100
How long will you be?

402
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
15 minutes.

403
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,800
I'll do my best, but...

404
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,600
Please, Nasim, don't let him leave until I get there.

405
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,000
...congestion, the government is asking people to remain calm and exit in a quick and safe manner.

406
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,800
Excuse me, Miss Raines.

407
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,900
I'm Edgar Stiles. Sorry.

408
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,900
We've got a major noncompliance problem.

409
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,900
I've got 25% of the evacuees who aren't going where they're being told to go, and another 25% that don't even know that they're in the evac zone.

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
However you need to do it, make sure it gets done.

411
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm sorry, what is it?

412
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,900
It's my mother.

413
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,900
Your mother?

414
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,400
She lives near San Gabriel Island.

415
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,100
She's in a wheelchair. She doesn't drive. She missed her call to evacuate. Now I don't know what to do.

416
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Maybe someone from the National Guard can get her.

417
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
I already spoke to the area commander.

418
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,800
He said he couldn't spare anyone.

419
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what I can do.

420
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,100
Here's his number.

421
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,580
I thought maybe if you called him yourself.

422
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,520
Look, I hate asking for special treatment. That's not something I would normally do,

423
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,470
but she's my mother.

424
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,270
I can't make any promises.

425
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,360
Just promise me you'll try, okay?

426
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,520
All right.

427
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,810
I want you to give her something for the pain, but make sure she stays lucid.

428
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,430
Understand?

429
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,260
Did you find out who she is yet?

430
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,890
Yeah.

431
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,550
Her name is Dina Araz. She immigrated

432
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,410
to the United States five years ago, became a citizen two years ago.

433
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,350
Married to a Navi Araz. He's also a naturalized citizen.

434
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,150
Owns an electronics store in Carson.

435
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,020
They have one son, Behrooz, 17, a junior

436
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,830
at the local high school. None of them have criminal records.

437
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,690
They pop up on any watch lists?

438
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,310
No, they must have slipped under the radar.

439
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,310
Let's send some teams over to the house and the store, see what we can find.

440
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:36,510
Yeah?

441
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,790
Jack, it's Driscoll.

442
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,510
- Homeland Security has...  - Hold on, Erin.

443
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,780
I can barely hear you.

444
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,360
Go ahead.

445
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,460
After the attack this morning, Homeland Security has been archiving select communications in the L.A. area.

446
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,260
They pulled up a call that may explain how Dina Araz got shot.

447
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,930
Erin, I'm going to put you on speaker phone. Hold on a second.

448
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:55,960
You're on.

449
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,110
This conversation happened about two hours ago between the mother and the son.

450
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,180
He wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie.

451
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,960
Behrooz, that's not possible.

452
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,580
Your father would never want to hurt you.

453
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,610
It's true.

454
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,490
Tariq told me everything.

455
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,850
He was lying.

456
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,120
No, he wasn't.

457
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,170
Mom, I don't know what to do. You have to help me.

458
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,420
Where are you now?

459
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,950
I'm near the Metrolink station on Lassen in Chatsworth.

460
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,620
Are you using Tariq's car?

461
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,240
Yes.

462
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,120
Hide it.

463
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,870
I'll pick you up there in a half hour.

464
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,210
Hurry.

465
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,580
That's it.

466
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,950
Let me know the minute you get something from her.

467
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,470
Yeah.

468
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,880
We got our leverage.

469
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,550
JACK: Lee.

470
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,070
How long have you been planning this operation?

471
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,730
Two years?

472
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,090
Five years?

473
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,950
Ten?

474
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,800
All this planning for one day.

475
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,190
You do realize if all the reactors melt down,

476
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,390
hundreds of thousands of people will die.

477
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,740
Every war has casualties.

478
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,830
These people don't know about your war.

479
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,110
These people are innocent.

480
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,920
No one is innocent.

481
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,340
You really believe that?

482
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,900
As strongly as you believe in what you believe.

483
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:18,030
But I won't waste your time or mine, trying to explain something you can never understand.

484
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,380
Maybe I understand more than you think.

485
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,660
I doubt it.

486
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,820
I know that something happened today to challenge your commitment to your war.

487
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,140
You weren't willing to let your son become a casualty.

488
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,470
That's why you were shot.

489
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,360
Protecting him from his father.

490
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,540
I understand that.

491
00:25:52,350 --> 00:26:00,720
I know what it's like to watch your child be threatened and feel helpless to do anything about it.

492
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,780
Right now Behrooz is out there alone...

493
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,710
and you and I know he's not gonna last very long.

494
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,840
His father will find him...

495
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,760
...and kill him.

496
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,920
There is another option.

497
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,790
If you were to help us find the override device...

498
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,560
we will protect your son.

499
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,360
So he can spend the rest of his life in prison?

500
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,770
No, so he can walk away from all of this, immune from prosecution.

501
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,290
How?

502
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,400
Mrs. Araz, your son is a minor.

503
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,170
He's 17 years old.

504
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,180
I can get him a legal and binding pardon signed by the president of the United States.

505
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,150
You don't have the authority to do this.

506
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,180
I can reach the president.

507
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,340
If you provide us with the information that allows us to find the override device- in time-

508
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,550
I am confident that the president will sign that pardon.

509
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,180
and this offer expires the second another reactor melts down. Do you understand me?

510
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,250
You don't have a lot of time. I would think about this.

511
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,250
Show me this document.

512
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,930
And I'll help you find what you want.

513
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,680
Can we rule out this boy's involvement with the terrorist action?

514
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,460
No, sir.

515
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,460
It's likely he knew of his parents' plans. He probably helped them.

516
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,680
Jack, you're asking me to grant clemency to a terrorist.

517
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,320
Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I don't think we have a choice.

518
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,510
In all of my professional experience, I believe that we have to give in to this woman's demands.

519
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,840
Have you tried negotiating with her?

520
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,090
We don't have time.

521
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,670
In approximately two hours, five nuclear reactors are gonna go critical unless we find the override device.

522
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,890
She is our only link.

523
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,900
Well, I'm uncomfortable with this, but I trust your judgment.

524
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,950
I'll release the letter.

525
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,090
Thank you, Mr. President.

526
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,340
Make sure that document is non-binding.

527
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,800
Yes, I understand.

528
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,940
I'll get back to you on the redeployment figures.

529
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,190
Miss Raines?

530
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,770
Did you talk to them?

531
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes.

532
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,780
Edgar, I'm sorry. They can't get your mother.

533
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,720
Why not? They're five miles off the highway. It wouldn't take that much time.

534
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,020
They know where she is.

535
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,830
Then what's the problem? Thousands of people

536
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,100
are stuck on the Interstate in traffic.

537
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,450
It's taking the combined efforts of the police and the National Guard to get them moving.

538
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,860
So who cares about one old woman.

539
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,560
They've got to throw their resources into saving the maximum number of lives.

540
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,600
If my mother were rich or a politician, they'd find a way to save her.

541
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,340
Field Communications Desk.

542
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,100
This is Edgar Stiles. I need another switching station for that number.

543
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,910
Do you need it again?

544
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,080
No, I've got it logged. Hold the line.

545
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,690
Thank you.

546
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,290
Go ahead, please.

547
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,320
Mom.

548
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,550
Hello, honey.

549
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,990
Mom, I've been trying everything. I can't get anyone out there to help you.

550
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,640
I've done everything I could. I did.

551
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,430
I'm sure you did, honey.

552
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,900
It's okay.

553
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,920
It's not okay.

554
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,840
The fallout's coming toward you. It's 15 miles away.

555
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,930
I know.

556
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,640
I'm watching it on the news and...

557
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,190
I know what to do.

558
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,950
Ma, there's nothing you can do.

559
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,140
You can't stuff towels under the door.

560
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,580
That's not what I'm talking about doing, Edgar.

561
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,630
What do you mean?

562
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,120
They've been talking about radiation poisoning on the news.

563
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,200
That's not something I want to go through,

564
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,600
especially since there's only one way it can end.

565
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,210
Honey,

566
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:24,860
I want to end things on my terms as opposed to all that pain and suffering.

567
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,980
Mom.

568
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,380
It's the right thing to do.

569
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,430
- It's the only thing- you know that.  - No, I don't.

570
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,200
You have been a wonderful son, Edgar.

571
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,110
You've been a gift to me and your father.

572
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,120
It's okay.

573
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,940
I'm going to a better place, and...

574
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,500
I'll see you there,

575
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,220
but not for a long time. You've got a lot ahead of you. Great things.

576
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,670
Maybe I can get someone to you. I'll keep trying.

577
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,310
You've got a very important job to do there.

578
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,700
A lot of people are counting on you.

579
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,300
So...

580
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,750
I'm going to hang up now,

581
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,460
and I want you to know how very, very much I love you.

582
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,700
Mom.

583
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,680
Ma?

584
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,060
Edgar, where are you going?

585
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,420
Edgar!

586
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,950
I have to get out of here.

587
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,080
What are you talking about?

588
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,590
My mother.

589
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,010
She lives next to the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.

590
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,070
She wasn't able to evacuate in time.

591
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,430
We still have five other nuclear reactors that are on the verge of melting down.

592
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,500
I need you at your station.

593
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,570
I don't care what you need.

594
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,270
You better start caring.

595
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,740
You have a choice right now.

596
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,750
Obey orders or end up in a jail cell.

597
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,400
You're going to arrest me for trying to save my mother's life?

598
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,610
Edgar, if what you're saying is true,

599
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,290
there's nothing you can do for your mother,

600
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,390
but there are thousands of other people whose lives you can save.

601
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,790
Suppose your mother were here right now.

602
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,710
What would make her proud?

603
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,190
What do you think she'd want you to do?

604
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,060
She'd want me to help.

605
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,890
Then don't you think you should?

606
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,970
We're ready to go. We're just setting up the comm line.

607
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,450
This is a pardon for your son signed by the president.

608
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,770
This is acceptable.

609
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,810
Where is he?

610
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,520
He's at Lindower Memorial Hospital.

611
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,310
It's not far.

612
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,230
Set up a perimeter around Lindower Memorial.

613
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,370
I want you to call him and tell him we're coming to pick him up.

614
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,370
Give her the phone.

615
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,680
We have to record the call.

616
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,010
Hello?

617
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,870
It's me.

618
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,900
Where are you?

619
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,350
Waiting for Nasim.

620
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,520
I don't know why he's taking so long.

621
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,570
Don't worry about that now.

622
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,840
Things have changed.

623
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,400
What do you mean?

624
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,010
Listen carefully, Behrooz.

625
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,110
Government agents found me.

626
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,630
I'm with them now.

627
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,920
Behrooz,

628
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,480
they know everything.

629
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,430
Behrooz, just a few more minutes, okay?

630
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,710
But it's all right.

631
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,120
Everything is going to be all right.

632
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,310
I made a deal.

633
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,570
What are you talking about?

634
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,440
You're going to be okay.

635
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,520
You won't be arrested- or even named- in any of this.

636
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,650
I don't understand.

637
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,240
I'm going to help them stop your father.

638
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,320
You are?

639
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,270
Yes.

640
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,920
You said that I would be okay.

641
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,240
But what about you?

642
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,250
We'll talk about that later.

643
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,340
Right now, these men are coming to pick you up.

644
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,800
I want you to go with them.

645
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,960
Are they making you say this?

646
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:40,620
No.

647
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,720
I don't know who these people are.

648
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,980
I want to be sure that they're not forcing you to say this.

649
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,610
I'll come with them.

650
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,400
You'll know when you see me. Okay?

651
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,640
I'll meet you outside.

652
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,330
No.

653
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,220
Tell him to go to the emergency room. I want him to stay where it's crowded.

654
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,580
Did you hear that?

655
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,020
Yes.

656
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,690
I'll see you in a few minutes, Behrooz.

657
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,540
Okay.

658
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,070
We're transferring the suspect. I want to set up a protective cordon right away.

659
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,020
Copy that.

660
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:12,990
Let's go.

661
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,150
Uncle Nasim.

662
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
I have to go.

663
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,810
What about the pain medication?

664
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,620
My mom's getting it from somewhere else, but thanks for trying.

665
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,120
Behrooz!

666
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:44,780
What are you doing?

667
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:45,960
I can't let you go. Why not?

668
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,150
I spoke to your father.

669
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,470
What?

670
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,710
He told me you need help.

671
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,930
You don't know what

672
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,170
you're talking about. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

673
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,380
I gave your father my word.

674
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,160
My father is a terrorist. He's involved in what's happened today.

675
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,770
- Stop talking, Behrooz.  - I swear, it's true.

676
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,780
- You're talking nonsense.  - No, I'm not!

677
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,080
He's behind the kidnapping this morning, and the reactors melting down.

678
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,830
We're all involved- my mother and me. We've killed people.

679
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,690
Your father will be furious when he hears this.

680
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,430
My father is coming here?

681
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,540
No!

682
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,570
Behrooz!

683
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,700
I tried to stop him.

684
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,120
You broke my heart, Behrooz.

685
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,650
You broke my heart.

686
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,170
If you kill me, Mother will tell them everything.

687
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,270
Tell who? The police. She's with them.

688
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,730
- I don't believe you.  - It's the truth.

689
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,070
She wants me to be safe and, if you kill me, she will ruin everything you're doing.

690
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,950
- Liar!  - If you don't believe me, look outside. They're coming to pick me up.

691
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,600
- Help!  - Shut up!

692
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,560
- Tony, did you notify Security?  - No.

693
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,190
Something is wrong.

694
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,110
Set up a Level Three cordon around the hospital.

695
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,280
I'm going with you.

696
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,170
No, you're not!

697
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,470
- What's going on here?  - There's been a shooting.

698
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,700
- Who?  - One of the pharmacists.

699
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,020
Who are you?

700
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,240
My name is Jack Bauer. I work with the Counterterrorist Unit.

701
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,420
We've been tracking the man who did the shooting.Where is he?

702
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,100
Someone just radioed in from C wing. Saw a Middle Eastern man running. He has a hostage.

703
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,870
- A 17-year-old boy?  - I think so.

704
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,650
What are the possible exits from that wing?

705
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,490
From where he was spotted, he's pretty much got to end up in the east parking garage.

706
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,320
We've got men heading there now.

707
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,410
You tell your supervisor to tell his men to back off.

708
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,200
No one makes contact with him. Do you understand me?

709
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,770
All right.

710
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,950
Hang on a sec.

711
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:05,540
Yeah?

712
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,380
Tony, it's Jack.

713
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,360
Navi Araz is here. He's already killed his wife's brother.

714
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,290
What about the boy?

715
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:10,970
I don't know.

716
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,820
We're going to have to lock down all the exits. I think he's headed for the parking garage.

717
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,240
I need you to meet me on the east side of the building with backup.

718
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,080
Copy that.

719
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,460
We're going to the east side of the building.

720
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,810
We need backup teams there right away.

721
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,830
What happened?

722
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,130
We're still looking for your son.

723
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,200
There is more. Tell me.

724
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,440
Mrs. Araz, we're going to find your son, all right?

725
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,320
I hate you.

726
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,020
I've always hated you.

727
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,550
The only reason I never said so

728
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,870
was because I was afraid of you.

729
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,910
But I'm not afraid of you anymore.

730
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,820
Get in. Go to hell.

731
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Get in!

732
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,400
Jack, we're in the garage now.

733
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,320
We've secured the exit.

734
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,140
I'm almost there. Can you get an ID?

735
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,900
No. Nothing yet.

736
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,410
Let me see your hands!

737
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,550
Put your hands where I can see them! Now!

738
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,330
Careful!

739
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,590
Drop the gun!

740
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,010
You'll hit the boy!

741
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,570
Let the boy go!

742
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,910
We can work this out.

743
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,090
I will put my gun down if you give me the boy.

744
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,940
All I want is the boy.

745
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,500
Stay back!

746
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,240
Put the g- Tony, stop the car!

747
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,250
Behrooz!

748
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,120
Mom!

749
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,810
Keep her in the car!

750
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,140
That stairwell leads to the basement. He's got nowhere to go but down.

751
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,890
Set up a link with CTU now!

752
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,520
Copy that.

753
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,260
Call CTU. We need backup here.

754
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,080
Mrs. Araz, calm down, we'll get your son, all right?

755
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,850
Calm down.

756
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,200
We've uploaded the plans to you from the building department.

757
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,850
There are only three exits from the hospital's basement.

758
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,820
We've got all entrances and exits covered. He's trapped down there.

759
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,660
Let's try to open up a negotiation.

760
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,720
My husband won't negotiate.

761
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,600
Why is that?

762
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,520
He doesn't need to.

763
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,630
He has to assume I have agreed to help you in return for my son's safety.

764
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,770
Well, he can't stay down there with him forever.

765
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,880
He won't.

766
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,610
In two hours, all the reactors will have gone critical.

767
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:01,000
After that, it won't matter what I tell you, and he can kill my son.

768
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,940
I am only helping you to save his life.

769
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,690
I believe in our cause,

770
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,100
and if you can'tsave my son,

771
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,250
I am happy to see the reactors melt down.

772
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,330
Did you get that?

773
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


774
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,640
- Excuse me, Ms. Driscoll?  - What is it, Chloe?

2
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,230
There was intelligence indicating the possibily of an attack at 8:00 this morning.

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,020
A Turkish national on the FBI watch list

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,860
by the name of Thomas Sherek was last seen in the city.

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,200
- It's Thomas.  - Did Dar get the briefcase?

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,610
Yes, he's on his way to you now.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,990
So far, everything is on schedule.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,490
The briefcase is on its way to us now.

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,540
When it gets here,

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,580
we'll take it to the warehouse.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,120
What we will accomplish today will change the world.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,380
We're fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this.

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,710
I found something on the Net I think you should know about.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,720
What?

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,890
I think someone's positioning code for a major Internet attack.

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,890
The thing is that not all the code remarks were in English.

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,770
- What language were they in?  - Arabic or Turkish, maybe.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,020
What did you find on the Internet?!

19
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,560
It was my friend, not me!

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,860
- What's his name?  - Andrew Paige.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,780
Is it going to be uncomfortable?

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,910
What?

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,950
Going back to CTU, seeing Driscoll again.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,830
I don't blame her for her decision.

25
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,500
She forced you out of CTU.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,710
I could have joined other agencies if I still wanted to do fieldwork,

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,500
but I didn't.

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,040
I know this guy.

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,130
Fortunately for you, Jack, it's our problem, not yours.

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,510
Erin, listen to me... this doesn't make sense.

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,510
You wouldn't risk exposing yourself

32
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,010
here in the United States for a train bombing.

33
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,350
It's not big enough.

34
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,770
We'll take that into consideration when we interrogate him.

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,730
I am not messing with you.

36
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,600
You're going to tell me. What is happening at 8:00!

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,270
Jack!

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,730
What is your primary objective?!

39
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,860
Secretary of Defense!

40
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,780
Heller.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,700
Did it ever occur to you that these people are using you?

42
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,660
Don't you realize they're letting you speak for one reason

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,250
because you are my son!

44
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,370
Audrey, it's Jack.

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,080
- Are you still at Richard's?  - Yeah.

46
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,750
You need to get your father out of there now.

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,300
Your father is the real target.

48
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh, my God.

49
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,510
Jack!

50
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,510
Audrey?

51
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,480
Audrey?!

52
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,510
Richard Heller?

53
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,760
They took my father and my sister.

54
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,800
I don't care. It's been over five minutes.

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,340
You need to widen your perimeter.

56
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,970
You're not listening to me. I'm not interested in local law enforcement.

57
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,890
I want Secret Service swarming that area now.

58
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,850
Good. Get back to me.

59
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,560
Everyone...

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,650
everyone, please listen up.

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,940
Secretary of Defense Heller was abducted a few minutes ago,

62
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,990
along with his senior policy analyst Audrey Raines.

63
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,410
Heller was at his son Richard's house when he was taken.

64
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,990
LAPD is bringing Richard in for questioning.

65
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,330
This is a top-priority situation.

66
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,580
I want all inter-agency protocols activated immediately.

67
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,550
Move off that page.

68
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,090
You have to link up to the Secret Service Channel.

69
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,050
It's not that simple. We're locked out for a few minutes.

70
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,930
Why?

71
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,510
They're sequestering the rest of the Cabinet.

72
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,100
Driscoll's not going to want to hear that.

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,390
She wants us to activate these protocols.

74
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,470
What do you want me to do?

75
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,560
I want you to break through those channels. Hack in if you have to.

76
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,980
Chloe, I need you to move everything from the train bombing

77
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,650
to the secondary server.

78
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,690
- I did that already.  - Good.

79
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,690
Then re-key the databases so the kidnapping and bombing are synched up as well.

80
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,610
- I did that, too.  - What haven't you done?

81
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,620
I haven't opened a pipe to the Army Criminal Investigation Division yet.

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,990
- Do it.  - I'm on my way to.

83
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,750
Yeah, I'm looking at it. They've widened the perimeter.

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you have an I.D. on any possible transportation?

85
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm working on it. The only problem we have...

86
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm going to have to get back to you.

87
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,500
Erin, I need to speak to you.

88
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
You're done here, Jack.

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,710
- Just listen to me.  - I'm detaining you...

90
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,170
Erin, just listen to me!

91
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,920
Secretary Heller is my responsibility.

92
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,510
Now, I need you to reinstate me on a provisional basis until I get him back.

93
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,140
You don't give me orders, Jack.

94
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,270
I'm detaining you until an investigator from Division can take your statement.

95
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,850
I'm going to recommend that you be arrested for torturing a suspect

96
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,270
and rendering him useless for questioning.

97
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,690
You weren't getting anywhere with him.

98
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,150
Because of me, Sherek told you everything he knows.

99
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,690
You'd better hope so.

100
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,950
Would you please escort Mr. Bauer to a vacant office until Division gets here?

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,740
I'm fine.

102
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,910
You're making a mistake.

103
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,040
- Excuse me.  - What?

104
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,250
- President Keeler.  - What about him?

105
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,500
- He wants to talk to you.  - All right.

106
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,800
- This is Erin Driscoll.  - Please hold for the President.

107
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,470
What can you tell me about the attack on the Secretary?

108
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,520
We know that he was taken along with his daughter,

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,180
approximately ten minutes ago.

110
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,310
But you haven't had any contact yet from the kidnappers?

111
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
No, sir, we have not.

112
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,270
How is it the Secret Service wasn't able to protect him?

113
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,320
It's my understanding that he broke his schedule to visit his son.

114
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,120
Somehow the kidnappers had access to that information.

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,700
We're looking into that now.

116
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,490
All right.

117
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,080
We're gonna go to an elevated level of security.

118
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,130
I want you to take the appropriate measures.

119
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:19,710
I understand.

120
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,210
Get them back, Erin.

121
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,840
We're doing everything we can, sir.

122
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,300
Hello.

123
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,510
- Mom?  - Hi, sweetie.

124
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,510
- I didn't expect to hear...  - Mom, listen to me.

125
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,180
You got to get out of the house right now.

126
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,220
What are you talking about?

127
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,680
Someone's looking for me, and they might come for you next.

128
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,020
What kind of trouble are you in?

129
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
I don't know.

130
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,030
I found something on the Internet. Now these people are after me.

131
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
Andrew, you are being paranoid.

132
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,610
Mom, they killed Melanie. They killed everybody in the office.

133
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
- What?!  - They shot 'em.

134
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,580
- Mom, I'm really scared.  - My God.

135
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,290
I'm going to call the police.

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,460
Just get out of there!

137
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,750
Get to one of your friends' houses and stay there! Go! Go now!

138
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Andrew?!

139
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,450
I told them Driscoll wanted me to question you.

140
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,200
What's going on, Chloe? What are you doing?

141
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,080
I'll probably get in trouble for coming to you with this, but I don't care.

142
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,540
I may have a way to find Heller.

143
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,500
I'm being detained. Why are you telling me?

144
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,710
Because I don't think Driscoll's handling this the right way,

145
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,630
and I don't trust her. I trust you.

146
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,720
Sit down.

147
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,180
A good friend of mine called about 40 minutes ago.

148
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,980
This is someone I went to school with.

149
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,560
I know him. He wouldn't have come to me unless it was something serious.

150
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,560
What is it?

151
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,650
He noticed some dangerous computer code was planted on the Internet this morning.

152
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,150
How is that connected to Heller?

153
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,490
Because it originated in Turkey

154
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,110
just like everything else that happened today.

155
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,410
Sherek, the train bombing.

156
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,490
Where's your friend now?

157
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,380
LAPD has cordoned off the area,

158
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,590
and you can see them taking Secretary Heller's son away from the scene now.

159
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,220
That's being done for his own protection, according to a police sources.

160
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,930
Those same sources tell us

161
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,760
that at least five Secret Service agents were shot and killed

162
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,220
in the kidnapping.

163
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,400
There is also a belief tonight that the Secretary's daughter...

164
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,150
- Hello?  - Andrew, it's me.

165
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,400
What did you do, Chloe? Who did you tell?

166
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,980
What do you mean?

167
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,240
Everyone's dead!

168
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,860
They're dead!

169
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,490
Now they're trying to kill me!

170
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,530
Andrew, talk to me. Who's dead? What happened?

171
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,240
Everyone's dead! They're dead.

172
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,500
After I called you, I went back to my office.

173
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,830
There was a guy there torturing Melanie.

174
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,750
He wanted to know who hacked into their system.

175
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,550
And then he shot her!

176
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,970
God...

177
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,180
Who shot her?

178
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,720
Who's this?

179
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,300
My name is Jack Bauer. I work for Secretary of Defense Heller.

180
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,890
Andrew, we need your help.

181
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,680
What?!

182
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,850
Secretary Heller was kidnapped less than half an hour ago.

183
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,270
I believe the same people that kidnapped him

184
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,400
are the ones that are chasing you now.

185
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,980
But I don't know anything!

186
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,690
Son, you've been targeted for a reason.

187
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,110
You know more than you think.

188
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,280
What... What do I do?

189
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,780
Where are you?

190
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,490
I'm at Union Station. I'm getting out of town.

191
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,080
No, you stay put.

192
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,500
The best thing you can do right now is let me bring you in.

193
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,210
Chloe, what should I do?

194
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,630
You can trust Jack.

195
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,510
Okay.

196
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,510
I'll be next to track three,

197
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,890
at the bottom of the ramp.

198
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,100
Andrew, what are you wearing?

199
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,690
Uh, bluejeans, brown, brown jacket and a, and a black bag.

200
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,190
Okay, you stay put. I'll be there in about

201
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
30 minutes.

202
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,530
Okay.

203
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,150
This is all my fault.

204
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,490
I shouldn't have let Driscoll talk me into handing it over to the FBI.

205
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,620
She did what?

206
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,910
She told me to give it to the FBI.

207
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,440
Yes.

208
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,480
I found the person who stumbled onto our server.

209
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,570
Is he with you now?

210
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,480
No. I'll have him shortly.

211
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,190
Find out who he's talked to.

212
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,490
Of course.

213
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,280
And then kill him.

214
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,700
Yes.

215
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,880
- Is everything in there?  - Yes.

216
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,590
Where's Behrooz?

217
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,880
Upstairs, checking traffic on-line.

218
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,510
It's almost time for him to go.

219
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,930
Are you sure you don't want me to take the briefcase to Omar?

220
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,810
The plan is in place.

221
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,140
I don't want to deviate.

222
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Why?

223
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,070
This is the key to everything we're doing today.

224
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,530
It's a lot to entrust to a teenager.

225
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,690
I told you...

226
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,950
our whereabouts have to be accounted for today.

227
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,160
Besides, it's because he's a teenager that he won't arouse suspicion.

228
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,790
You're right.

229
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,590
Don't worry, Dina.

230
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,670
We've prepared well for today.

231
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,630
The train, the kidnapping, it's all gone as expected.

232
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,550
I spoke with Omar.

233
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,810
He's happy.

234
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,940
And he knows Behrooz is the one who will deliver the device?

235
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,150
Yes, he knows.

236
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Behrooz will be fine.

237
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,250
Okay, people, we're looking to find a connection

238
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,830
between the train bombing in Santa Clarita and Heller's abduction.

239
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,000
Sarah?

240
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,670
NTSB has given us a full passenger list.

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,670
We're processing those names now.

242
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,840
What about Heller's son?

243
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,550
Is it possible he had something to do with this?

244
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,510
We're not counting anything out at this point.

245
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,100
He's being brought in here for questioning now.

246
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,640
Erin, I need to speak with you privately, please?

247
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,440
- You're testing me, Jack?  - Erin, please.

248
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,400
Curtis will hand out assignment protocols to each department.

249
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,110
I want status reports every 15 minutes.

250
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,210
I have information that you ignored that appears to be connected

251
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,090
not only to the bombing but the kidnapping of Secretary Heller.

252
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,340
What information?

253
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,510
A computer programmer by the name of Andrew Paige

254
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,510
accidentally came across a possible Internet strike earlier this morning.

255
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,390
I know. It was passed on to the FBI.

256
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,140
Yes, against CTU protocol.

257
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,970
You abandoned an active investigation

258
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,890
by a CTU agent during a terrorist strike.

259
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,980
I just got confirmation from the LAPD

260
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,020
that Andrew Paige's co-workers were all found dead less than 20 minutes ago.

261
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,280
I'll coordinate with FBI

262
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,900
and we'll take over the investigation of that lead.

263
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
No, you won't.

264
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,160
I just talked to the kid. I'm the only one who knows where he is.

265
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,580
You want that kid picked up, you're gonna have to reinstate me.

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,870
I'm having you locked up for impeding my investigation.

267
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,920
You do that and I'll tell the president

268
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,670
that you had Sherek in custody over a half an hour

269
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,510
before Secretary Heller was even kidnapped,

270
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,220
and that you couldn't break him.

271
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,050
I did.

272
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,760
You threatening me, Jack?

273
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,520
I am asking you to let me help rescue Secretary Heller.

274
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,620
This is how it's gonna work.

275
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,670
I'll reinstate your commission on a temporary basis until Heller is safe.

276
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,750
You will not make any unilateral decisions.

277
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,380
You will work as an auxiliary agent under the authority of Ronnie Lobell

278
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,010
and then I'll hand you over to Division.

279
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,340
What are they going to do to us?

280
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,050
I don't know, but if they wanted me dead,

281
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,130
they would have killed me at Richard's house.

282
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,430
Richard. My God.

283
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,220
He was still in the house. I don't think they went in there.

284
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,390
Listen to me, Audie, no matter what happens to me,

285
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,440
they have no reason to hurt you.

286
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,110
They don't need a reason.

287
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,190
And I don't want you to give 'em one.

288
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,190
Do what they say.

289
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,200
Whatever happens to me, don't provoke them.

290
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,700
If they threaten me, if they hurt me...

291
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,530
even if they kill me...

292
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,620
do what they say.

293
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,180
I only asked for Heller.

294
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,680
I didn't want to kill her without your permission.

295
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,640
- Daddy! No! Dad!  - Leave her alone!

296
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,890
Don't you touch her!

297
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,060
So help me, God I will kill you myself.

298
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,230
Dad! No!

299
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,650
Son of a bitch!

300
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,650
Come on!

301
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,980
Yes or no?

302
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,400
Do not do this!

303
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,490
Leave her alone!

304
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,580
Not yet.

305
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,000
We may be able to use her.

306
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,710
Take them away.

307
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,550
Dad. Dad.

308
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,070
I'm going with Ronnie over to the train station to pick up Andrew now.

309
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,650
Has Driscoll cleared you for fieldwork?

310
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,280
- Yeah.  - That's unlike her.

311
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,950
I hope you didn't tell her I gave you the information.

312
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,360
I'm not in the mood for a confrontation.

313
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,280
I didn't.

314
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,450
Have we heard anything from any of the Secret Service agents

315
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,740
that survived the kidnapping?

316
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,450
There's only one so far, he's in surgery.

317
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,790
Any other witnesses?

318
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,920
The son Richard. They're bringing him in now.

319
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,090
Okay. Get back to me as soon as you've got anything on Secretary Heller or Audrey.

320
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,840
Sure. Bad luck about Audrey being there when her dad got kidnapped.

321
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,010
Yeah.

322
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,350
I'm going to my car to get my things.

323
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,980
Okay, so let me understand this.

324
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,270
Bauer illegally shoots a suspect

325
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,230
and now you're going to let him back in the field.

326
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,150
He'll only give us the location if I let him work it.

327
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,610
He can't hold back information, Erin. It's not his privilege.

328
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,950
We don't have time to interrogate him.

329
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,910
It's a simple job, Ronnie.

330
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,910
You pick up the subject and you bring him in.

331
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,460
Bauer has not been in the field for a year and a half, okay?

332
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,420
That has consequences. It's my ass that's...

333
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,040
Which is why I need you to keep him on a tight leash.

334
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,090
It's not optional, it's an order.

335
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,840
Fine.

336
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,320
I'm ready to go.

337
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,200
This is a simple task, Behrooz,

338
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,030
but these are the ones where mistakes can be made.

339
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,660
Drive carefully.

340
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,040
If there is anyone in the area who looks suspicious,

341
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,830
drive away and call us.

342
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,330
Understood?

343
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,500
Yes.

344
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
Hello.

345
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,510
Mrs. Araz, this is Debbie.

346
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,890
Yes, Debbie, what can I do for you?

347
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,930
Can I please talk to Behrooz?

348
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,690
Let me see if he's here. Hold on.

349
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,440
- What does she want?  - I don't know.

350
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,110
Debbie?

351
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,150
I've left like ten messages on your cell phone.

352
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,530
Why haven't you called me back?

353
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,910
I'm sorry. I've been busy.

354
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,490
Doing what?

355
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,660
Working for my father.

356
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,040
I don't believe you.

357
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,920
Look, Behrooz, if you're seeing someone else,

358
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,880
at least have the decency to tell me.

359
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,710
I'm not seeing anyone else.

360
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,000
Then why are you avoiding me?

361
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,300
I'm not.

362
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,630
Look, Debbie, this isn't the right time to do this.

363
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,430
See? That's what I'm talking about. Now, you're still avoing me.

364
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,890
I'm not.

365
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,020
Then why can't we talk now?

366
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,140
Because I can't.

367
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,400
I've gotta go.

368
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,440
Behrooz!

369
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,150
Behrooz.

370
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,110
That's not the right way to deal with this situation.

371
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,410
This girl needs to know it's over

372
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,040
and that there will be no more phone calls.

373
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,250
I'll take care of it later, Mom.

374
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,080
I don't want to be late getting this to Omar.

375
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,930
You sent Jack Bauer out in the field?

376
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,600
He'll be with Ronnie.

377
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
Yeah, but why?

378
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,270
He knows our procedures,

379
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,850
and he may have information about Heller that'll be useful.

380
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,850
What is it, Chloe?

381
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,110
Curtis, you wanted me to tell you when Richard Heller had arrived.

382
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,610
He's on his way to Holding.

383
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,280
All right, thanks.

384
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,610
Do you want me to choreograph the jurisdictions?

385
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,740
No, I'll do it. Find out what the son knows.

386
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,450
Chloe, I'd like to talk to you.

387
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,790
Has it occurred to you that we might be farther along

388
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,540
if you trusted me half as much as you trust Jack Bauer?

389
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,290
You know what, Ms. Driscoll?

390
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm really not in the mood to play the part

391
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,760
of the scared student in the principal's office.

392
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,760
I came to you with important information that my friend Andrew gave to me,

393
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,140
and you chose to not respond to it.

394
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,390
When you came to me with the original information,

395
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,600
we were looking for Sherek, were we not?

396
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,180
Yes.

397
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,480
He was our most important lead at the time, wasn't he?

398
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,560
I guess.

399
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,570
Then my question to you is,

400
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,030
once we had Sherek in custody,

401
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,820
if you felt that your Internet lead was still valuable,

402
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,070
why didn't you reprise it?

403
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,330
You're right. I felt more comfortable going to Jack.

404
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,670
Well, at least that's honest.

405
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,840
You can go back to work now.

406
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,020
Check that, please.

407
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,400
For the record, Jack,

408
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,070
I think Driscoll made a mistake by letting you come along.

409
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,030
All right.

410
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,030
And just so we're clear, I give the orders.

411
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,950
I'm fine with that.

412
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Look, what happened earlier in Holding with Sherek

413
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,080
I had intel that told me I didn't have time to do it any other way. I'm sorry.

414
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,830
Apology accepted, but if you try to exceed my authority again,

415
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,290
I will stop you cold.

416
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,850
Okay, fine.

417
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,900
Then talk to Marcy, have her isolate all the death threats

418
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,480
Heller's received over the last six months.

419
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,570
I want phone calls, e-mails, snail mails,

420
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,730
everything sent over to CTU for analysis.

421
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,950
Well, for the time being, I'm working with them.

422
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,950
Yeah.

423
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,910
Okay, good. Thanks.

424
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,910
Has Heller been getting a lot of death threats lately?

425
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,500
No more than anyone else in the Cabinet.

426
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,710
So, what's it like working in DC?

427
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,300
For the most part, we solve problems in theory that'll never come into play.

428
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,550
You wouldn't be interested.

429
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,010
Then why do it?

430
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,140
I've got my reasons.

431
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,350
Hey, man, I'm just trying to make some conversation.

432
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,810
I read your file.

433
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,770
Must've really burned you up when Driscoll fired you.

434
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,610
She did me a favor.

435
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,030
I wanted to get my life back.

436
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,450
I wouldn't have been able to do that if I was still doing fieldwork.

437
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,780
So, how's the master plan going? Do you have a life yet?

438
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,040
Yeah.

439
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,380
Yeah, I got a life.

440
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,600
We'll be fine, Audie.

441
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,930
We're still on U.S. soil.

442
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,400
That's not going to help us if this is some sort of suicide mission.

443
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,820
You said Jack tried to warn you about this, before they grabbed us.

444
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,780
Yeah, that's right.

445
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,120
That means he must have a reliable source,

446
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,240
which means our chances are good.

447
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,090
Audie, sit down.

448
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,970
I am your father.

449
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,390
Do you trust me?

450
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,810
- Of course I do.  - Then listen.

451
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,770
You cannot allow a negative thought to enter your head now.

452
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,320
They will find us. We will be rescued.

453
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,440
- Say it.  - Please, Dad...

454
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,910
We will be rescued. Say it, Audie.

455
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,620
We will be rescued.

456
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,580
We will be rescued.

457
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,350
Take off your clothes.

458
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,520
You first.

459
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,270
Take off your clothes.

460
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,160
Go to hell.

461
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,130
Stop! Please stop it! Dad...

462
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,020
- Who is it?  - It's Behrooz.

463
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,660
Behrooz?

464
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,850
Good job, Behrooz.

465
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,090
Debbie, what are you doing here?

466
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,880
- I followed you.  - Why?

467
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,510
Because I didn't believe you.

468
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,430
I thought you were seeing someone else.

469
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,340
Look around. Does it look like I'm seeing anybody else?

470
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,930
Debbie, you shouldn't be here. I'm here doing business for my father.

471
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,390
He doesn't like me socializing when I'm working for him.

472
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,150
Okay.

473
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,190
I get it.

474
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,400
That doesn't explain why you stopped calling me.

475
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,070
It's my parents.

476
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,240
They've got a problem with me seeing someone who's...

477
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,410
Not Muslim?

478
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,580
Yeah.

479
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,380
And that's it?

480
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,250
- Whatever they say, you do.  - No.

481
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,340
Then what's going on between us, Behrooz?

482
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,710
Do you want to be with me or not?

483
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,840
- I do, but...  - But what?

484
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,640
Debbie, I want to straighten things out, okay?

485
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,810
But I can't do it now.

486
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,810
We'll get together later.

487
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,440
Debbie, please...

488
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
Is everything ready in Richard Heller's holding cell?

489
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,260
Just about.

490
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,180
They brought in the equipment and they're starting to hook him up.

491
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,430
Then let's do it.

492
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,230
Does Driscoll know you're subjecting

493
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,310
the Secretary of Defense's son to a lie detector?

494
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,310
Yes.

495
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,770
- Is he a suspect?  - Not exactly.

496
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,480
But he's on very poor terms with his father.

497
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,110
I wouldn't want to rule anything out.

498
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,700
You want to be in the room on this?

499
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,700
No. I'll observe through the one-way.

500
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,700
Okay.

501
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,290
What are you doing to me?

502
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,130
What are you doing?!

503
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,090
We just want to make sure you're telling us the truth.

504
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,880
Why would I lie to you?!

505
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,760
My father and sister have just been kidnapped...!

506
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,430
Please sit back, Richard,

507
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,340
or I'll have to sedate you.

508
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,050
You can't do this to me.

509
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,100
My father is the Secretary of Defense.

510
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,180
I understand.

511
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,600
But according to my information,

512
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,350
you were about to unleash personal attacks

513
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,730
on your father and the President at a rally at Lockheed today.

514
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,480
Are you insane?

515
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,740
This is America. I can say what I want in public.

516
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,650
How dare you treat me like a criminal.

517
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,360
No one's treating you like a criminal.

518
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,660
You want to do something constructive?

519
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,450
Why don't you go find my father and my sister.

520
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,990
We intend to.

521
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,790
Yeah, by treating me like I'm guilty or something!

522
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,000
Richard...

523
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,290
right now you're the only witness to your father and your sister's kidnapping.

524
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,380
We need your help.

525
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,090
Then why don't you get these things off of me

526
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,050
and start talking to me like a normal human being.

527
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,590
You don't have anything to hide, do you?

528
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,560
No.

529
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,060
How's the polygraph?

530
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,890
100 percent.

531
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,700
Father.

532
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,290
How did everything go?

533
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,790
It went fine.

534
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,350
Omar said one of his men saw you with someone outside the compound

535
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,100
a young woman.

536
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,480
I was going to tell you.

537
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,060
Who was it?

538
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,030
Debbie.

539
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,360
Where is she now?

540
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,610
She didn't see anything.

541
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,820
She saw you outside at the compound. That's enough.

542
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,410
No...

543
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,920
We've spent years planning for this, waiting for this day to come.

544
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,130
Now it's here and you've compromised everything.

545
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,800
She didn't see anything, I made sure of it.

546
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,470
We'll see how much she knows.

547
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,760
Call her and tell her to come here.

548
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,390
Father, please don't do this, it's not necessary.

549
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,680
I decide what's necessary, not you.

550
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,980
What are you going to do to her?

551
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,070
Since when do you question me?

552
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,910
How long have we lived in this country preparing for this day?

553
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,160
How long?!

554
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,740
Four years.

555
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,160
Almost five.

556
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,710
That's how much time can be erased by a simple mistake.

557
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,180
Call her. Now!

558
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,310
Yes, sir.

559
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,190
Tim Felson, MTA.

560
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,280
Ronnie Lobell, CTU. Head of field ops.

561
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,870
Where's track three?

562
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,450
East entrance. If you want, I can have my guys lock it down.

563
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,000
No, no. Don't want to draw attention to anything yet.

564
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,120
The platform's just at the end of this hallway.

565
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,180
- Hello.  - Andrew, it's me.

566
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,060
Where are these guys?

567
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,770
They're outside. They should be there any minute.

568
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,900
All right. Tell them to hurry up.

569
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,060
It doesn't work that way.

570
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,610
Just stay where you are and I'll talk to you when they bring you in.

571
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,780
Okay.

572
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,190
Andrew?

573
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,530
Yeah. Are you Jack Bauer?

574
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,280
Yes. Come on, let's go.

575
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,620
Where are we going?

576
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
I'll explain later. It's not safe here.

577
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,160
Let's go.

578
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,000
Just around the corner.

579
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,600
You sure he said the bottom of the ramp?

580
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,020
Yeah.

581
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,950
- Hello.  - Andrew.

582
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,160
- Who's this?  - It's Jack Bauer. Where are you?

583
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,000
Andrew?

584
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,750
I can't really, uh... talk.

585
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,090
Let's go.

586
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,590
Andrew? Andrew?!

587
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,930
Son of a bitch, they got to him before we did.

588
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,680
How did they know where he was going to be?

589
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,970
I don't know!

590
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,810
Who are you?

591
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,140
I'm the man that's going to kill you if you don't follow my instructions.

592
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,310
Felson, come on.

593
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,560
Alert your MTA's.

594
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,480
Tell them we've got a Caucasian male, early 20s,

595
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,690
wearing a brown jacket and carrying a black bag

596
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,360
being taken from this station against his will.

597
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,950
Tell your men not to engage the target.

598
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,740
I want a visual and a location, that's it.

599
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,950
Now.

600
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,960
Where are you taking me?

601
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,310
This is Marx, I have the target sighted.

602
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,310
Where's your twenty?

603
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,930
I'm on the train platform.

604
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,190
Target is on the East periphery.

605
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,150
Second level parking lot.

606
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,900
Open the door.

607
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,110
They're getting in a dark blue Lexus.

608
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,150
What's the fastest way?

609
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,150
Straight out the back.

610
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,240
Tell your man to stay out of sight.

611
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,820
Marx, stay on the guy, but make sure he doesn't see you.

612
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,410
Lay down.

613
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,000
There he is.

614
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,260
You get the gate, I'll get the kid out of the car.

615
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,550
Wait.

616
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,720
Wait for what?

617
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,050
This isn't the right play.

618
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,600
What are you talking about?

619
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,680
If we follow this guy, maybe he'll lead us to Heller.

620
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,230
Or maybe he won't, but you know he'll kill the kid, Jack.

621
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,400
Right now, this hostile's our best chance to find Secretary Heller.

622
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,730
We'll break him back at CTU.

623
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,940
You don't know if you can break him in time.

624
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,990
This is not a field ops call, Jack.

625
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,910
- We need authorization.  - No.

626
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,080
I can't take the chance of Driscoll resisting me.

627
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,590
I told you not to go against me, Jack.

628
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,640
Ronnie, please...

629
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,140
You get up, enterlace your hands behind your head.

630
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,310
- You're making a mistake.  - Shut up.

631
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,740
Gate four. He's leaving the parking lot. What do you want me to do?

632
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,040
This is Agent Lobell. I'm moving in now.

633
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,460
Let the front car go ahead and lock in the hostile.

634
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,530
Ronnie.

635
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,360
Ronnie, where you been hit?

636
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,410
Can you move?

637
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,540
Ronnie...

638
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,200
Give me the keys to the cuffs.

639
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,210
Please, Ronnie.

640
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,760
He's our only lead.

641
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,800
We gotta stop him.

642
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,350
Come on!

643
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,250
Damn it.

644
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,240
Tell me what happened, Richard.

645
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,410
My father and I were talking, and...

646
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,910
my sister came in with a phone call for him.

647
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,660
So he was in the room on the call?

648
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,460
No. He and Audrey went outside.

649
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,340
Go on.

650
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,170
And then I heard an explosion,

651
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,460
and I looked out the window and I see them both being grabbed.

652
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,260
And they didn't come in and get you?

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,390
Excuse me. I know you told me not to interrupt, but we need you on the floor.

654
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,550
What's going on?

655
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,180
A webcast signal is being pushed onto servers all over the place.

656
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,680
A webcast of what?

657
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,390
Secretary of Defense Heller.

658
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,360
The terrorists are broadcasting this all over the Internet.

659
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,230
Call Curtis.

660
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,280
Curtis, we need you on the floor.

661
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,730
There you are, you son of a bitch.

662
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,230
We speak for the men, women and children who've had no voice until now,

663
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,230
who've been victimized by the genocidal policies of the United States

664
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,150
that James Heller has advanced.

665
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,200
But the time has come for the victims to demand justice.

666
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,780
Edgar, isolate Secretary Heller.

667
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:21,330
Our soldiers have taken the terrorist James Heller into custody.

668
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,500
In three hours, Heller will be tried for war crimes against humanity.

669
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,630
If he is proven guilty,

670
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,590
he will be executed in accordance with our laws.

671
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,930
Because we have nothing to hide,

672
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,930
the world will have full access to these proceedings.

673
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


674
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,030
Who is this?

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,330
Andrew, my name is Jack Bauer. 

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,030
I work for Secretary of Defense Heller. 

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,800
Secretary Heller was kidnapped less than half an hour ago. 

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,600
I believe the same people that kidnapped him

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,060
are the ones that are chasing you now. 

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,400
The safest thing for you to do

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,030
right now is let me bring you in. 

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,530
I found the person who stumbled

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,500
onto our server. 

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
Is he with you now?

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,530
No, I'll have him shortly. 

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,930
Find out who he's talked to. 

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,100
Who are you?

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,860
I'm the man that's going to kill you

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,400
if you don't follow my instructions. 

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,630
This is a simple task, Behrooz, 

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,830
but these are the ones where mistakes can be made. 

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,400
Debbie, what are you doing here?

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,660
I followed you. 

21
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,460
Omar saw you with someone

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,860
outside the compound. 

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,430
She didn't see anything. 

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,630
I made sure of it. 

25
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,030
We've spent years planning for this, 

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,030
waiting for this day to come. 

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,660
Now it's here and you've compromised everything. 

28
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,460
It's a simple job, Ronnie. 

29
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,400
You pick up the subject and you bring him in. 

30
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,060
Bauer has not been in the field for a year and half, okay?

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,800
Which is why I need you to keep him on a tight leash. 

32
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,860
For the record, Jack, 

33
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,400
I think Driscoll made a mistake

34
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,530
letting you come along. 

35
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,560
You get the gate. 

36
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,800
I'll get the kid out of the car. 

37
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,500
My father's the Secretary of Defense. 

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,660
Richard, 

39
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,000
right now you're the only witness

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,930
to your father and your sister's kidnapping. 

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,300
We need your help. 

42
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,030
You don't have anything to hide, do you?

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,960
We'll be fine, Audie. We're still on US soil. 

44
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,100
- What are they going to do to us?  - I don't know, 

45
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,430
but if they wanted me dead

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,260
they would have killed me at Richard's house. 

47
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,500
Our soldiers have taken

48
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,730
the terrorist James Heller into custody. 

49
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,230
In three hours, Heller will be tried for

50
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,960
war crimes against humanity. 

51
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,460
If he is proven guilty, 

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,460
he will be executed, in accordance with our laws. 

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,900
As you are all aware, the Secretary of Defense

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,230
and his daughter have been kidnapped by a terrorist cell. 

55
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,900
The terrorists have announced that they will put Jim on trial

56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,730
for war crimes, then execute him. 

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,230
All of it broadcast for the world. 

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,930
Make no mistake, this country is under attack. 

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,330
Foreign terrorists are operating on our soil. 

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,830
And intelligence indicates

61
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,500
that the kidnapping may be some kind of trigger, 

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,130
the first step in a series of larger attacks. 

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,530
Mark, what kind of protective

64
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,530
actions are being taken?

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,530
We've changed all the codes and protocols

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,930
the Secretary has knowledge of. 

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,460
Also, the other Cabinet members

68
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,560
have been sequestered. 

69
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,660
All right. Melissa?

70
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,260
Where are we with trying to keep

71
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,960
these people from broadcasting?

72
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,630
The media outlets will all cooperate and not air it. 

73
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,100
But the terrorists have announced

74
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,500
that they will use the Internet, 

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,130
and we cannot control that. 

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,530
They're using technology that makes their feed untraceable, 

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,530
and we can't shut down the Internet

78
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,700
without disabling

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
the command and control functions

80
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,900
of the government and the economy. 

81
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,400
Mr. President, the only way to stop this is at the source. 

82
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,830
We have to find the terrorists, 

83
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,000
and rescue Secretary Heller. 

84
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,000
Erin, where is CTU on this?

85
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,860
We have search teams out in force

86
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,300
and we're working a few active leads, sir. 

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,430
Anything promising?

88
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,130
We'll know very shortly, Mr President. 

89
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,730
Keep us closely posted. 

90
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,930
Ladies and gentlemen, 

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
nothing takes priority

92
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,660
over finding the people who have Jim Heller

93
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,760
and stopping them. 

94
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,160
Thank you. 

95
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,930
Where are we with Heller's son?

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,700
We're still trying to find out what he knows. 

97
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,930
If he had anything to do with his father's abduction, 

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,630
we need to know.  Get on it. 

99
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Then try his emergency frequency. 

100
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,930
What's going on?

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,530
Where's Ronnie and Bauer with the witness?

102
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,530
- We don't know.  - What?

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,960
I just got off the phone

104
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,030
with transit. A hostile intercepted Andrew Paige

105
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,960
at the station. We can't reach Ronnie

106
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,560
- or Jack.  - What do you mean you can't

107
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,200
reach them? They're not answering

108
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,460
their phones and there's been a report of a shooting

109
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,330
at the station. I'm checking for an update right now. 

110
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,430
Get recent pictures

111
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,530
of Andrew Paige and get them

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,760
to our people on the ground. 

113
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,560
Also set up a security grid around the station. 

114
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,700
My system's already logged on

115
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,160
to the station. I can get it faster. 

116
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,000
All right. Fine. You do tactical with me. 

117
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go, Edgar. 

118
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,300
Edgar Stiles. 

119
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,260
Miss Driscoll. 

120
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,760
Jack Bauer's on line one. 

121
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,000
Where are you? Why have you

122
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,360
and Ronnie not been in contact?

123
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,060
Erin, Ronnie's been killed. 

124
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,630
What are you talking about?

125
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,700
He was shot by a hostile who kidnapped Andrew Paige. 

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,000
Where are you now?

127
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,160
I'm in transit. I'm tracking them, but he doesn't know it. 

128
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,860
Give me your location, and I'll send backup to apprehend him. 

129
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,430
Erin, I don't think that's the right call. 

130
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
I believe if I follow them,  they're going to lead me

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,200
to Secretary Heller and the men who kidnapped him. 

132
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,430
Listen to me. Terrorists have

133
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,260
just announced that they are going to try

134
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,630
and execute Heller in less than

135
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,660
three hours. Bring the man in now. 

136
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,730
Right now this is our best chance of finding him by then. 

137
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,100
Jack, we had a deal. 

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,130
Erin, you're breaking up. Listen, have SWAT

139
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,660
and rescue teams standing by. 

140
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,900
I'll call you as soon as the hostile reaches his destination. 

141
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,160
That call

142
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,400
do you have a location?

143
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,930
No, it had a block on it. 

144
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,330
I've just been informed that Ronnie Lobell

145
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
has been killed in the line of duty. 

146
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,960
The killer was a hostile connected to Heller's abduction. 

147
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,130
At this point, 

148
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,230
Jack Bauer is no longer cooperating

149
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,730
with this investigation. 

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,130
All departments need to be working on the location

151
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,160
and capture of Jack Bauer and the hostile

152
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,430
that he's tracking now. 

153
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
Sarah, I need you to reconfigure the grid

154
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,660
and to include routes away from the station. 

155
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,730
I want all ground teams on this. 

156
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,660
MTA Downtown. 

157
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,030
This is Chloe O'Brian from CTU. 

158
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,460
Do you have any new information

159
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,500
about the kid who was abducted from your station?

160
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,700
No, we told you

161
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,160
everything we had a few minutes ago. 

162
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,560
What about surveillance cams?

163
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,500
I can access them if you give me the port codes. 

164
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,030
We're looking at them right now, Miss O'Brian. 

165
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,030
There's nothing. 

166
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,130
Thanks. 

167
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,330
Yes?

168
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,630
What are you doing there?

169
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,430
I need you to help me with this grid. 

170
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,060
What kind of help do you need?

171
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,560
The northeast quadrant is pass-coded and I don't... 

172
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,900
- Pilot L-1.  - What?

173
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,200
That's the log in. 

174
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,300
Chloe could you just get back here?

175
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,230
My friend Andrew,  who I promised would be

176
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,930
okay, do you mind if I try to find him?

177
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,860
Get down!

178
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,060
Yes?

179
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,060
I have the programmer. 

180
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,460
Good. We need to know

181
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,860
what he told CTU as soon as possible. 

182
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,200
Proceed as planned. 

183
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,360
Understood. 

184
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,200
There was a problem at the train station. 

185
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,430
What happened?

186
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,530
A federal agent interfered, 

187
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,560
I killed him. 

188
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,730
Are you being pursued?

189
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,860
No, anyone that left the station after me

190
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,600
would have caught up to me by now. 

191
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,160
Unless they don't want you to know they're there. 

192
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,160
Take precautions. 

193
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,900
Make sure that you are not being followed. Go. 

194
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,560
Move!

195
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,700
Dad. 

196
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,260
You okay?

197
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Did they hurt you?

198
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,960
No. 

199
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,230
They just wanted me present

200
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,700
while they broadcast an announcement. 

201
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,700
They're going to put me on trial. 

202
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,730
For what?

203
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,900
Crimes against humanity. 

204
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,230
That's ridiculous. When?

205
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,530
Less than three hours. 

206
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,800
Dad, I'm sure that Jack and the President

207
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,100
are doing everything they can to find us. 

208
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
Maybe they'll get here before then. 

209
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,200
I can deal with anything

210
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,100
these bastards have got for me. 

211
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,060
I wish you hadn't come this morning, that's all. 

212
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,430
This is a list of the offenses

213
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,560
you are being charged with. 

214
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,930
Sign it. 

215
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,700
I'm a senior member of the United States government. 

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
I'm not signing it. 

217
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,430
Then you will die,  Mr. Secretary. 

218
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,460
Pick up the document and sign it. 

219
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,500
No!

220
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,530
Let her go. 

221
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,230
Leave her alone, you son

222
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,760
of a bitch. Come on! Leave her alone. 

223
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,460
Kill her!

224
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,800
All right. 

225
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,230
All right! I'll sign it!

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,230
Pick up the document. 

227
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
Pick it up. 

228
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,540
- Where are we on finding Bauer?  - So far nowhere. 

229
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,910
- That's unacceptable.  - There are a lot of places he could be. 

230
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,310
We're working up everything we can. 

231
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,540
What else are you doing to find Heller?

232
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,840
After I'm done here

233
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,580
I'm going to find out what his son Richard knows. 

234
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,650
Sarah's working on the forensics from the kidnapping. 

235
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,290
- Have you gotten anything new yet?  - No. 

236
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,390
- Great, what else?  - Sarah Gavin. 

237
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,560
- We're trying to trace the origin of the terrorist web cast.  - And?

238
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,690
The code's been braided, and I can't get into the system file. 

239
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,860
In other words, nothing. 

240
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,270
Ms. Driscoll,  it's the President. 

241
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,640
Make something happen. 

242
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,410
Yes, Mr. President. 

243
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,380
I understand you lost one of your field operatives. 

244
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,720
Yes, we did. 

245
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,790
Did the engagement yield any witnesses or prisoners?

246
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,820
Not yet, but there's some hope. 

247
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,290
Tell me. 

248
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,460
Jack Bauer, who as you know used to work here, 

249
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,170
is currently in the field trailing a suspect. 

250
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,000
Trailing him?

251
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,440
Why doesn't he bring him in?

252
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,140
We're in the process of doing that, sir. 

253
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,540
Erin, 

254
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,950
are we going to be able to save Jim and his daughter

255
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,850
before this... trial starts?

256
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,550
I certainly hope so, sir. 

257
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,720
Mr. President, I have to ask you something now

258
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,560
because we may not have time later. 

259
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,060
What is it?

260
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,430
We may find ourselves in a situation

261
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,470
where we have Heller's location but can't extract him safely. 

262
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,270
If that's the case, 

263
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,380
would you authorize, in advance, 

264
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,810
an all-out assault?

265
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,520
The assumption being that the Secretary would not survive?

266
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,760
Correct. 

267
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,290
We'll cross that bridge if the scenario presents itself. 

268
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,960
Yes, sir. 

269
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,130
Good-bye, Erin. 

270
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,380
Manning. 

271
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,880
Hey, Curtis. It's Maryanne. 

272
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,980
Look, I know you're busy with the Heller kidnapping. 

273
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,380
Yes, I am. 

274
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,920
My friend Aileen said you're calling in

275
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,690
level-five consultants today because you're overloaded there. 

276
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,760
We added some personnel because of the crisis. 

277
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,390
She said you struck my name from the list. 

278
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,690
Why?

279
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,500
You don't meet the criteria, Maryanne. 

280
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
Don't give me that, Curtis. 

281
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,900
I have the qualifications and I have the clearance. 

282
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,000
Why'd you exclude me?

283
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,610
All right, you want it straight?

284
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,480
I don't think we'd work very well together. 

285
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,580
Why? Because we slept together a few times

286
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,980
and you stopped calling me?

287
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,180
I stopped calling you

288
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,380
because I realized you were using me

289
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,450
to get ahead in your career. 

290
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,920
That's your interpretation, Curtis. 

291
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,290
And you didn't seem to have a problem with it at the time. 

292
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm not going to have this conversation. 

293
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,830
Fine, I'll have it with Erin Driscoll. 

294
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,570
- Maryanne...  - Consulting with CTU would be a huge opportunity

295
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,870
for me, Curtis. 

296
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,100
And I'm not going to let you get in the way

297
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,840
because you're uncomfortable. 

298
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,050
Where should I post those FBI bulletins?

299
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,620
At two-three. 

300
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,870
O'Brian. 

301
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,140
Chloe, it's me. Can you talk?

302
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,810
Jack, what the hell happened with Andrew?

303
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,910
Someone got to him

304
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,010
before we could pick him up. 

305
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,380
Did you tell anyone at CTU

306
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,080
- where we were supposed to meet him?  - No. 

307
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,120
What are you doing,  Jack?

308
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,350
Driscoll just announced

309
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,950
you're operating outside her authority. 

310
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
I don't have a choice, 

311
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,390
she's not handling this the right way. 

312
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,930
- What if you're wrong?  - I'm not. 

313
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,760
This is the best chance we have of finding Secretary Heller. 

314
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,430
Jack, if anything happens to Andrew... 

315
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,970
Chloe, I'm doing the best I can, 

316
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,100
but right now our first priority is to find these terrorists. 

317
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,010
So why are you calling me?

318
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,710
The hostile's headed towards the canyons. 

319
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,310
I'm going to need satellite surveillance

320
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,980
to help me track them without being seen. 

321
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,020
You want me to steal satellite bandwidth from CTU, 

322
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,220
- without anyone knowing?  - Yes. 

323
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,520
Where are you?

324
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,190
I'm on Orchard Road just north of the 14

325
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,030
about four miles east of Valencia. 

326
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay, Caltrans has traffic cams in the area, 

327
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,570
but you will need satellite coverage

328
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,100
once he gets closer to the canyons. 

329
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,210
Call me back as soon as you've got the coverage. 

330
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,780
- I'll keep a private channel open.  - I will. 

331
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,950
Who was that?

332
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,020
It was personal. 

333
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,690
Something wrong?

334
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,860
I'm not sure. 

335
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,800
Chloe's acting kind of strange. 

336
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,500
That's nothing new. 

337
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,890
Hey, what do you need?

338
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,290
I just got off the phone

339
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,260
with Maryanne Taylor. 

340
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,790
Erin, whatever she told you, 

341
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,600
it's coming from a very disturbed place. 

342
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,900
That may be. 

343
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,800
But she's as qualified as any of the others

344
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,040
you brought in today. 

345
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,610
I'm not comfortable working with her. 

346
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,680
That should be enough for you. 

347
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,880
Normally it would be. 

348
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,950
However, she mentioned that your pillow talk

349
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,320
included a synopsis of the new data mining protocols. 

350
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,650
That's a lie. 

351
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,290
If she got that information, 

352
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,690
it was from someone else. 

353
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,330
Now she's using it against me. 

354
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,030
She knows details about the new UVX system. 

355
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,970
That's classified information. 

356
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
She could force us into a section one security reboot

357
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,040
and drag us through a six-month investigation. 

358
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,140
I don't believe this. 

359
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,610
I asked her to come in. 

360
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,380
Deal with it. 

361
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,160
Do you have the results on Secretary Heller's son yet?

362
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,360
Yeah. 

363
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
The polygraph makes clear he didn't have any

364
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,270
knowing involvement in his father's kidnapping. 

365
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,110
But...?

366
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,170
He's still insisting

367
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,580
he didn't tell anyone

368
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,110
his father was coming to his house this morning. 

369
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,120
The polygraph was inconclusive on that claim. 

370
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,650
You think he's lying?

371
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,790
It's possible. 

372
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,320
Richard was the only one who knew

373
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,160
where his father would be this morning. 

374
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,090
And he may have told someone about it. 

375
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,430
Why would Richard protect somebody who's betrayed him?

376
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,000
Because he's too arrogant to believe that's what's happened. 

377
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,310
It'll take days to go through

378
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,610
his phone records. 

379
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,920
I want you to see

380
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,850
if you can get the name out of him another way. 

381
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,190
What do you mean?

382
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,390
You know what I mean. 

383
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,600
Erin, we're not even sure if he's guilty of anything. 

384
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,470
This is how we'll find out. 

385
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,670
Get started. 

386
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,600
Did Father talk to you about Debbie?

387
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,970
What about her?

388
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,480
When Dad told me to take the briefcase to Omar... 

389
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,720
Debbie followed me. 

390
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,920
She didn't know where I was going. 

391
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,590
She just wanted to talk. 

392
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,260
Debbie saw the warehouse where we're holding Heller?

393
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,700
Yes. 

394
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,660
But there wasn't anything I could do about it. 

395
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,100
You could have broken up with her months ago

396
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,110
like your father and I told you to. 

397
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,340
I know I made a mistake, 

398
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,880
but Father found out she was with me

399
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,780
and now he wants me to get her over here. 

400
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,680
You know what that means. 

401
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,920
If he thinks

402
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,420
there's the slightest chance

403
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,290
she could expose what we're doing... 

404
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,700
I didn't realize you felt so strongly about her. 

405
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,640
She's not going

406
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,210
to mess anything up, I swear to you. 

407
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,350
What do you want me to do?

408
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,290
Talk to him. 

409
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,190
He'll listen to you. 

410
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,320
Please. 

411
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,160
Okay. 

412
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,870
Your father's on his way to a meeting. 

413
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
I'll try to reach him. 

414
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,080
Thanks, Mom. 

415
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,880
When can I get out of here?

416
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,480
Secure him. 

417
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,410
What the hell are you doing?!

418
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,010
Get your hands off me!

419
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,580
Who else knew your father

420
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,350
would be at your house this morning?

421
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,780
I told you, no one. 

422
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,780
What, are you crazy?

423
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,080
This works on the neurotransmitter level. 

424
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,110
It makes every nerve ending in your body

425
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,450
feel like it's on fire. 

426
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,680
You're bluffing. 

427
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,710
You know you can't get away with this. 

428
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,080
And by the time you're released, 

429
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,510
the mark on your arm will be gone. 

430
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,080
It'll just be your word against mine. 

431
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,250
My father is the Secretary of Defense, for God's sake. 

432
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,780
I thought you hated him. 

433
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,180
Now he's dear old dad?

434
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,080
Help me!

435
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,480
Somebody!

436
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,850
Please!

437
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,280
Help me!

438
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,410
Stop. 

439
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,210
I can't do it, Erin. 

440
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,750
I'm not going to let Eric work on Richard Heller. 

441
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,250
- Why not?  - Maybe he's protecting a friend, 

442
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,210
but he wasn't knowingly involved with the terrorist. 

443
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,280
It's an inappropriate use of force. 

444
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,380
I gave you an order. 

445
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,910
Then give it to me in writing, Erin. 

446
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,510
What are you suggesting, Curtis, 

447
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,010
- that we release him?  - No. 

448
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,750
I've seen good results with sensory disorientation. 

449
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,150
Cut off his sight,  saturate his auditory. 

450
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,850
It's noninvasive. 

451
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,450
Fine. 

452
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,480
Try it. 

453
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,080
Yes?

454
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,610
I just spoke with Behrooz. 

455
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,450
He told me about the problem with his girlfriend. 

456
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,610
He's very upset, Navi. 

457
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,850
That's what concerns me. 

458
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,850
He has feelings for this girl, despite what he tells us. 

459
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,450
Now she's seen the warehouse. 

460
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,580
I know. 

461
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,910
It's very troubling. 

462
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,380
I told him to get her over to the house

463
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,380
so we can question her. Did he make the call?

464
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,710
No, he asked me to talk to you instead. 

465
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,980
Hmm. 

466
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,380
Go upstairs. 

467
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,680
What are we going to do?

468
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,080
Are you talking to Father?

469
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,480
I'll talk to you soon. 

470
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,350
You'll take care of this?

471
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,380
Yes. 

472
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,150
Thank you. 

473
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,610
What did he say?

474
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,380
Do I still have to call Debbie and get her over here?

475
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,010
No. 

476
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,850
Thank you, Mom. 

477
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,680
I'm going to pull over soon, and we're going to talk, 

478
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,580
okay?

479
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,880
Good. 

480
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,510
There's some things I need you to know. 

481
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,510
Today is not about me or you. 

482
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,510
It's about something bigger. 

483
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,050
What I need to know with certainty, 

484
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,080
is that whatever you saw on the Internet

485
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,310
will not interfere with what we have planned. 

486
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,980
You have to convince me of that. 

487
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,180
Yeah?

488
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,780
It's going to be a while on the satellite. 

489
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,110
Ever since Heller was taken,  the load is through the roof. 

490
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,780
- How much longer?  - I'm not sure yet. 

491
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,650
What is your current position exactly?

492
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,310
I need it to update the request. 

493
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,680
Suspect pulled over just past mile marker 31. 

494
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,510
What did he get off for? There's nothing there. 

495
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,510
I don't know, Chloe. I've got to go!

496
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,050
Get back to me as soon as you've got the satellite coverage. 

497
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,210
Jack, I'm watching this. 

498
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
How?

499
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,580
On Caltrans' traffic cam. 

500
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,980
You've got to stop this. 

501
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,910
If I intercede right now,  we lose our opportunity

502
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,950
to find Secretary Heller. 

503
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,250
What did you tell CTU?

504
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,310
That someone was preparing to distribute

505
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,510
some kind of positioning code on the Internet. 

506
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,680
What else?

507
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,050
I tried to dig deeper, 

508
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,680
but everything was in some kind of Arabic. 

509
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,950
I couldn't read it. 

510
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,280
That's all you told CTU?

511
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,010
Yes. I promise. 

512
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,780
Ah!

513
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,410
Are you sure?

514
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,150
Jack, stop them, just stop them. 

515
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,250
That's all I know. I swear, I promise. 

516
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,150
Please, just don't hit me anymore. 

517
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,350
Please. 

518
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,080
I talked to the programmer. 

519
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,480
I don't think there's a problem. 

520
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,610
He didn't tell CTU enough

521
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,150
for them to be able to stop us. 

522
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,750
Are you sure?

523
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,780
Yes. He only got a brief glimpse of the code. 

524
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,050
He was never logged on to our server. 

525
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,350
I need you here. Get back on the road. 

526
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,910
Have them see what else they can find out, 

527
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,810
and then get rid of the body. 

528
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,850
I will see you soon. 

529
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,980
Chloe, how do you open a secure pipe to Division?

530
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,950
Ask Edgar. 

531
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,110
I did. He's busy. 

532
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,710
Well, I'm busy, too. 

533
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,910
Why are you always so impatient with everybody?

534
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,610
Not everybody, just you. Now please go away. 

535
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,950
Bitch. 

536
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,780
Jack, what's happening?

537
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,450
The hostile's moving. I've got to follow him. 

538
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,610
Jack, you can't leave

539
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,250
Andrew there, they'll kill him. 

540
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,610
Jack?

541
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,310
Jack, please. 

542
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,880
Jack. 

543
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,350
Jack?

544
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,950
Jack?

545
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,750
Yeah. 

546
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,350
Is Andrew alive?

547
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,210
Yes. Dispatch an ambulance to this location. 

548
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,180
Get me the damn satellite coverage!

549
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,280
That's right, just off the road next to the 31-mile marker. 

550
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,350
Please get there as fast as you can. 

551
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,480
What's wrong?

552
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,890
When the trial begins, 

553
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,590
you may have an opportunity to escape. 

554
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,390
You have to take it, even if it's dangerous. 

555
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,150
Maybe we'll have a chance before then. 

556
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,890
They're never going to take their eyes off of me. 

557
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,350
It has to be when their attention

558
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,410
is on the trial. 

559
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,810
I don't want to get out of here without... 

560
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,610
Forget about me. 

561
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,350
You have to take every chance. 

562
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,210
Promise me. 

563
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,710
Dad, I I... I ca... 

564
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,470
Yes, you can. You can. 

565
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,970
I want you to live

566
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,270
your life, a full life. 

567
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,670
I want you to have a family. 

568
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,870
That's all I care about. 

569
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,500
You're my baby. 

570
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,660
I can't do it. 

571
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,360
Yes, you can. You can do it. 

572
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,460
Come on now. 

573
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,010
Chloe, you want me to get that?

574
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,280
No. 

575
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,510
O'Brian. 

576
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,910
Chloe, it's me. 

577
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,810
I was just looking at the C.H.P. dispatch report. 

578
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,970
Andrew is in really bad shape. 

579
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,710
I will never forgive you. 

580
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,040
Do you hear me?

581
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,540
Chloe, I understand how you feel, but you've

582
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
got to think through this clearly. 

583
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,340
We have terrorists on U.S. soil. 

584
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,500
They've bombed a train, and they've kidnapped

585
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,030
the Secretary of Defense. 

586
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,670
Right now our only chance is to follow this hostile and hope

587
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,300
that he leads us to Secretary Heller. 

588
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,230
No, I'm not listening to you anymore. This is over. 

589
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,030
- I'm going to Driscoll. No, you won't.  - Chloe, because you know I'm right. 

590
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,930
No, I don't. 

591
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,190
Chloe, if you didn't believe in what I was doing, 

592
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
you'd have turned me in already. 

593
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,580
I hate that this is happening. 

594
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,920
So do I. 

595
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,380
Chloe, I can't do this without you. 

596
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,380
I need your help to stop them. 

597
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,380
Chloe. 

598
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,550
What?

599
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,910
Are you with me?

600
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,410
Yeah. 

601
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,710
I'll call you as soon as I have the satellite. 

602
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,140
Thank you. 

603
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,810
Yeah. 

604
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,470
Miss Driscoll, 

605
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,860
this is Maryanne Taylor. 

606
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,830
- Thank you.  - Hi, Miss Taylor. 

607
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,260
I'm very excited to have this opportunity to help you here. 

608
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,290
Hello, Curtis. 

609
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,630
Maryanne. 

610
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,490
Curtis, take Maryanne to an empty station, 

611
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,730
and get her started

612
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,360
on the data sorts. 

613
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,220
Let's go. 

614
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,420
You'll be working over here. 

615
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,450
You know, Curtis, I didn't want

616
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,580
to go over your head, but you left me no choice. 

617
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,510
Is that so?

618
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,680
I'll let it go if you will. 

619
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,880
Get to work, Maryanne. 

620
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,100
Is there a problem?

621
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,500
No. Why?

622
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,870
What are you working on?

623
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,000
Division protocol manifest. 

624
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,860
I need you to build a firewall around station four. 

625
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,460
Who's that?

626
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,530
Her name is Maryanne. 

627
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,330
I just want to make sure

628
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,460
she doesn't stray outside

629
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,430
the area of her assignment. 

630
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,590
Fine. 

631
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,020
- O'Brian.  - Chloe, what's going on? 

632
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,820
I don't think I can do this, Jack. 

633
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,820
Why, what's the matter?

634
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,960
Curtis has me spread too thin, 

635
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,950
and I've got to get you a satellite

636
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,190
on an overloaded system. 

637
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,950
I need more time. We don't have more time. 

638
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,950
In five minutes we're going to be coming up

639
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,480
on Route 11. It's a two-lane road. 

640
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,620
We'll be the only cars for miles. 

641
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,320
There's no way I can follow him

642
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,450
without being seen. 

643
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,350
All right. I think I know

644
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,950
a way I can speed this up. 

645
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,210
I'll get back to you. 

646
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,300
Chloe, the satellite subsystem tanked

647
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,430
and Driscoll wants these updates, like, now. 

648
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,290
Okay, I'll be right there. 

649
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,360
I hope Driscoll doesn't get too upset. 

650
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,560
She really overreacts sometimes. 

651
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,350
Oh, this happened to me a few days ago. 

652
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,990
You can retrieve all your files

653
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,150
from the auto backups in the server room. 

654
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,390
Good idea. 

655
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,690
Yeah?

656
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,350
All right, I managed to steal you a block of time, 

657
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,220
but there's no continuous coverage

658
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,450
in the area you're in. 

659
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,280
I'll have to order a reposition. 

660
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,380
Fine, then do it. Hold on. 

661
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,420
Looks like we're catching a break. 

662
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,450
He's pulling into a gas station. 

663
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,980
I hope he stays there a while, 

664
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,980
'cause this is going to take some time. 

665
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,580
Get back to me as soon as you got it. 

666
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,910
Okay, I will. 

667
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,460
- You're Edgar, right?  - Yeah. 

668
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,760
Hi, I'm Maryanne Taylor. 

669
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,130
Erin Driscoll asked me to come in

670
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,270
and help on data logistics. 

671
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, I heard something about that. Hi. 

672
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,730
Hi. So, um, can you do me a favor?

673
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,700
A favor?

674
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,270
Yeah, you know, everyone's really busy

675
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,840
and I just feel like I'd be more useful

676
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,540
if I had an overall on what's going on today. 

677
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,310
The Secretary of Defense has been kidnapped. 

678
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,970
I know that. I mean tactically. 

679
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,810
I really don't have time for this. I'm a little busy. 

680
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,210
Why don't you just give me

681
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,480
the main points, okay?

682
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,940
All right, we think Jack Bauer

683
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,680
is following one of the terrorists. 

684
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,510
- We think?  - Yeah, it's a little loose right now. 

685
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,720
He's off on his own doing this, and we can't find him. 

686
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,550
I thought Bauer didn't even work here anymore. 

687
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,980
He doesn't. 

688
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,720
Driscoll gave him the authority to do this one thing. 

689
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,250
All right. 

690
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,050
Thanks, Edgar. 

691
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,610
Richard... 

692
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,450
how long do you think it's been?

693
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,980
What?

694
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,590
How long do you think you've been sitting here like this?

695
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,360
Three, four hours. 

696
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,260
It's been less than 30 minutes. 

697
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,200
Time is the first thing you lose track of

698
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,500
with sensory disorientation. 

699
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,030
And it only gets worse. 

700
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,430
This is illegal!

701
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,070
You can't keep me here. 

702
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,140
You'll be here until you tell me what I need to know. 

703
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,040
I told you everything I know!

704
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,170
Your father was kidnapped by terrorists. 

705
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,810
Our polygraph analysis tells us that you're hiding something

706
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,110
that might help us find him. 

707
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,610
Just tell me what it is

708
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,310
and all this stops. 

709
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,510
You're not going to do this. 

710
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,210
If you don't care enough about your father

711
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,480
to tell me what I need to know, 

712
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,210
I'll get it out of you this way. 

713
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,490
You're not going to do this!

714
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,890
Please!

715
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,590
No!

716
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,990
You're not going to do this!

717
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,900
Stop it! Stop it!

718
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,260
O'Brian. 

719
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,860
What's your time frame on the reposition?

720
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,630
Suspect's going to be headed back out on the road

721
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,490
any minute. My request's still in the queue. 

722
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,500
Chloe, we've got to get that satellite coverage up and running now. 

723
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,630
There's nothing I can do. You're going to have to find

724
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,530
a way to keep him from getting back on the road. 

725
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,570
- It's going to take as long as it takes.  - Just hurry. 

726
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,200
Okay, I will. 

727
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,570
Why is Debbie here?

728
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,110
What did you do?

729
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,910
I called her and asked her to come over. 

730
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,510
You said that you would help me. 

731
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,110
That you talked to Father. 

732
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,510
Your father's right. 

733
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,080
We need to find out who she told about this morning. 

734
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,050
I told you she didn't see anything!

735
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,350
Then there shouldn't be any problem. 

736
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,380
What did you say to her?

737
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,650
I told her

738
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,080
that I was concerned about the two of you

739
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,220
and that I wanted to help. 

740
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,250
Mom... 

741
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,290
Behrooz, 

742
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,590
you know what's at stake. 

743
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,060
You do as you're told, understand?

744
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,030
Debbie, thank you for coming. 

745
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,030
Sure. 

746
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,730
Hi. 

747
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,370
Come in. 

748
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,840
Debbie, please. 

749
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,410
Make yourself comfortable in the living room. 

750
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,710
I'll make tea. 

751
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,780
- Hi.  - Hey. 

752
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,980
I'm glad your mom called. 

753
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,580
If she and your dad have problems

754
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,950
with us being together, we should talk about it. 

755
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,780
Debbie... 

756
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,950
What's wrong?

757
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,580
You don't understand. 

758
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,650
You shouldn't have come here. 

759
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,150
Why do you always say things like that?

760
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,610
Damn it. 

761
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,570
O'Brian. 

762
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,480
Chloe, what's your bottom line? Am I going to have

763
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,310
satellite coverage in the next minute or two?

764
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,410
I'm sorry, Jack. 

765
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,010
It's going to take at least another five. 

766
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,780
That's too long. That's the best I can do. 

767
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,880
Damn it. I'm going to have to figure out a way to keep this guy here. 

768
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,080
Keep working on it. Okay, I will. 

769
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


770
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,080
In three hours,

2
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,550
Heller will be tried for war crimes against humanity.

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,980
If he is proven guilty,

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,750
he will be executed in accordance with our laws.

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,250
When the trial begins,

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,950
you may have an opportunity to escape.

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,650
You have to take it,

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,750
even if it's dangerous.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,310
When Dad told me to take the briefcase to Omar,

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,450
Debbie followed me.

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,980
Debbie saw the warehouse

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,980
where we're holding Heller?

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,480
Yes. But father found out she was with me,

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,110
and now he wants me to get her over here.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,880
You know what that means.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,310
Debbie, thank you for coming.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,810
Sure.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,510
I need you to build a fire wall

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,610
around Station Four.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,610
Who's that?

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Her name's Maryanne.

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,910
I just want to make sure

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,010
she doesn't stray outside

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,410
- the area of her assignment.  - Fine.

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,150
Listen to me. The terrorists have just announced

26
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,350
that they are going to try

27
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,780
and execute Heller in less than three hours.

28
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,280
Bring the man in now.

29
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,650
I don't think that's the right call.

30
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,280
I believe that if I follow them, they're going to lead me

31
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,980
to Secretary Heller and the men who kidnapped him.

32
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,680
Jack Bauer is no longer cooperating

33
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,980
with this investigation.

34
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,150
All departments need to be working on the location

35
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,410
and capture of Jack Bauer

36
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,650
and the hostile that he's tracking now.

37
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,680
Right now, our first priority is to find these terrorists.

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,180
I'm going to need satellite surveillance

39
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,610
to help me track them without being seen.

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,980
You want me to steal

41
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,310
satellite bandwidth from CTU without anyone knowing?

42
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,650
Yes.

43
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,480
Am I going to have satellite coverage

44
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,380
in the next minute or two?

45
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,610
I'm sorry, Jack.

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,280
It's going to take at least another five.

47
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,380
I'm going to have to figure out a way to keep this guy here.

48
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,750
Keep working on it.

49
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,780
Everybody put your hands up now. You... don't move!

50
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,050
Slowly, move back to the corner.

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,550
Everybody just stay calm.

52
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,610
You'll be out of here

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
before you know it.

54
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,810
You...

55
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,680
hop up on the counter, 

56
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,680
black out that camera.

57
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,710
Anybody else working in the back?

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,180
Put your hands up.

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,380
Move over there with the others.

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,110
Now!

61
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,980
You have any IDs on the other two?

62
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,610
I don't know yet.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,950
If I did, I'd tell you.

64
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,410
I'll keep you updated.

65
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Thank you. Yeah, please do.

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,950
Briefing in five minutes.

67
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,110
County just reported that Andrew Paige

68
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,650
was taken into their ER in critical condition.

69
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,480
Paige? The programmer Jack

70
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,810
went to pick up?

71
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,350
That's not all.

72
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,650
The bodies of two unidentified Middle Eastern men

73
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,550
were found at the site, gunshot wounds.

74
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,550
Bauer must have done that to save the kid.

75
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,010
Where did they find all this?

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,350
Moore Park.

77
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,180
It's getting out of control.

78
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,450
We lose an agent, 

79
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,410
now one of our only witnesses has been disabled.

80
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,850
What about the hostile and Bauer?

81
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,650
Still at large.

82
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,850
All right. We have less than three hours

83
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,610
before Heller is executed in front of the country.

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,010
Maybe we shouldn't concentrate everything on Bauer, 

85
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,150
and pursue other leads.

86
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,710
Except for Heller's son, we have

87
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,110
no other leads. I want all tactical teams

88
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,380
working on finding Bauer and the hostile.

89
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,580
You got it.

90
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,210
Keep moving back towards the corner.

91
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,380
Move!

92
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,880
Everybody get down on the ground.

93
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,910
Lady, get down on the floor!

94
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
- Take it easy.  - Shut up!

95
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,080
You want to get through this, lady, 

96
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,410
you listen to me. You understand?

97
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,410
Get down on the floor now!

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,080
I want your wallets and your cell phones.

99
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,850
Make it quick.

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,850
Where's your cell phone?

101
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,850
I don't have one.

102
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,750
Where's your cell phone?

103
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,610
What's this?

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,510
- You some kind of cop?  - No.

105
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,850
What do you need this for?

106
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,910
Protection.

107
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,680
I get my money, no one gets hurt.

108
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,480
Do I make myself clear?

109
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,010
You, in the cap. What's your name?

110
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,310
Doug.

111
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,480
Doug, give me your keys.

112
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,210
Which one of these opens the front door?

113
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,910
- Which one!?  - The brass one.

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,610
Hi. I'm sorry. We've got an electrical problem

115
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,550
with the store. We're closed right now.

116
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,350
I just need a pack of cigarettes.

117
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,810
I'm sorry. You're going to have to go

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,310
to the gas station across the street.

119
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,780
Thank you.

120
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,250
O'Brian.

121
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,280
The satellite up yet?

122
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,510
No. I have to reposition

123
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,850
without Driscoll noticing.

124
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,850
Where are you?

125
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,210
I'm at a Mercury Mart in Solmas.

126
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,350
I had to stage a robbery

127
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,680
- to keep the hostile in place.  - What?

128
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,080
It was the only way I could stop him

129
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,280
from getting back on the road.

130
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,250
How much longer?

131
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,450
It's going to take ten minutes.

132
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,450
Son of a bitch.

133
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,410
Chloe, please hurry.

134
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,950
- I'll get back to you.  - Chloe?

135
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,380
Driscoll's called a briefing.

136
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,110
I'll be there in a couple minutes.

137
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,510
Chloe, now.

138
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,210
Where you going?

139
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,580
To a briefing.

140
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,680
Should I be in there?

141
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,010
No.

142
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,650
Hi. I'm Maryanne. I'm helping out today.

143
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,950
Okay.

144
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,150
And you are?

145
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,250
This is Chloe O'Brian, 

146
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,750
our senior sys tech.

147
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,050
She doesn't have time to chat either, Maryanne.

148
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,110
It's nice to meet you, Chloe.

149
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,010
As some of you know, about an hour ago, 

150
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,250
a hostile abducted a witness in this case...

151
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,110
- Andrew Paige.  - Do we have any idea

152
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,510
where this hostile is now?

153
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,950
No, but we have general direction of travel.

154
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,150
County Emergency Services just called this in.

155
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,110
His best route of escape is the freeway.

156
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,750
He'll likely dump his vehicle

157
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,880
and try to hijack another one.

158
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,510
This is Andrew Paige.

159
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,050
He was apparently tortured, and about to be killed,

160
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,410
when, it seems, Jack Bauer intervened.

161
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,680
Assuming this took place in the last half hour, 

162
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,250
and that the hostile was continuing east, he's somewhere

163
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,280
in the northeastern corridor of Ventura County.

164
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,480
We'll coordinate with Caltrans, 

165
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,810
CHP and Ventura Sheriff to set up watch points.

166
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I want every available resource on this. Edgar, 

167
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,980
take the lead in satellite positioning.

168
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,750
Sara, you'll coordinate with NSA.

169
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,780
That's all, thank you.

170
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,950
Chloe?

171
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,780
I'm sorry about Andrew.

172
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,150
I know he was a friend of yours.

173
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,550
They said there's a good chance

174
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,680
that he'll pull through.

175
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,410
Thanks.

176
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,450
And, Chloe, there's nothing

177
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,180
you could have done.

178
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,580
I want you to put a pipeline on Chloe's system.

179
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,580
What for?

180
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,050
She knew about Andrew Paige.

181
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,110
How do you know that?

182
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,650
Her reactions.

183
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,310
Which means she's been in touch with Jack Bauer.

184
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,080
Well, I'll need her access code.

185
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,850
Doug!

186
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,250
Get over here now!

187
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,950
Open the safe.

188
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,910
That's it? Yeah.

189
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,280
Why don't you take it and leave?

190
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,880
I won't say anything to the police.

191
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,080
When does your armored truck make its pickup?

192
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,380
About 12:30.

193
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,880
What, you want to rob the armored truck, too?

194
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,910
Shut up. Get back in the corner.

195
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Move!

196
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,180
Is he going to keep us here another two hours?

197
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,410
We have to do something to stop him.

198
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,210
Damn it.

199
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Something is wrong.

200
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,510
Kaleel is not answering his phone.

201
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Maybe he's out of range.

202
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,710
No. Not for this long.

203
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,980
Check with our people in the area.

204
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,810
Find out if anything has happened to him.

205
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,050
Kaleel may not be here in time.

206
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,710
We'll have to start booting up the routers without him.

207
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,210
Take care of it.

208
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,550
Let my daughter go.

209
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,250
You don't need her.

210
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,410
She has already been useful.

211
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,750
Please.

212
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,210
I'll do whatever you want.

213
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,580
I know you will.

214
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,610
That's why we are keeping her.

215
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,880
I don't care if you kill me.

216
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,180
But if you kill her, even your own people

217
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,810
will see you as a barbaric pig.

218
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,780
Is this what your religion teaches you?

219
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,280
Dad. Dad.

220
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,780
Calm down.

221
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,280
You all right?

222
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,980
I'm fine.

223
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,910
Where's your medication?

224
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,080
Your nitroglycerin.

225
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,310
Where is it?

226
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,580
I left it in the car.

227
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,650
My father has a heart condition.

228
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,450
He needs his medication.

229
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,350
Any indication Chloe's been in contact with Bauer?

230
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,210
No.

231
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,580
Keep watching.

232
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,910
This is Edgar Stiles.

233
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,910
Edgar, it's Chloe.

234
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,050
Why are you calling me?

235
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,610
I need to talk to you in private.

236
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Meet me in Archives.

237
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,610
- When?  - Now.

238
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Why are we meeting like this? I'm busy.

239
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,780
Edgar, I need you to help me.

240
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,850
Help you with what?

241
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,150
Sara piped in to my system.

242
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,250
Why would she do that?

243
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,780
Driscoll must have asked her to, 

244
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,510
otherwise she wouldn't even have access.

245
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,910
Well, if Driscoll's spying on ya, 

246
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,310
I'm sure she's got a good reason.

247
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,450
I'm not getting involved.

248
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,080
I've been in contact with Jack Bauer.

249
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,410
What?!

250
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,880
That's right, now you're involved.

251
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,210
So you're either going to help me or you're going

252
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,610
to turn me in. I'm turning you in.

253
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,050
Jack can find Heller if he's allowed

254
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,150
to follow the hostile, but Driscoll won't let him.

255
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,480
That's her call.

256
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,050
She's wrong.

257
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,180
That's your opinion.

258
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,850
These decisions are not ours to make.

259
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,010
How about if you do it as a favor to me?

260
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,010
How many times have I helped you

261
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,480
since you started here?

262
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,810
A lot.

263
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,380
What about the first two weeks

264
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,080
when I had to do all your work

265
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,610
for you because you were too nervous?

266
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,080
You owe me.

267
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,210
You're asking me to do something that can get me fired.

268
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,510
Not if I say I ordered you to do it.

269
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,080
Remember, I outrank you.

270
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,050
I'd take the heat.

271
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,880
What do I have to do?

272
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,380
I need to reposition the satellite for Jack, 

273
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,750
and I need to do it now.

274
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,550
Since Sarah's piping my system, 

275
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,380
we have to use yours.

276
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,480
Okay.

277
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,010
Send it to Archives Three.

278
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,780
Transfer my calls there.

279
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,880
I want to know who's in charge here.

280
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,080
I want to speak

281
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,280
to the man who was just in here.

282
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,550
You'll speak to him later.

283
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,950
No, now!

284
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,180
I am the Secretary of Defense

285
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,410
of the United States of America.

286
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,010
You will listen to me!

287
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,410
Dad, don't make it worse.

288
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,810
What do you mean, worse?!

289
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,150
What could be worse than waiting around here

290
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,680
to be murdered by a bunch of lawless, Godless thugs?

291
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,680
Dad, calm down.

292
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,610
I don't want to calm down!

293
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,450
Don't tell me to calm down!

294
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,710
What's the point?

295
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,280
We're here, okay? The best thing we could do

296
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,510
is keep our heads, and hope that someone comes along...

297
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,510
Hope?

298
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,410
Hope that we get rescued?

299
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,410
We have to do something! We have to take...

300
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,150
Dad, what is it?

301
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,750
What's happening?

302
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,580
Okay, try to take a deep breath. I need help.

303
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,210
Look, help me, please.

304
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,850
I... I think he's having a heart attack.

305
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,410
Dad, look, you've got to lie down.

306
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,450
Lie down. You've got to...

307
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,610
Dad, are you listening to me?

308
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,780
It's okay, he's coming.

309
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,050
Step back. Hurry.

310
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,180
Move away from him.

311
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,750
You need to lie him down, please!

312
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,950
Hurry. Look...

313
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,080
Step away.

314
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,780
Go on, get out of here!

315
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,980
Still with me?

316
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,380
Yeah.

317
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,210
Let's go.

318
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,880
Go back, go back.

319
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,010
Put your weapon down, slowly.

320
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,480
Both of you, hands on your head.

321
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,750
If another one of my men dies, 

322
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,050
your daughter will be killed.

323
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,550
When the armored truck pulls up, how many men come inside?

324
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,950
Two. One stays by the door and one picks up the money.

325
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,480
They park in the front or the back?

326
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,910
In the front, by the street.

327
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,180
Come on, let's go.

328
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,410
Everybody up!

329
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,210
We're moving to the back of the store! Now!

330
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,310
Stand over there.

331
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,550
Look, the longer you keep us here...

332
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,550
Shut up!

333
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,880
Let's go!

334
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,450
You try that again and I will kill you.

335
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,850
You understand me?

336
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,080
Get up.

337
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,010
Now!

338
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,250
Move to the back of the store.

339
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,180
Damn it.

340
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,380
Everybody in the freezer now!

341
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,680
Not you.

342
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,450
Move.

343
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,280
Anybody makes a sound, 

344
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,110
I kill all of you.

345
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,250
Doug, you in there?

346
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,950
Make him go away.

347
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,150
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

348
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,380
I was in the back room.

349
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,510
How come you're closed?

350
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,650
I'm taking inventory.

351
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,750
In the middle of the day?

352
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,180
Yeah.

353
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,310
Okay, um...

354
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,480
Sure everything's all right?

355
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,610
Yeah, fine.

356
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,510
You don't look fine, Doug.

357
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,750
I'm just a little tired.

358
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,750
Thanks, Bill.

359
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,080
You mind if I use the head?

360
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,850
It's... broken.

361
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,050
Something's wrong here.

362
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,580
Now you going to tell me what it is, 

363
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,610
or do I have to come in and see for myself?

364
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,450
Don't even think about it.

365
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,350
Step inside now.

366
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,550
Move.

367
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,050
Grab that counter.

368
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,910
Doug, lock the door.

369
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,780
Give me the keys.

370
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,780
I want you to go over there, 

371
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,010
give me his gun and his radio.

372
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,350
Move, come on!

373
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,180
Take out his cuffs.

374
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,410
Officer, put your hands behind your back.

375
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,680
Cuff him.

376
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,510
Go back to the freezer.

377
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,210
Let's go.

378
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,570
At this time, we have no more information

379
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,970
regarding the kidnapping

380
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,000
of Secretary of Defense James Heller

381
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,440
and his daughter Audrey

382
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,370
other than the image you are now seeing, which was...

383
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,700
My husband and I realize we've been unfair to you.

384
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,670
We've treated you as badly

385
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,400
as we have been treated ourselves, 

386
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,970
by certain ignorant people.

387
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,240
Well, it was pretty obvious

388
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,140
you didn't approve of us going out.

389
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,000
Is that okay to say?

390
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,070
Yeah, it's okay.

391
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,040
Well, we hope you'll accept our apology.

392
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,970
That means a lot to me.

393
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,370
That said, 

394
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,100
there's something else I want to discuss with you.

395
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,000
What's that?

396
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,570
This morning, you followed Behrooz

397
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,600
to his father's warehouse.

398
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,900
Oh.

399
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:12,670
Um... I thought Behrooz was seeing someone else.

400
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,940
I got jealous.

401
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,500
Oh, I understand.

402
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,070
But Mr. Araz moved his inventory there

403
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,570
because he's been robbed a few times.

404
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
And we've been trying to keep that place secret

405
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,970
so it doesn't happen again.

406
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,500
I promise I won't tell anyone where it is.

407
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,870
Good.

408
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,900
And you haven't told anyone yet?

409
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,240
No.

410
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,000
I haven't talked to anyone but Behrooz today.

411
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,140
Well, then that's settled.

412
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,040
Thank you for inviting me here, Mrs. Araz.

413
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,300
It's my pleasure.

414
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,040
Has Behrooz ever shown you pictures

415
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,340
from when he was a child?

416
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,270
No.

417
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,240
Show her, Behrooz.

418
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,500
Have a look at these.

419
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,900
I'll be right back.

420
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,900
Oh, my God.

421
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,370
That's not you.

422
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,240
It is.

423
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,240
You were so cute.

424
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,600
Thank you, Hannah.

425
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,870
You're welcome.

426
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,100
Have you been following this, Mr. Araz?

427
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,900
Yes, it's horrible.

428
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,870
It makes it so difficult

429
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,300
for the rest of us

430
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,270
when people from home do these unspeakable things.

431
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,340
I agree.

432
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
Yes.

433
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,440
The girl didn't tell anyone.

434
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,870
Are you sure? Yes.

435
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,640
Good. It'll be taken care of, then?

436
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,070
Soon.

437
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,240
Have Behrooz do it.

438
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,500
He created this problem.

439
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,300
He should be responsible for solving it himself.

440
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,370
I agree.

441
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,770
I'll call you when it's done.

442
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Thank you.

443
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,340
2-Charles-Nine. This is Station Four.

444
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,840
There's a 2-11 in progress

445
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,770
at 2221 Mill Road, cross street Cedar.

446
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,900
Two males seen leaving bank with shotguns.

447
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,970
Respond Code Three.

448
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,170
Two-Charles-Nine. Do you copy?

449
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,770
Stand back from the door!

450
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,340
Step back!

451
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
Two-Charles-Nine. Do you copy?

452
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,940
You...

453
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,500
Are you Unit Nine?

454
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,900
Yeah.

455
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,700
You tell them you're on your way.

456
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,300
One wrong word and I will kill you.

457
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,700
Now.

458
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,300
Two-Charles-Nine...

459
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,940
Help! We're being robbed!

460
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,340
Two-Charles-Nine. We have help on the way.

461
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,070
Get up, now.

462
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,200
Now's your time to let us go before the cops get here.

463
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,370
Shut up.

464
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,670
These people are your responsibility.

465
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,070
You'd better start talking to them.

466
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,740
Sara, 

467
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,470
has Chloe had any contact with Bauer yet?

468
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,770
No.

469
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,100
What about the work she's doing?

470
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,170
Could it be on his behalf?

471
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,100
No. I've been watching her system.

472
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,800
Chloe is not stupid.

473
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,970
Assume she's taking measures to protect herself.

474
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,140
Maybe she's co-opted the help of someone else inside.

475
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,940
I'm not quite sure how much of my time

476
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,100
you want me to devote to this, Miss Driscoll.

477
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,370
I expect you to be able to walk and chew gum

478
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,600
at the same time, Sara.

479
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,970
Chloe's loyal to Bauer.

480
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,800
There's a good chance that she's helping him.

481
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,840
Find out how.

482
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,140
What are you doing?

483
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,870
That looks like a satellite screen.

484
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,900
It was. I mean, it is.

485
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,040
A satellite for what?

486
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,970
We're trying to find Bauer, remember?

487
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,270
Division's already doing that.

488
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
I'm just going over what they're doing.

489
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,470
Sometimes they miss data.

490
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,370
Do they know that you're doing that?

491
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,640
Yeah, they know what I'm doing.

492
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,640
Here, call them if you don't believe me.

493
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,800
Relax, Edgar.

494
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,940
I don't have to call anybody.

495
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Do what you have to do.

496
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,400
I will.

497
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,470
Do me a favor?

498
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,570
There's a chance that Jack might try to contact Chloe.

499
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,300
If you see or hear anything, call me, okay?

500
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,670
Why would Jack try to contact Chloe?

501
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,470
He just might. Let me know.

502
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,500
Sure.

503
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,570
Edgar Stiles.

504
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,740
Edgar, what did she want?

505
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,440
She wants to nail you to the wall

506
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,740
and take a piece out of me, too.

507
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,970
Remember our deal.

508
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,500
If you get caught, you don't take me with you.

509
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,600
And if I get caught, 

510
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,140
you say you ordered me to do this.

511
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,740
You don't have to repeat the deal.

512
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,340
I'm the one who came up with it.

513
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,140
Did you reposition the satellite yet?

514
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,670
I'm working on it.

515
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,040
Leave me alone.

516
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,100
No, let them stay in the field.

517
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,240
We'll use our own people for that.

518
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Hang on, Ed.

519
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,770
Yes, what is it?

520
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Miss Driscoll, your daughter's on line two.

521
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,970
I'm busy. Tell her I'll call her back.

522
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,870
She says it's important.

523
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,170
Fine.

524
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
Ed, I'm going to have to get back to you.

525
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,840
All right.

526
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Okay, bye.

527
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,970
Maya?

528
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,870
I need you to come home.

529
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
What's wrong?

530
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,470
I'm having a bad day.

531
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,200
Sweetheart, have you been taking your medication?

532
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,370
No.

533
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
If you don't take it, 

534
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,000
you're going to feel bad.

535
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,100
Now, you know that.

536
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,970
It numbs me. I don't like it.

537
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,100
Do you like feeling like this better?

538
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,100
Come home.

539
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,800
I can't, Maya.

540
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,800
Why not?

541
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,900
Listen to me.

542
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,170
I want you to take the pills

543
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,170
and I'll call you back

544
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,370
as soon as I can, all right?

545
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,200
You promise?

546
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,170
Of course, I promise.

547
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,500
What are you going to do?

548
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,340
I'll take my pills.

549
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,770
Good.

550
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Do you love me?

551
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,870
You know I do.

552
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,540
Then why don't you say it?

553
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,400
I love you, Maya. Okay?

554
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,970
Okay.

555
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,200
All right, bye.

556
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,140
Behrooz, can I see you for a moment?

557
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,100
Yes.

558
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,400
I'll be right back.

559
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,600
Okay.

560
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,700
I talked to your father.

561
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,870
We both agree you have to be the one

562
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,400
who'll take care of this.

563
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,340
But she didn't tell anyone.

564
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,300
And we're fortunate that's the case.

565
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,740
But she still saw the warehouse

566
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,200
and she could tell the authorities about it, 

567
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,270
if she's ever brought in for questioning.

568
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,040
This is riskier than letting her live.

569
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,300
If she disappears, her mother will call the police.

570
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,200
By the time this day is over, 

571
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,940
the police will be too busy to look for a runaway girl.

572
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,670
Now take it.

573
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,640
Don't make me bring your father into this.

574
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Just take her to the basement and do it.

575
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,770
Don't think about it. Get it over

576
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,390
Behrooz.

577
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,050
Hey.

578
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,190
Everything okay?

579
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,690
Yeah.

580
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,450
I want to make a copy of this one.

581
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,250
Can I take it home and scan it?

582
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,020
Sure.

583
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,750
We need to get out of here.

584
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,520
What?

585
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,420
You're in danger.

586
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,620
Are you kidding? From who?

587
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,090
Don't ask questions, just come with me.

588
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,750
- What? Behrooz...  - Trust me, Debbie.

589
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,050
Trust me, Debbie.

590
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,990
We're okay. Come on.

591
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:58,990
I can't.

592
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,020
Why not? What's wrong?

593
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,020
I don't know.

594
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,220
Debbie?

595
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,690
Debbie, what's wrong?

596
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,690
Answer me, Debbie, what's wrong?

597
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,090
Come on, Debbie, what's wrong?

598
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,850
Get up, Debbie, we need to go, Come on.

599
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,150
- Please help me!  - Come on, Deb!

600
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,290
What's wrong, Debbie?

601
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,650
Come on, Debbie!

602
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,020
Come on. Debbie, what's wrong?

603
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,390
What did you do to her?

604
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,320
I didn't expect you to be able to do it.

605
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,550
Debbie? Debbie?

606
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,020
Come on, Debbie!

607
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,750
Debbie!

608
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,320
Give me the gun.

609
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,520
Give me the gun.

610
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,220
Hey!

611
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,020
I am so disappointed in you.

612
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Yeah.

613
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,890
This is Sergeant Dennis McGrath.

614
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,490
You know you're surrounded.

615
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,450
You should know that I've got hostages and I will kill them, 

616
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,050
if you try to use tear gas and send your men in.

617
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,950
Let's not go there yet, okay?

618
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,590
Who do you have in there?

619
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,620
The owner, two men and a woman.

620
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,420
What about Officer Datson?

621
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,790
Yeah, I've got him, too.

622
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,150
You only need one hostage to protect yourself.

623
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,350
Keep Officer Datson and let the others go.

624
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,690
I need to think about that.

625
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,050
Yeah?

626
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,290
I've got satellite coverage.

627
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,950
Okay, good.

628
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,290
The suspect will be free in about five minutes.

629
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,650
He'll be traveling on foot on Route 11.

630
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,520
I'll find him.

631
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,120
One of you is coming with me.

632
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,520
You.

633
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,720
Come here.

634
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,790
Put your hands up against the rack. Now!

635
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,350
Everybody else, to the back of the cooler.

636
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,250
Move!

637
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,550
Open the door.

638
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,050
Lock the door with the chain.

639
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,590
Now, I will let you go as soon as we are clear.

640
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,390
But if you try and be a hero again, I will kill you.

641
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,390
Do you understand me?

642
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,390
I understand.

643
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,590
Good.

644
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,490
Let's go.

645
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,620
Which car is yours?

646
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,690
The blue Lexus.

647
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,220
Unlock the door.

648
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,300
Move.

649
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,500
Tell those officers to put their weapons down

650
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,000
and take five steps back!

651
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,300
Okay, calm down.

652
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,540
We're going to try and help you through this.

653
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,100
Tell them to do it now!

654
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,740
Okay, drop your weapons and move back!

655
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,340
Stand back!

656
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,970
Do what he says. Step back.

657
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,600
Step back.

658
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,540
Come on. Come on.

659
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,840
Open the door.

660
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,170
Come on, open the driver's door.

661
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,000
You try and follow me, 

662
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,700
I will shoot him!

663
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,040
On my count, get in.

664
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,440
One, two, three, move.

665
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,500
Go! Go!

666
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,900
Call in a roadblock.

667
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,400
Suspect driving east

668
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,570
on Route 11.

669
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,940
One hostage.

670
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,970
Move the rearview mirror to the right so I can see out the back.

671
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,900
There.

672
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,200
When do you let me go?

673
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,570
When I feel like it.

674
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,070
Who are you?

675
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,700
What do you mean?

676
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,100
You don't seem like the kind of guy

677
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,540
that needs to rob a Mercury Mart.

678
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
That Mercury Mart was a money drop.

679
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,370
There was supposed to be 18 grand in that safe.

680
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,040
How do you know that?

681
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,870
We're done sharing.

682
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,070
I'm not gonna forget your face, 

683
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,340
and I've got your driver's license.

684
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,440
You talk to the police, it's not gonna be hard

685
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,140
to find you, do you understand me?

686
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,070
I won't tell them a thing.

687
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,370
Okay, pull over here.

688
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,800
Now!

689
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,500
Get out of the car.

690
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,570
Move!

691
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,000
Start running.

692
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,070
Now!

693
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,170
O'Brian.

694
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,300
You got him?

695
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,570
Yeah.

696
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,070
Good work. Now download his position on my PDA.

697
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,200
And stay reachable.

698
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,870
I will.

699
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,890
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

700
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,020
Hold on a second.

701
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,950
- Miss Driscoll?  - Yes, Sara, what is it?

702
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,050
You have a phone call from a man who says

703
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,820
he's your neighbor, a George Cliocove?

704
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,250
He says it's about your daughter.

705
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,350
- What line?  - Six.

706
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,120
George, it's Erin.

707
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,450
Erin, there's been another incident with Maya.

708
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
What's happened?

709
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,720
She came into the backyard where Evan was playing, 

710
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,420
and she started screaming at him again.

711
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,620
Is Evan okay?

712
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,520
Yes. Fortunately, I was home.

713
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,320
But this is the end, Erin.

714
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,690
I've got to protect my boy.

715
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,320
Did you call the police, George?

716
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,050
Yes, I did. They're on their way.

717
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,190
Where's Maya now?

718
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,790
She went back to your house.

719
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,290
I'm very sorry, George.

720
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,090
This will not happen again.

721
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,190
It can't, Erin.

722
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,190
Miss Driscoll, is everything all right?

723
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,150
No, it's not.

724
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,650
Is there anything I can do to help?

725
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,620
Yes.

726
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,050
I need you to call LAPD Westside and find out

727
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,050
who they dispatched to pick up my daughter.

728
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,520
She has a medical condition.

729
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,220
She suffers from schizophrenia.

730
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,820
There was an incident with one of my neighbors.

731
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,650
What would you like me to do

732
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,620
once I find out who they dispatched?

733
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,290
Tell the officers to cancel the call.

734
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,720
I'll take care of it personally.

735
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,350
Yeah, I don't think that's possible.

736
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,320
Once a call's in progress, don't they have to follow through?

737
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,150
CTU has preemptive privilege over local.

738
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,020
Yes, but that's only in a national security situation.

739
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:04,250
Sara, I'm asking you to do something.

740
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,020
Should I ask someone else?

741
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,650
No.

742
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,090
I'll do it.

743
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,350
Send a unit over to my house.

744
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,590
One medic, one field agent.

745
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,550
Bring Maya back to our clinic.

746
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,950
Yes, ma'am.

747
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,320
Thank you.

748
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,690
Yeah, I got it.

749
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,620
Thanks.

750
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,020
I found Jack Bauer.

751
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,850
Where is he?

752
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,720
In Solmas. He's still tracking the hostile, 

753
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,190
only now he's using satellite.

754
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,490
How do you know that?

755
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,990
DOD just called to complain that

756
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,990
someone over here was stealing bandwidth.

757
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,890
I took a look at the imagery and found him.

758
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,590
All right, bring them both in.

759
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,320
Who logged on to that satellite?

760
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,450
Chloe.

761
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,050
Chloe, why are you logged on

762
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,750
to an active DOD satellite?

763
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,050
All right, you're done here.

764
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,650
Whatever, I was gonna quit anyway.

765
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,790
You're not being fired. You're being arrested.

766
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,850
Call security.

767
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,850
Edgar, 

768
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,220
lock up her systems

769
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,850
and take control of all her files.

770
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,990
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,390
I want you to call Jack Bauer now.

772
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,750
Yeah.

773
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,190
Driscoll wants to talk to you.

774
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,520
What are you talking about?

775
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,520
Hello, Jack.

776
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,790
Erin... look, I've got

777
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,050
some information for you.

778
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,320
The hostile's name is Kaleel Hassein.

779
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,520
Stand down, Jack. It's over.

780
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,050
Erin, right now Hassein is free.

781
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,690
He's looking for a car and a phone.

782
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,490
Once he has those things, he's gonna lead us

783
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,090
straight to Secretary Heller, I promise.

784
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,390
You can't know that for sure.

785
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,590
What have you got to lose?

786
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,950
You've got him on satellite.

787
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,190
Just bombard the area with a receptor beacon.

788
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,990
Send a team to pick up the hostile.

789
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,550
Damn it, Erin, if you do that, everything I've done over

790
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,890
the last two hours will mean nothing!

791
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,450
I'm glad you finally figured that out.

792
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,650
Erin!

793
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,650
Take Ms. O'Brian into holding.

794
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,720
Edgar... you have it up on satellite?

795
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,620
Yeah.

796
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,550
The hostile's flagging down a car.

797
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,750
- You need some help?  - Yeah.

798
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,920
I just, uh...

799
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,720
Give me the feed down here.

800
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,120
Sara, what's the load

801
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,820
on the cell tower in that area?

802
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,190
About 40 to 50 calls.

803
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,590
Put personnel on every call. Record every call.

804
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,420
Let's see if he contacts someone.

805
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,190
- Yes?  - Omar, it's me.

806
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,320
Where have you been?

807
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,490
We've been worried.

808
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,650
Everything's fine.

809
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,820
I'll explain later.

810
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,950
Where are you?

811
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,550
I'll be there within the hour.

812
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,150
Is the broadcast on schedule?

813
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,320
Yes.

814
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,390
We're about to prepare Heller.

815
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,750
Hurry.

816
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,620
Edgar.

817
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,890
- Not now.  - Yes, 

818
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,790
now.

819
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,120
How do you feel about

820
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,120
what's happening to Chloe?

821
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,850
What do you mean?

822
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,650
She's not just gonna lose her job, 

823
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,920
she might go to prison.

824
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,350
What do you care about all this?

825
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,250
I overheard the conversation you had earlier.

826
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,590
I know you were working with her behind Driscoll's back.

827
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,350
What do you want?

828
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,190
I want to make sure I have your attention

829
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,950
whenever I need it.

830
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,950
Thanks, Robin.

831
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,890
Miss Driscoll, 

832
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,550
we got the call.

833
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,650
Put it on speaker.

834
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,820
Cue it from the top of the call.

835
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,890
Omar, it's me.

836
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,990
Where have you been? We've been worried.

837
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,320
Everything's fine. I'll explain later.

838
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,620
Where are you?

839
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,650
I'll be there within the hour.

840
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,050
- Is the broadcast on schedule?  - Yes.

841
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,550
We're about to prepare Heller.

842
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,720
Hurry.

843
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,420
Looks like Jack was right.

844
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,650
Tell the teams to stand down for the time being.

845
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,350
Keep tracking Hassein by satellite.

846
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,390
Son of a bitch.

847
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,320
Damn it!

848
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,020
Get out of the car!

849
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,690
Put your hands in the air!

850
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,890
Step behind the vehicle now!

851
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,650
Come on! Come on!

852
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,420
Get out of the car!

853
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,490
Get your hands up, Now!

854
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,720
and step out of the vehicle!

855
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,490
Suspect is armed...

856
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,090
Step away from the car!

857
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,690
Take two steps forward!

858
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,820
On your knees!

859
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,450
Put your palms down!

860
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,520
Put your chest flat on the ground!

861
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


862
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,040
I'm the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America!

2
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,870
You will listen to me!

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,300
Put down your weapon.

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,590
If another one of my men dies, your daughter will be killed.

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,660
We need to get out of here.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,660
What?

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,660
You're in danger.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,750
From who?

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,920
Don't ask questions, just come with me.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,420
Please, help me!

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,350
Debbie, what's wrong?

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,110
What did you do to her?

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,040
O'Brian.

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,700
The satellite up yet?

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,440
No, I have to reposition without Driscoll noticing.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,630
Where are you?

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,300
I'm at a Mercury Martin in Solmas.

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,260
I had to stage a robbery to keep the hostile in place.

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,530
Tell those officers to put their guns down and stand back!

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,890
Edgar, I need you to help me.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,060
Help you with what?

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,560
I've been in contact with Jack Bauer.

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,720
What?

24
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,150
That's right. Now you're involved,

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,250
so you're either going to help me,

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,180
or you're going to turn me in.

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,420
You're asking me to do something

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
that can get me fired.

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,480
I know you were working

30
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,550
with her behind Driscoll's back.

31
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,680
What do you want?

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,980
I want to make sure

33
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,540
I have your attention whenever I need it.

34
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,970
Chloe, why are you logged on

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
to an active DOD satellite?

36
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,140
All right, you're done here.

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,500
I was going to quit anyway.

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,070
I want you to call Jack Bauer now.

39
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,900
Driscoll wants to talk to you.

40
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,830
Stand down, Jack. It's over.

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,300
Erin, right now Hasan is free.

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
He's looking for a car and a phone.

43
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,490
Once he has those things,

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,060
he's going to lead us straight to Secretary Heller,I promise.

45
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,250
Son of a bitch.

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
Get out of the car!

47
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,700
Do we still have a SAT visual on Kalil Hasan?

48
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,930
He's west of the 14 on Route 11.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
Average speed, 62 miles per hour.

50
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,300
All right, I want traffic workups,

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,600
roadwork schedules.

52
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,100
We can't let anything delay or prevent him

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
from reaching his destination.

54
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,960
We need the tactical teams to launch now.

55
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,490
Keep them at Jack's location.

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,990
I'm coordinating with Division.

57
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,490
Do you want me to pre-emp that?

58
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,720
- Yes, at one point.  - All right.

59
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,920
Curtis, I can pull up those tactical teams

60
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
for you if you want.

61
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,150
No, you can't.

62
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,410
That requires a level-three channel.

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,880
You don't have that kind of clearance.

64
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,110
Miss Driscoll?

65
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,340
I have a Sergeant Paulson

66
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,340
from the Sheriff's Department on line one.

67
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,540
He says it's important.

68
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,460
Sergeant Paulson,

69
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,200
this is Erin Driscoll at CTU.

70
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,130
How can I help you?

71
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,960
Yeah, I have a man named Jack Bauer in custody,

72
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,960
He claims he works with you. Is that true?

73
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,360
Yes, it is.

74
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,420
He just robbed a convenience store near Route 11

75
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,920
and claims it was part

76
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,880
of some undercover operation to delay a suspect

77
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,350
until satellite coverage could be established.

78
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,110
That's also true,Sergeant.

79
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,310
Well, it might be nice

80
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,110
if you communicated with us a little better.

81
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,710
Well, there were some national security issues involved,

82
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,540
and I'm so sorry for any inconvenience.

83
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
May I please speak to Mr. Bauer?

84
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,100
All right.

85
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,230
Uncuff him.

86
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,860
Thank you.

87
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,390
Tell me that you didn't arrest Hasan.

88
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,960
No, he's still in the vehicle

89
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,220
and we're still tracking him by satellite.

90
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,290
We intercepted a phone call

91
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,720
that indicated he's headed for the site

92
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,820
where Secretary Heller's being held.

93
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,980
You're going to need someone

94
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,850
coordinating things on the ground.

95
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,850
That should be me.

96
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,010
Erin, listen to me.

97
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,510
We can get Heller and Audrey out of there,

98
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,510
but we need to work together

99
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,910
and we need to start that now.

100
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,200
We have to find Heller before this trial starts.

101
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,570
It's the right move, Erin.

102
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,700
He's our only option.

103
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,700
All right, you're in,

104
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,500
but you coordinate through me.

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,160
And, Jack, make this work.

106
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,730
I will.

107
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,890
Please advise Sergeant Paulson of the new chain of command.

108
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,090
Yeah?

109
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,450
In my capacity as Director of CTU,

110
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,020
I'm vesting Jack Bauer with the authority to command

111
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
and control this part of the ground operation.

112
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,480
Consider him in charge.

113
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,580
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,710
Thank you.

115
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,910
Sounds like you're the new boss.

116
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,210
Tell me what you need.

117
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,610
The vehicle the hostile was driving was stolen.

118
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,940
I need to make sure there's no APB on it.

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,100
If there is one,

120
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,970
I need you to get CHP to cancel it.

121
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,170
I also left my CTU vehicle

122
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,470
over at the convenience mart.

123
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,530
I'll have it brought right over.

124
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Thank you.

125
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,890
Why don't you go get that car?

126
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,310
Hasan's making another phone call.

127
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,480
Bring it up, patch it through to Jack.

128
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,870
Bauer.

129
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,100
Jack, it's Edgar Stiles.

130
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,100
Hasan's making another phone call.

131
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,530
I'm patching it to you.

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,570
Okay.

133
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,560
Yes?

134
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,360
It's Kalil. I'm on my way.

135
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,690
How much longer?

136
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,220
About a half an hour.

137
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,390
The broadcast must begin on time.

138
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,720
Any problems?

139
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,380
Nothing I couldn't handle.

140
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,580
How are you coming with the servers?

141
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,280
Dumar and Farez are managing,

142
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,650
but I'm sure they could use your help.

143
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,210
I'll be there soon.

144
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
All right.

145
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,810
Did Heller sign the confession?

146
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,440
Yes.

147
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,400
He didn't want to, but we used his daughter.

148
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,230
Did you kill her?

149
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,460
Not yet.

150
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,500
Sergeant Paulson?

151
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,860
What's the E.T.A. on my vehicle?

152
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,360
Any second, Agent Bauer.

153
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,960
I'll see you soon.

154
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,920
I want to hear it again.

155
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,190
Play it back.

156
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,380
Okay, Jack, one second. Let me play it back.

157
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,580
Tell your men to stay on channel three.

158
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,310
Got it.

159
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,680
Any problems?

160
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,410
Nothing I couldn't handle.

161
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,240
How are you coming with the servers?

162
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,650
Dad?

163
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,720
You did what anyone else would have done

164
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,850
in your position.

165
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,380
I embarrassed my country.

166
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,380
You signed a piece of paper.

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,240
all lies.

168
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,210
Everyone will know that you signed it under duress.

169
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,840
It's more than a piece of paper.

170
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,700
This trial is going to be a spectacle,

171
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,800
broadcast all over the world,

172
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,930
designed to humiliate and degrade this country.

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,530
Dad...

174
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,520
there's still time.

175
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,090
There's no sense in deluding ourselves.

176
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,590
There's less than an hour.

177
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,250
If we're going to do anything,

178
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,610
we have to do it now.

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,880
We've done everything that we can.

180
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,310
Not quite.

181
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,510
What do you mean?

182
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,070
What if I'm not alive?

183
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,600
They can't put me on trial.

184
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,030
If I'm dead, their goals go right out the window.

185
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,760
And they'll be viewed as nothing more than common assassins.

186
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,790
Dad...

187
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,820
Listen to me.

188
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,290
Even if I say what they want me to say,

189
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,920
they're not going to let me go.

190
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,120
They're going to put me in front of a camera, humiliate me,

191
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,110
and then they're going to kill me

192
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,310
with the whole world watching.

193
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,540
There are people on the outside looking for us.

194
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,400
You cannot give up.

195
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,010
I have to do something while I still can.

196
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,870
And I need you to help me.

197
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,960
Help you?

198
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,460
The chain between your handcuffs,

199
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,460
see if you can get it up and around my neck.

200
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,390
No, no.

201
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,820
I can't do it myself!

202
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,820
I don't have any leverage.

203
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,820
No.

204
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,890
But you can pull from back there!

205
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,050
Dad...

206
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm counting on you to help me!

207
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,680
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

208
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,150
At least try it!

209
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,440
I won't do it.

210
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,910
I won't do it, Dad.

211
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,930
I'm sorry.

212
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,950
There's a gas pipe.

213
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,380
If we could break it...

214
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,380
No.

215
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,250
Break that, you die, too.

216
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,080
Do you think that they are going

217
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,570
to let me out of here alive?

218
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,770
Do you?

219
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,040
They're going to kill me, too.

220
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,830
Dad...

221
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,150
Together we can do this. We can do it,

222
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,180
okay?

223
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,310
Please.

224
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,110
Let's try it.

225
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,600
We're almost there.

226
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,090
Okay, that's good.

227
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,380
You ready?

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,510
Yeah.

229
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,060
I love you.

230
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,760
I love you, too, honey.

231
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,670
I want a full analysis on both these voices.

232
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,730
Okay. I'll have it done in ten minutes.

233
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,900
Thank you.

234
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,300
Edgar.

235
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,300
What, Maryanne?

236
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,700
What's a level three channel?

237
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,660
It's a logon that gets you into all the systems,

238
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,060
tactical, district and division.

239
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,190
I want it.

240
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,090
What do you mean?

241
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,530
I want clearance for a level three channel.

242
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,360
I can't give it to you. Only Driscoll

243
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,660
can authorize that.

244
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,190
I don't care who authorizes it. I want it.

245
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,590
Look, just because you overheard that conversation

246
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,220
between Chloe and me, it doesn't mean I'm your bitch.

247
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm done being scared of you.

248
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,190
Miss Driscoll, it's Maryanne.

249
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,990
Yes, Maryanne, what is it?

250
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,850
I've some further information for you

251
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,520
regarding Chloe's circumventing your authority.

252
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,820
I'm listening.

253
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,120
I don't think she was acting alone.

254
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,080
Who was she working with?

255
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,780
I'm not sure, but I found an electronic echo in her call log,

256
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,350
and every time she spoke to Jack,

257
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,180
there was someone else on the line, too.

258
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,550
That's an automated behavior on our system.

259
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,820
Doesn't mean anyone else was on the line.

260
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,010
Is that the extent

261
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,720
of your suspicion?

262
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Yes, I'm, uh, I'm sorry to have bothered you.

263
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,880
You're sick.

264
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,450
You're going to go to Driscoll and you're

265
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,380
going to tell her you're overloaded and you need help,

266
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,710
and you're going to ask her

267
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,640
to issue me a level-three channel clearance.

268
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,110
Unit Three, this is Bauer, do you copy?

269
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,370
Copy.

270
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,670
Back off another 200 yards.

271
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,370
We can't afford to be spotted here.

272
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,370
Roger that.

273
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,370
Jack you there?

274
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,370
Yeah?

275
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,640
The marines have assembled

276
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,970
and are leaving base.

277
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,840
Okay, have Chloe collate the satellite images.

278
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,140
Make sure they stay in sync.

279
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
Chloe's in a holding room, Jack.

280
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,940
She's been suspended.

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,500
We could use her help here.

282
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,900
Things are under control.

283
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,500
I'll have Curtis collate the images.

284
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,640
Erin, Chloe was just doing what I asked her to.

285
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,830
The point is, she was supposed to be working for me.

286
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
I understand that, but...

287
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,830
Jack, it's one thing for you

288
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,730
to disobey me in the field,

289
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,570
but for someone who works for me here at CTU to betray me?

290
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,730
I can't reactivate her.

291
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,070
It's a non-starter.

292
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,300
Anything else?

293
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,670
No, nothing else.

294
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,090
We have a situation here.

295
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,290
I realize that.

296
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,990
I can do the math as well as anyone.

297
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,590
The math?

298
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,990
Protocols were violated.

299
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,860
Someone has to take the bullet.

300
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,430
Jack's indispensable right now and I'm not.

301
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,460
It took a lot of guts

302
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,790
for you to do what you did.

303
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,590
I trusted Jack.

304
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,330
A lot of people around here trust Jack.

305
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,190
Doesn't mean they're going to risk their careers for him.

306
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,220
I have a suggestion.

307
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,190
I'm going to leave this room, call Admin.

308
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,620
They'll fax over some resignation papers,

309
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,890
and you sign them.

310
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,490
And then what?

311
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,020
And then nothing.

312
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,820
I walk out?

313
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,350
You walk out.

314
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,820
No jail, no sanctions?

315
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,650
That's right.

316
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,280
Although, if you need a letter of recommendation

317
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,650
for your next job,

318
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,880
you probably should get it from Jack, not me.

319
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,510
Right.

320
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,710
Sound like a plan?

321
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,750
Yes.

322
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,280
For God's sake, pull yourself together.

323
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,480
She didn't know anything.

324
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,840
You didn't have to kill her.

325
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,640
Yes, I did,

326
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,010
because you didn't have the courage to kill her yourself.

327
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,510
Courage?

328
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,910
To poison a girl who did no harm to you at all?

329
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,410
Your father's home.

330
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,000
What are you doing?

331
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,300
She's already dead.

332
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,870
If your father doesn't see a bullet wound,

333
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,070
he'll ask questions.

334
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Do you want him to know that you tried

335
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,500
to help your girlfriend escape?

336
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,040
Do you want him to know that you failed him again?

337
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Move away.

338
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,270
Take it.

339
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,600
Behrooz,

340
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,070
take it.

341
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,730
Take it.

342
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,000
This has to stop, Behrooz.

343
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,530
You are my son and I love you,

344
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,530
but I cannot let you destroy everything,

345
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,830
everything we worked

346
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,130
so hard to achieve.

347
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,260
I know this was difficult for you,

348
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,620
but it was necessary.

349
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,690
He'll dispose of the body tonight after dark.

350
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,660
Meanwhile, move her car.

351
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,020
Park it somewhere where it won't be seen.

352
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,950
Then come straight back here.

353
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,190
Navi?

354
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,010
What?

355
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,180
You got your level-three channel clearance?

356
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,140
Yes, I did.

357
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,000
So we're done, right?

358
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,140
I mean, I don't think I should have

359
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,370
to keep doing things for you.

360
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,410
What's this about anyway?

361
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,770
Why do you need a level-three clearance?

362
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,710
Look, you may be happy tapping away at a keyboard

363
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,370
for the rest of your life, but I'm not.

364
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,140
I have an opportunity here to get ahead,

365
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,170
and I intend to use it.

366
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,030
That's mine.

367
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,030
I'll be right back.

368
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,870
I'm more insulted that you thought I wouldn't notice,

369
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,400
than by the fact that you were spying on me.

370
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,630
Driscoll ordered me to do it.

371
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,660
Next time, do it right.

372
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,200
Use a Newman filter, so the subject

373
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,560
doesn't see red lights flashing everywhere.

374
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,860
Amateur.

375
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,200
Bye, Edgar.

376
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,960
Could you cover for me for just a second?

377
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,530
Chloe.

378
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,590
Can you guys give me a moment please?

379
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,860
I'm really sorry this happened.

380
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,160
Don't worry, Edgar.

381
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,390
I didn't use names.

382
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,190
Driscoll doesn't know you were helping me.

383
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,360
She doesn't?

384
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,990
I'm the one who got you into this.

385
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,520
I'm not going to sell you out.

386
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,950
Thank you.

387
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,920
You're a geek, Edgar,

388
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,050
but you're a good guy.

389
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Stay that way.

390
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,420
I don't really have a choice.

391
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,420
I guess not.

392
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,420
Good luck today.

393
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,450
You're gonna need it.

394
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,770
Sarah, assuming he continues driving west,

395
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,470
what are our potential target areas?

396
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,370
Well, within the time frame he mentioned,

397
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,570
Hasan will reach one of four

398
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,710
residential communities and two industrial areas.

399
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,580
Data-mine those areas.

400
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
See if you can find any suspicious activity

401
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,440
in the last six months.

402
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,510
Citizen complaints, known associates, everything.

403
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,810
On it.

404
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,180
Jack, the hostile's stopping at an intersection.

405
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,620
Okay, I got him.

406
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,320
Yo, Mohammed.

407
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,120
That's your name, right?

408
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,720
Ain't that what they call all you people?

409
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,190
I'm just trying to get home.

410
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,790
It'd be nice if all of ya'll went home.

411
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Erin, three men have approached Hasan's vehicle.

412
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,800
- Edgar, can you enhance this?  - Hang on.

413
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,400
Look, I don't want any trouble.

414
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,670
Too late, Mohammed!

415
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,500
That's him.

416
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,040
Let's go, man. Let's go.

417
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,140
You three, stay right there.

418
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,050
Damn it, the police have got to stay clear of this.

419
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,420
I ordered a cancellation of the APB on the truck.

420
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,890
Make sure that that happened.

421
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,990
It did.

422
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,020
It may not have gotten out yet

423
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,620
to all the local CHP branches.

424
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,060
If they detain Hasan, this thing is over.

425
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,320
He'll never lead us back to Heller.

426
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,960
Put me through to CHP.

427
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,260
Sarah.

428
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,790
This is CTU.

429
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,630
I have a priority call for local dispatch.

430
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,040
You want to move this vehicle, please?

431
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,710
Step out of the truck, please, sir?

432
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,080
What's going on here?

433
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,380
Just working some things out

434
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,780
between him and I, that's all.

435
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,990
Is that right?

436
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,390
Yes, sir.

437
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,720
You three, stand by your car and wait.

438
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,190
Come on.

439
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,560
We're going to lose him!

440
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,260
Get me CHP now!

441
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,500
Want to tell me what's going on?

442
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,170
There's really no problem, officer.

443
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,330
They're just upset

444
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,800
about what happened this morning.

445
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,740
I'm sorry about that, sir.

446
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,140
Can I go now?

447
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,610
Just bear with me one minute.

448
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,340
Why don't you go ahead and call this in?

449
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,410
Copy that.

450
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,050
Jack, I have local CHP dispatch.

451
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,390
Patch them through.

452
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,360
CHP. This is Officer Dudley.

453
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,820
Officer, I canceled an APB on a yellow pickup truck,

454
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,390
license plate number 4-Los Angeles-Independent-945,

455
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,630
Did you get that?

456
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,130
Yeah, I see it on the system.

457
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,730
I haven't gotten word of the cancellation here, though.

458
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,560
One of your officers is questioning the driver

459
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,530
of that vehicle.

460
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
It is imperative

461
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,730
that that driver not be detained any longer.

462
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,510
We'll get you on your way as soon as possible.

463
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,510
Don't let those guys get to you.

464
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,680
They're just talks.

465
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,810
I think everybody's been a bit jumpy today

466
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
with everything going on.

467
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,790
I appreciate your patience and cooperation.

468
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,090
6214, copy.

469
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,460
Roger that.

470
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,260
We're all clear.

471
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,500
Have a nice day, sir.

472
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,970
Thank you, sir.

473
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,910
We're in the clear.

474
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,310
He's moving.

475
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,390
He's making another call.

476
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,650
Pipe it through to Jack.

477
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,120
Kalil's making another call, Jack.

478
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,530
Finish the setup and let's do a test.

479
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes?

480
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,300
We may have a problem.

481
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,830
I'm listening.

482
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,840
The police just ran the plates of the vehicle I'm driving.

483
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,140
And?

484
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,570
They let me go.

485
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,100
Jack, are you getting this?

486
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,140
Yeah.

487
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,110
So what is the problem?

488
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,470
This is a stolen car.

489
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,940
Maybe the owner hasn't reported it yet?

490
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,510
Or maybe I'm getting help

491
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,580
from people who want to make sure

492
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,050
I get where I'm going.

493
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,480
Do not jump to conclusions.

494
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,850
A police officer was approaching me, his hand on his gun.

495
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,520
Then he got a call, suddenly there's no problem.

496
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,930
We can't take any chances.

497
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,060
I'm moving in.

498
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,060
He's not going to lead us to the site.

499
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,160
The best we can do right now

500
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,560
is try to take him alive and break him.

501
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,430
All units, move in.

502
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,800
I repeat, move in.

503
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,040
Okay, I've got a visual.

504
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,170
Set up a roadblock at mile marker 15.

505
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,940
It has been an honor working with you, Omar.

506
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,850
The honor has been mine, Kalil.

507
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,380
Come on.

508
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,690
Allah Akbar.

509
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,280
No!

510
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,650
Oh, God.

511
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
He just drove head-on into another vehicle.

512
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,950
He was our only lead.

513
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,690
We're going to switch gears since we've lost our only lead.

514
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,330
Kalil Hasan committed suicide en route to Heller's location.

515
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,430
Have they recovered anything on him

516
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,100
that might help identify where Heller is?

517
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,530
It's too soon to tell.

518
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,370
They're still putting out the fire from the crash.

519
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,470
How much time do we have

520
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,300
before this trial begins to broadcast?

521
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,740
Some time in the next, ten, 15 minutes.

522
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,440
Sarah Gavin.

523
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,610
It's Jack.

524
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,410
Put him on speaker.

525
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,340
Go ahead, Jack, you're on speaker.

526
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,740
I'm sifting through the wreckage now,

527
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,180
but there's not much intact.

528
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,480
Hasan said he was 30 minutes from his destination.

529
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,820
It's 20 minutes before he stopped.

530
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,920
Do we have a maximum perimeter?

531
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,620
Edgar?

532
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,690
We're looking at a radius of 60 miles centered at Acton.

533
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,260
We're dispatching choppers and fixed-wing crafts

534
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,290
to survey the area.

535
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,690
No, that's going to take too long.

536
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,530
Use the satellites. Conduct a thermal scan.

537
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,860
- It won't work.  - Why not?

538
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,200
That area has a high concentration

539
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,490
of electric power transmitters.

540
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,200
The satellite won't be able to distinguish

541
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,600
between them and the servers.

542
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,200
Those transmitters have been in place for years.

543
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,600
If we take a scan,

544
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,970
we can lay it against the previous grid pattern.

545
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,970
That way we can identify any new thermal activity.

546
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,810
We can start the scan immediately.

547
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,880
Do it.

548
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,110
Jack?

549
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,310
We're using a satellite to check the thermals.

550
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,650
Keep the line open.

551
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,750
Hurry.

552
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,980
Miss Driscoll? The clinic wanted me

553
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,550
to tell you that your daughter has arrived.

554
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,020
Thank you.

555
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,950
All right, everyone reset your systems.

556
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,860
Let's get back on track.

557
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,490
I have to take care of something

558
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
for a few minutes.

559
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,190
Would you check in with Division?

560
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,660
They're expecting an update.

561
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,960
Everything okay?

562
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,760
Yeah, just a little problem with my daughter, Maya.

563
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,200
I had to bring her down to the clinic.

564
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,230
Is she okay?

565
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,700
She's fine. Call Division.

566
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,450
What are you working on?

567
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,510
Personnel allocation tables and tactical generals

568
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,880
for the assault teams.

569
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,380
I notice every time I look over, you're talking to Edgar.

570
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,690
What's that all about?

571
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,220
I'm just trying to learn the ropes, Curtis.

572
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,030
Today is not the day

573
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,460
to make career moves on people, Maryanne.

574
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,060
The only thing you should be thinking about

575
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,800
is how to help us stop Heller from being publicly executed.

576
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,500
Come on, Curtis. Give me some credit.

577
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,670
Save it.

578
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,240
I know how you think.

579
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,270
Just leave everybody alone and help us get through today.

580
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,580
- Mark?  - Hmm?

581
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,180
Thank you so much for helping me out.

582
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,320
They said Maya's arrived?

583
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,750
She's in the exam area.

584
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,190
We're about to do a workup.

585
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,590
She's been on Thorazine.

586
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,590
She stopped taking it.

587
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,790
How long ago?

588
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,090
Based on what happened this morning,

589
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,530
at least a few days.

590
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,760
What happened?

591
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,630
She's fixated on one of my neighbor's kids.

592
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
What does she do?

593
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,770
She walks into the yard,

594
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,570
gets verbally abusive.

595
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,040
I'll take good care of her.

596
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Thank you.

597
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,340
Sure.

598
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,680
Maya?

599
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,910
Mom, I'm so happy to see you.

600
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,880
I was going crazy at home.

601
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,120
What happened with Evan?

602
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,480
Why did you go over there?

603
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,820
I know you said not to,

604
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,220
but he was throwing things against the fence.

605
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,820
Maya,

606
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,130
he plays with a ball.

607
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,390
He's seven years old, sweetheart.

608
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,460
I don't care how old he is.

609
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,230
He should know better.

610
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,730
Are you going to talk to his dad about this?

611
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,400
Come here.

612
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Look at me.

613
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,480
Mm-hmm.

614
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,510
You're not thinking clearly, honey.

615
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,810
You've got to put it out of your mind.

616
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,820
Dr. Calis is going to help and you're going

617
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,450
to feel better very soon.

618
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,950
Why don't we go home right now?

619
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,220
We can't, honey.

620
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,390
Why not?

621
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,790
There's a little trouble here in L.A.

622
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,260
and I have to take care of it.

623
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,560
Are you going to be okay?

624
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,130
Yes, I'm going to be okay.

625
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,270
And you're going to be okay.

626
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,040
I love you so much.

627
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,410
I love you, too, honey.

628
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,780
Shh...

629
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,250
Shh.

630
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,280
It's okay. It's okay.

631
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,150
Yes?

632
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,590
Kalil is dead.

633
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,120
Dead? How?

634
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,260
He was being followed here.

635
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,420
He martyred himself

636
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,460
without hesitation.

637
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,630
What about the servers?

638
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,660
Have they been re-conformed

639
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,730
for the broadcast?

640
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,030
Dumar is doing his best.

641
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
I think we'll be all right.

642
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,770
If you need help, I can come.

643
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,040
No, no, no. It is too risky.

644
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,470
If the servers don't work correctly,

645
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,480
we're in trouble.

646
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,040
This trial is only the beginning.

647
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,210
I know that as well as you, my friend.

648
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,310
But there's no need to worry.

649
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,050
Everything will go as planned.

650
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,720
You checked out the briefcase?

651
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,850
It's fine.

652
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,820
I was afraid it might be damaged

653
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,020
in the train crash.

654
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,230
The case is very strong. There's no problem.

655
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,230
Good.

656
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,430
Then you can get started.

657
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,140
Gas.

658
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,910
I smell gas.

659
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,570
Heller.

660
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,750
Come on! Get them out!

661
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,990
Come on, get them out! Come on, hurry!

662
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,590
Come on.

663
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,370
Hurry, open the door!

664
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,470
Come on!

665
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,070
Do whatever it takes to revive him!

666
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,500
I know him.

667
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,500
She recognized me.

668
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,040
She has to be killed.

669
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,070
She will,

670
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,970
in good time.

671
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,070
Go do your job.

672
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,280
Go.

673
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Yeah?

674
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,380
We got the results

675
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,420
from the thermal scan.

676
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,290
One site matches the criteria.

677
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,620
Where?

678
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,360
An old industrial park around three miles from you.

679
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,960
Give me the exact address.

680
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,860
It's off a service road south of Brach.

681
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,160
Okay, I'll set up the staging area.

682
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,200
- Where is the marine strike force?  - 20 minutes away.

683
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,030
This trial starts any minute, Jack.

684
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,300
I know. I'll get back to you soon as I'm on site.

685
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,970
Meanwhile, have someone download the schematics to the building.

686
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,170
Send them over to my screen.

687
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Edgar's on it.

688
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,150
We'll take the rest of these up later.

689
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,250
Yes, Mr. President.

690
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,120
What is it, Robert?

691
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,290
CTU thinks it's identified the location where the terrorists

692
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,860
are holding Secretary Heller and his daughter.

693
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,100
Where?

694
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,730
A compound in the Santa Clarita Valley.

695
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,900
But there is a problem.

696
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,560
The team's dispatched to the site

697
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,930
may not get there in time

698
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,840
to prevent the broadcast, and even if they do,

699
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,170
there is a good chance the Secretary will be killed

700
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,300
in any rescue attempt.

701
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,440
Well, we have no choice

702
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,010
but to hope and pray that you're wrong.

703
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,240
We do have a choice.

704
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,850
The Secretary's death would be tragic.

705
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,180
But his execution on American soil,

706
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,320
broadcast to the world, would be far worse.

707
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,360
It would be a complete and utter humiliation for the country.

708
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,990
Perhaps the worst in our history.

709
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,520
I'm well aware of that, Robert.

710
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,190
But unless you have some solution,

711
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,360
I'm missing the point of this conversation.

712
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,960
The solution is, we make a preemptive strike.

713
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,560
Assuming we locate the site

714
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,800
in time, we destroy it.

715
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,970
We kill our own Secretary of Defense?

716
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,300
To prevent our enemies

717
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,840
from making a public spectacle of his death.

718
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,770
He's going to be killed anyway.

719
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,380
Jim Heller is a good friend.

720
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,820
A loyal public servant.

721
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,320
You expect me to kill him to save face?

722
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,230
Not yours, sir.

723
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,360
The country's.

724
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,800
If we look impotent in this situation,

725
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,000
we'll only encourage more attacks.

726
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,700
And if I may say so, sir,

727
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,200
having known Jim Heller many years myself,

728
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,710
if he were here, he'd be the first to endorse this plan.

729
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,670
The public will never accept it.

730
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,880
All the public will know is the Secretary died

731
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,740
during the course of a rescue attempt,

732
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:06,980
which is certainly more palatable

733
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,080
than letting him be executed

734
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,830
with the whole world watching.

735
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,890
It's a woman.

736
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,720
I don't know her.

737
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,880
- Oh, God.  - Who is she?

738
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,740
It's Debbie's mom.

739
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,910
Go back.

740
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,240
Stay there until she leaves.

741
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,740
- What are you going to do?  - Go.

742
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,000
It's the girl's mother.

743
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,270
What?

744
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,500
Mrs. Araz?

745
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,600
Yes?

746
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,130
I'm Karen Pendleton, Debbie's mother.

747
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,060
Oh, good to meet you.

748
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,330
Call me Dina.

749
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,530
It's good to meet you.

750
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,590
My husband and I are

751
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,420
very fond of Behrooz.

752
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,820
He's one of the few boys

753
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,520
who seem to know the meaning of please and thank you.

754
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,790
Oh, I'm looking for Debbie.

755
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,210
This is my husband Navi.

756
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,410
This is Debbie's mother.

757
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,420
Oh, she's

758
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,710
a very lovely girl.

759
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,710
Oh, thank you.

760
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,240
We just got a call from

761
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,780
our dermatologist's office.

762
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,270
She missed her appointment this morning. Is she here?

763
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,040
We haven't seen her since yesterday.

764
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh, she left a message saying she was on her way

765
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,000
- to see Behrooz.  - There must be a misunderstanding.

766
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,300
Perhaps she stopped off...

767
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,930
No, she wouldn't have stopped off anywhere,

768
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,430
she knew she had this appointment.

769
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,730
It'll take weeks to reschedule and...

770
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,660
Is Behrooz here?

771
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,930
He is studying.

772
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,760
Well, maybe he knows where she is?

773
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
I doubt it.

774
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,120
He hasn't left his room all morning.

775
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,290
School is very important to him.

776
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,580
Oh, that's her phone.

777
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,910
I know the ring.

778
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,880
Many, many phones sound alike, Mrs. Pendleton.

779
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,080
No, she downloaded that ring specially.

780
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,970
It's one of her favorite songs.

781
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,700
That's definitely her phone.

782
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,970
Mrs. Pendleton.

783
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,540
It was my phone.

784
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,060
Debbie and I downloaded the same ring

785
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,900
when we started going out.

786
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,560
Oh.

787
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,260
Do you know where she is?

788
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,190
She said she had a doctor's appointment

789
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,360
to go to this morning,

790
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,360
and we're going to the movies later.

791
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,420
I'm sorry about this.

792
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,180
I'm just worried.

793
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,320
Well, if you do see her, or if she calls,

794
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,650
will you have her call me?

795
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,240
Oh, yes, of course.

796
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,210
I told you

797
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,380
not to interfere.

798
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,670
It was her phone.

799
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,770
I shut it off.

800
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,200
He took care of it, Navi.

801
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,640
She went away because she believed him.

802
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,730
Let's hope so.

803
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,300
Get in the car.

804
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,430
Follow her.

805
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,530
Make sure she doesn't go to the police.

806
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,730
All right.

807
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,680
I'm less than two minutes out.

808
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,140
Have you worked up the rescue approach?

809
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,340
We're running up scenarios now based on the schematics.

810
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,870
Okay, what are the probabilities of finding the Secretary

811
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,340
and his daughter in the compound?

812
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,800
Our analysts have looked at everything.

813
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,200
The data is fuzzy, but our best guess

814
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,970
is that they're on the west end of the building.

815
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,670
- Together or separate?  - We don't know that yet.

816
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,630
Okay, we're going to have to activate a team split,

817
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,260
one for the Secretary, one for his daughter.

818
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,890
We discussed that, Jack, but it was rejected.

819
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,190
What are you talking about?

820
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,020
It comes directly from the President.

821
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,360
Once we go in strong,

822
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,020
there'll be very little time to secure the hostages.

823
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,390
Our only priority is to get Heller.

824
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,590
Curtis that doesn't make sense.

825
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,250
I don't like it any more than you do,Jack,

826
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,980
but those are the orders.

827
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,580
Jack?

828
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,410
They're about to begin the broadcast.

829
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,810
I'm almost there.

830
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,270
Damn it.

831
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,920
We are about to embark on a process of justice,

832
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,250
that will forever change the world.

833
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,450
Our people will finally be liberated

834
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,050
from the tangle of corruption

835
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,880
that has been choking them for centuries.

836
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,710
No longer will justice be

837
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,010
the propagandist tool of the power elite.

838
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,310
It will once again become the instrument

839
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,670
of the people.

840
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,670
Delivered through true believers,

841
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,630
whose courage to use the sword has made this day

842
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,460
not only possible, but inevitable.

843
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,930
Mr. President, I've taken the liberty

844
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,530
of having a laser-guided missile programmed and prepped.

845
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,820
All that remains is for you to give the order.

846
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,920
... with the same conviction and resolve...

847
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,420
How long between my order and impact?

848
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,890
The fighter's in the air.

849
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,150
It needs to get in range, no more than ten minutes.

850
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,020
... required to render judgment fairly,

851
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,520
without prejudice,

852
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,280
or we will be judged the same as our enemies.

853
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,480
As our prisoner shall be judged today...

854
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,740
Do it.

855
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,140
Let Driscoll know.

856
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,870
... this nation will also be judged.

857
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,810
Today is the day the United States of America

858
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,340
shall be tested for the final time

859
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,400
on your own soil, before the eyes of the world.

860
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,130
Yes, I understand.

861
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,020
Jack, I have Miss Driscoll for you.

862
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,280
Jack, what's your position?

863
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,520
I'm on site.

864
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,710
Jack, stand down.

865
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,950
What are you talking about?

866
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,580
The marines won't get there on time.

867
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,610
The President wants to take out the building

868
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,770
with a missile strike.

869
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,640
With the Secretary and his daughter inside?

870
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,770
Yes.

871
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,610
Let me speak to the President.

872
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,500
Jack, I've been trying to get through to him myself.

873
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,600
I'm sorry. You're going to have to clear the area.

874
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,260
Jack, don't go in there by yourself.

875
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,400
Jack, talk to me.

876
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,260
The air strike's already been ordered.

877
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,190
Jack, clear the area.

878
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


879
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,000
For God's sake, pull yourself together.

2
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,260
You didn't have to kill her.

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,800
Yes, I did, because you didn't have the courage to kill her yourself.

4
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,220
Courage? To poison a girl who did no harm to you at all?

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,980
This is my husband Navi. This is Debbie's mother.

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,770
Is she here?

7
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,100
We haven't seen her since yesterday.

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,360
Get in the car, follow her. Make sure she doesn't go to the police.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
You're out of here.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,700
Chloe.

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,870
Don't worry, Edgar. Driscoll doesn't know you were helping me.

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,410
She doesn't?

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm the one who got you into this, I'm not going to sell you out.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,290
We'll be here until you tell me what I need to know.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,750
Richard, your father was kidnapped by terrorists.

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,010
Our polygraph analysis tells us

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,010
you're hiding something that might help us find him.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,390
There are people on the outside looking for us.

19
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,680
You cannot give up.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,720
I have to do something while I still can.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,180
This trial is going to be a spectacle,

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,270
broadcast all over the world,

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,400
designed to humiliate and degrade this country.

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,110
There's a gas pipe.

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,780
Did you check out the package?

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,280
Mm. It's fine.

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,950
I was afraid it might be damaged in the train crash.

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,660
The case is very strong.

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,540
Come on! Get them out! Come on!

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,750
Hurry, open the door!

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,380
I know you.

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,920
She recognized me. She has to be killed.

33
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,720
Erin, I'm on sight.

34
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,130
Jack, stand down.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,340
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,050
The Marines won't get there on time.

37
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,220
The President wants to take out the building with a missile strike.

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,180
With the secretary and his daughter inside?

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,520
Yes. I'm sorry.

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,140
You're going to have to clear the area.

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,810
Jack, don't go in there by yourself.

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,150
Jack, clear the area. The building is going to be destroyed.

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,540
James Heller, you have been brought before this court of law

44
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,330
to stand trial as a war criminal.

45
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,380
We will prove to the people of the world

46
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,880
that these crimes against humanity

47
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,680
are the direct result of the polices initiated by you in your capacity.

48
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,850
Since the true extent of your evil legacy is immeasurable,

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,690
we have done our best to document

50
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,320
those acts which have been witnessed directly by the chosen followers.

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,570
Under your orders, the death squads of America,

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,370
continue their imperious crusade against the true believers and pure followers.

53
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,960
How much longer until the fighter is ready to launch the missile?

54
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,080
Command and control is locking on target now.

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,000
Mr. President, I have Erin Driscoll on line three.

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,220
Mr. President, I'm calling to ask you to consider aborting the missile strike.

57
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,430
Based on what?

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
We are attempting a rescue operation.

59
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,900
I was told that the Marine Strike Force was still 10 to 20 minutes away.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,030
They are, sir. Jack Bauer went in by himself.

61
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,080
The terrorist group

62
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,500
is moments away from executing the Secretary of Defense in front of the world.

63
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,120
And I cannot allow that to happen.

64
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,420
I understand, sir.

65
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,290
But if Jack can effect a rescue before that happens...

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,590
In that case, I'll abort the missile strike.

67
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,170
But he's running out of time.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,680
How long does he have, sir?

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,470
Seven minutes.

70
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,640
Try and make a sound, I'll blow your head off.

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,520
This is a map of the complex.

72
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,030
Where are they holding the Secretary of Defense?

73
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,910
I am either going to kill you now,

74
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,530
or you're going to tell me where they are staging the trial!

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,120
Point... now. Where is the secretary?

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,220
There is no place in this world

77
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,640
where your evil has not scoured the sacred land of the true word.

78
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,270
Your imperialistic legacy has devoured the lives of the innocent.

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,070
Jack?

80
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,900
Yeah?

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,110
The President won't call off the missile strike.

82
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,860
- How much time do I have?  - Less than six minutes.

83
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,910
Did you get a read from the thermal scan on how many hostiles inside?

84
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,240
We estimate 16.

85
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,910
Jack?

86
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,580
I'm not turning back, Erin.

87
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,960
Understood.

88
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:11,880
Good luck.

89
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,570
Stop this, please.

90
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,240
Just stop this, please. You've got to stop this.

91
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,700
My father hasn't done anything to hurt you.

92
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,990
He's an innocent man. Please!

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,620
Please. He's an innocent man.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,340
Please.

95
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,090
Listen to me.

96
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,550
Please, no, no, no, wait, wait, no. You've got to stop it! Listen.

97
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Audrey?

98
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,930
Behind you.

99
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,020
Oh, my God.

100
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,690
Jack!

101
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,020
Are you all right? Did they hurt you?

102
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,980
No, I'm okay.

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,320
- You've  got to stop them.  - I will.

104
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,860
Get my father first.

105
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Go.

106
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,540
Take this.

107
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,090
Press the button on the handle.

108
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,680
You use that if you have to.

109
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,930
I'll be back for you, I promise.

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,440
Jack.

111
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,620
Finally, we hold you responsible for blasphemy.

112
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,910
For desecrating holy lands and shrines,

113
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,170
and for spilling the blood of our brothers.

114
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,510
James Heller, your guilt on these charges is not a matter of dispute.

115
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,720
I have, here, a full confession that you have signed.

116
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,730
And so, now, it is time for your sentence to be read

117
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,440
and the execution of that sentence to be carried out.

118
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,740
James Heller, before the eyes of God, I sentence you to death...

119
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,410
to be carried out...

120
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,280
immediately.

121
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,290
Call off the missile. Call it off!

122
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,750
Abort. Abort. Please confirm.

123
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,500
He's doing it.

124
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
There's one in the pipe, safety's off. We've got to get Audrey.

125
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,200
Down the hall.

126
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,160
It's been aborted. The strike's been called off.

127
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,000
Where are the Marines?

128
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,250
They haven't crossed the perimeter. I'll get an updated E.T.A.

129
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,690
We're clear.

130
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,620
She was here. We got to go. Move! Move!

131
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,730
There's two shooters at your 11:00.

132
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,600
You get ready? Go!

133
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,190
Give me a clip.

134
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,910
Jack!

135
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,830
It went off my vest.

136
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,710
It's all right. Keep firing.

137
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,310
I'm out.

138
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,940
I'm out, too.

139
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,630
It's the Marines. Stay down!

140
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,140
Mr. Secretary, stay down.

141
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,010
Just stay down until this area is secure.

142
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,690
Jack! Jack! Jack!

143
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,890
Put the gun down!

144
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,850
Step back or I'll kill her!

145
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,110
Put the gun down! Put the gun down! Drop it!

146
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,820
Step back! I'll kill her! I will kill her!

147
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,070
Do it!

148
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,780
Do it!

149
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,990
Okay. Okay, just relax.

150
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
Now just stay calm.

151
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,170
Just relax.

152
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,160
This is over.

153
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,920
We're surrounded.

154
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,460
You're right.

155
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,420
First, you'll watch her die.

156
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
Yes.

157
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,970
The President sends along his gratitude.

158
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,140
I'm just glad you both are all right.

159
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,190
It's been a while since you've been in the field, Jack.

160
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,060
Looks like you haven't skipped a beat.

161
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,730
Audrey and I owe you our lives.

162
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,320
Thank you, sir.

163
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,860
I've arranged transportation for us back to CTU.

164
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,740
I'd like you and Audrey to be debriefed there.

165
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,910
Just as long as we don't lose any time

166
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,950
in finding out who these terrorists are and where they're coming from.

167
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,870
As soon as we get back there,

168
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,830
I'll set up a live feed with the office in Washington.

169
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,620
You won't miss a step.

170
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,880
Those soldiers there will take you to the chopper as soon as you're ready, sir.

171
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Good.

172
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,010
How's she doing?

173
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,880
The doctor needs to check out some of these contusions

174
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,260
and she's dehydrated.

175
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,890
Thank you.

176
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,350
- You should go.  - Where?

177
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,180
I'm taking you and your father back to CTU

178
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,350
Jack, when I was inside, I recognized one of the men.

179
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,810
Who?

180
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,110
I don't know.

181
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,400
I can't place him, but I know that I saw him before today.

182
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,700
They're going to correlate a photo file of all the casualties.

183
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,320
As soon as they've got that, you can make your I.D.

184
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,370
Excuse me. Bauer.

185
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,500
Agent Bauer, this is CTU. I've got Paul Raine on the line.

186
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,660
He'd like to speak to his wife. Is she with you?

187
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,630
Hold on one second.

188
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,880
It's Paul. He wants to speak with you.

189
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,060
- Paul.  - Audrey. Are you okay?

190
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,140
Yeah, I'm fine.

191
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,480
Thank God.

192
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,850
Where are you?

193
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,520
As soon as I heard about you and your father, I got on a plane.

194
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,570
-You're in L.A.?  - Yeah. I'm at CTU.

195
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,820
- Audrey?  - Yeah.

196
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,620
See you soon.

197
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,790
I'll see you soon.

198
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,080
You need to go.

199
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,840
You all right?

200
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,250
Mm-hmm.

201
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,860
Make sure Edgar gets this.

202
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,150
Find anything?

203
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
I'm still trying to connect up with the feed from the rescue site.

204
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,570
Division is using up most of our bandwidth.

205
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,320
Call over there and tell them to multiplex.

206
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,910
We need to start going through the debris.

207
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,410
Yeah, now that Heller is safe,

208
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,910
we're no longer in first position.

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,500
Miss Driscoll.

210
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,580
I took care of it.

211
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,250
What's that?

212
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,290
Our list of passcodes for the FBI fiber.

213
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,840
You can use their feed.

214
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,050
How did you get that?

215
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,880
I used to consult there. I still have friends.

216
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,550
As soon as I saw the load on the routing table,

217
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
I knew we'd run into a traffic jam.

218
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,060
Good. Install it.

219
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,100
Start cataloging whatever's there.

220
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,900
Anything that flags, promote it up to me.

221
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,910
You know... if you let me, Curtis, I can help you a whole lot more.

222
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,490
Honestly, I don't even know why you have a problem with me.

223
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,870
Because I'm ambitious? Okay, I'm ambitious. Aren't you?

224
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,880
I don't sleep with people to get ahead in my career.

225
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,670
Neither do I.

226
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,300
I slept with you because I was attracted to you.

227
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,970
I still am.

228
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,970
Deal with it.

229
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,770
A White House spokesman has just confirmed

230
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,570
that the interrupted video transmission was caused by a raid

231
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,110
mounted by the Marines and the counter-terrorist unit,

232
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,910
who rescued Secretary of Defense James Heller moments ago.

233
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,540
Yes, I'm watching. Of course I'm watching.

234
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,410
God willing, our good fortune will continue for the rest of the day. Thank you.

235
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,870
What are you talking about?

236
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,290
It's over. They found Omar.

237
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,210
The government stopped the trial.

238
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,130
Yes, I know.

239
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,420
Then how can you say this is all good fortune?

240
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,970
Everything we've worked for is ruined.

241
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,510
You made me kill someone I cared about, all for nothing.

242
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,140
No, not for nothing, Behrooz.

243
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,010
The trial was only our first step.

244
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
I don't understand.

245
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,900
There were certain things that your mother and I decided to keep from you.

246
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,570
- What things?  - Please, I'm busy.

247
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,900
You forced me to kill my girlfriend because of this trial.

248
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,820
- You owe me an explanation.  - I don't owe you anything!

249
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,080
See who it is.

250
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
See who it is!

251
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,800
It's Terrick.

252
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,510
Why is he here?

253
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,890
Terrick.

254
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,480
Behrooz, you remember Terrick.

255
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,400
Of course he does.

256
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,860
I just spoke with Madwan.

257
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,490
He assured me that everything is still on schedule.

258
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,040
- That's right.  - What are you doing here?

259
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,910
Your mother told Madwan you took care of the American girl?

260
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,750
Yeah.

261
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,080
Then you'll need help getting rid of the body.

262
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,880
I don't need any help. I can do it myself.

263
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm sure you can, Behrooz,

264
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,010
but we can't afford any more mistakes.

265
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,340
Show Terrick where the body is.

266
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,260
Go.

267
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,870
Okay, Curtis, this is the last of the bodies.

268
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,660
You should see them now.

269
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,870
All right. Got it. What's next?

270
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,540
Okay, here's some more of the terrorist gear out of the warehouse.

271
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,880
Wait a second. Stop. Go back.

272
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,140
You need me to retransmit ?

273
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,720
No. On the ground in front of you.

274
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,890
Can you give me a shot of that briefcase?

275
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,520
- This?  - Yeah. Can you open it?

276
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
It's empty.

277
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,940
Are there any identifying marks on it?

278
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,610
Some kind of logo engraved near the lock.

279
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,280
Let me see. Zoom in.

280
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Zoom in.

281
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,950
Make sure that gets on the next transport back here.

282
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,960
Will do.

283
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,460
Sarah. I need you to do a corporate logo search.

284
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,920
I may have found a link between the train crash and Heller's abduction.

285
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm sending it to you now.

286
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,340
Okay. We'll pick this up later.

287
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,090
The man I recognized at the warehouse... I want to make that ID.

288
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,890
After you get checked out by the clinic.

289
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,180
I'll get the photos ready.

290
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,390
Excuse me, Ms. Raines. This way, please.

291
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,810
It's all right. Go ahead.

292
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,830
I'm going to need to use your station.

293
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,540
Have Driscoll send me over a passcode for the onsite feed.

294
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,500
- Okay.  - Thanks.

295
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
Does he know?

296
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,840
About you and Jack.

297
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,180
How long have you known?

298
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,310
Not until today. Although I'm surprised that I hadn't figured it out till now.

299
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,770
But it's not what you think.

300
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,230
Paul and I were over before Jack and I started seeing each other.

301
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,980
Except Paul doesn't think it's over.

302
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,440
Last time I spoke with him,

303
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,980
he thought he had a second chance.

304
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,240
Yeah, well, that's more about fixing his wounded pride

305
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,740
than fixing this relationship.

306
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,450
So he doesn't know about it.

307
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,450
Not yet.

308
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,160
I'll take care of it.

309
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,070
Sarah said you may have found a thread connecting

310
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,660
the train bombing to Heller's abduction.

311
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,240
Yeah. About an hour ago,

312
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,580
NTSB reported that a passenger was killed,

313
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,000
but not as a result of the crash.

314
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,170
He was shot at close range.

315
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,170
Who is he?

316
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,460
We're still trying to find out.

317
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,840
He had no I.D.

318
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,500
His face and prints don't show up on any database.

319
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,300
But whoever killed him stole something he had chained to his wrist.

320
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,590
I think it may have been this.

321
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,850
A witness on the train saw a man with a briefcase handcuffed to him.

322
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,060
Take a look at the damage.

323
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,190
It could have been sustained during the crash.

324
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,070
We just recovered this where Heller was being held.

325
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,650
What are you telling me?

326
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,860
That the train bombing was a cover for the theft of this briefcase?

327
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,120
- What was in it?  - It was empty.

328
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,950
We traced the corporate logo on the briefcase

329
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,790
to McLennen-Forster.

330
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,670
- The defense contractor?  - Yeah.

331
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,340
Have you contacted them?

332
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,130
Just got off the phone with their CEO. He stonewalled.

333
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,760
Said before he disclosed anything,

334
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,090
we'd need special clearance from the Department of Defense.

335
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,890
The Secretary should be able to get us whatever clearances we need from DOD.

336
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,720
Let's get a printout of all this.

337
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,230
Yeah.

338
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,580
The girl's mother went home.

339
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,370
Even if she calls the police, it will be too late.

340
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,420
I heard the news in the car. Everything was accomplished?

341
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,590
Yes. The trial was cut short, but it served its purpose.

342
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,350
When they search the warehouse,

343
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,890
will they figure out what we're doing?

344
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,520
It doesn't matter.

345
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,060
It's too late for them to stop it.

346
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,360
If everything is working on schedule,

347
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,650
why do you look so troubled?

348
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,790
Where is Behrooz?

349
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,000
He went to bury the girl.

350
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,750
But his car is still in the driveway.

351
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,420
He didn't take the car.

352
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,760
I don't understand.

353
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,140
He went with Tariq.

354
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,940
Tariq was here?

355
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,200
Oh, my God. He's going to kill my son.

356
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,080
Oh, my God. He's going to kill our son.

357
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,130
Yes.

358
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,630
I told Madwan that Behrooz took care of the girl.

359
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,010
Madwan must not have been satisfied.

360
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,680
He must have decided that Behrooz was a liability.

361
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,550
How could you let this happen?

362
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,510
How could you let them kill our son?

363
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,100
What could I do? What could I do?!

364
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,690
He's our son! Our flesh and blood!

365
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,400
Listen to me.

366
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,320
How could you let them kill our son!

367
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,280
Behrooz stopped being our son a long time ago.

368
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,780
- How can you say that?  - Because it's true.

369
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,240
Living here has changed him.

370
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,120
He's been like a stranger to us.

371
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,200
He proved it to me today that he no longer believes in our cause.

372
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,920
Maybe...

373
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,130
he never did.

374
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,550
Behrooz...

375
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,100
Behrooz... Oh, my God. Behrooz...

376
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,530
Secretary Heller would like to say a few words.

377
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,210
I'm incredibly privileged

378
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,880
to have the finest people in the world behind me. All of you.

379
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,180
It's going to take lot more than a few words to express my feelings,

380
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,890
but for now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

381
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,610
Secretary Heller, Curtis Manning, head of Tactical.

382
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,320
- Curtis.  - An honor, sir.

383
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,030
Please, sit down.

384
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,450
Erin, my daughter and I owe you our lives.

385
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,620
It sounds like you had to make some tough calls,

386
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,000
but you made the right ones.

387
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,130
I'll see to it that you get full recognition

388
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,010
for a job exceptionally well done.

389
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,510
Thank you, sir.

390
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,930
Now, before we start the debriefing,

391
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,390
I'd like to visit with my son. Where is he?

392
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,810
We're actually holding Richard here, sir.

393
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,150
Why is that?

394
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,650
When we brought Richard in, we gave him a polygraph.

395
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,530
It indicated that he was possibly withholding information from us.

396
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,160
About my kidnapping?

397
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,870
My son and I have wildly different political views,

398
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,960
but I can't believe that he was involved.

399
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,540
We don't think he had knowing participation,

400
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,250
but we believe he shared knowledge of your whereabouts this morning with someone,

401
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,510
and he refuses to divulge their information or their identity.

402
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,260
And what are you doing about that?

403
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,890
We discussed a number of options.

404
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,010
You have to understand the circumstances.

405
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,640
Stop BS'ing me. What did you do to him?

406
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,730
There's a technique that's noninvasive

407
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,150
called sensory disorientation.

408
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,150
You subjected my son to SDT?

409
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,980
Yes, sir, we did.

410
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,530
But it was stopped the moment you were rescued.

411
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,240
Jack, did you know about this?

412
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,530
No, sir.

413
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,030
- I want to see my son now  - Of course. Curtis.

414
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,040
Erin, I realize you've been under a lot of pressure these past few hours,

415
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,500
but you better have cause for this.

416
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,590
Jack?

417
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,840
I appreciate you not involving the Secretary

418
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,260
in the differences you and I had on this operation.

419
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,510
We both did what we thought was right.

420
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,310
I'd like to put the past behind us, Jack. I could use your help.

421
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,140
What do you need?

422
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,150
I'd like you to function in Ronnie's position as head of Field Ops

423
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,980
until we avert this crisis.

424
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,400
Whatever I can do to help.

425
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,490
Let me make one thing clear.

426
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,830
Ronnie was under my command, and you will be, too.

427
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,700
Understood.

428
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,750
The photos from the warehouse are they ready for Audrey Raines to see?

429
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,080
I believe so.

430
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,590
I'll have Edgar port them to a workstation.

431
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,880
Okay. Thank you.

432
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,050
Dad.

433
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,230
They said you were okay.

434
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,100
Audrey, too. Thank God.

435
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,530
I said some awf... awful things before.

436
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,910
I was afraid I'd never get a chance to apologize.

437
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,790
I said some pretty harsh things myself.

438
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,670
But, no matter what was said, you're still my son,

439
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,670
and I will always love you.

440
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,750
Me, too, Dad.

441
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,010
They said they were using some interrogation techniques.

442
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,600
They were totally out of line.

443
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,690
I am going to sue them blind.

444
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,610
I think it'll be a little more effective if you let me deal with it.

445
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,900
I promise you, if they were out of line, heads will roll.

446
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,910
What do you mean, "if"?

447
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,740
Why did they think you were holding something back from them?

448
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,500
I don't know.

449
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,840
Richard, if you know something that would shed some light on what happened to me...

450
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,010
What, you don't think I would tell them if I thought as relevant?

451
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,090
So there is something?

452
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,840
Now you're giving me the third degree?

453
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,760
Son, do you have any idea what your sister just went through?

454
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,140
If you know anything that would help us find

455
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,850
the people behind this, tell me now.

456
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,940
Dad...

457
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,070
I'm glad you're alive.

458
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,190
I... I really am.

459
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,650
But I do not need to tell these people things about my private life

460
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,240
that they don't need to know.

461
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,330
That you don't think they need to know.

462
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,250
Richard, these people were trying to save our lives!

463
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,590
These people can't be trusted! What they did to me is proof.

464
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,590
Agent Manning, could you come in here, please?

465
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:23,360
Agent Manning, I am authorizing you to do whatever you feel is necessary,

466
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,690
to get this information out of my son.

467
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,780
Dad...

468
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,120
I love you, son, but I have a duty to my country.

469
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,450
You can't be serious.

470
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,710
Dad!

471
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Bring the shovels from the back.

472
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,050
Come on. Help me.

473
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,050
They said it was okay to come in.

474
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,100
Hi, Paul.

475
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,730
My God, I was so worried.

476
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,810
You hurt?

477
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,940
No, just some cuts and scrapes, nothing serious.

478
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,740
- Sure?  - Yeah, really. I'm okay, Paul.

479
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,490
They've okayed me for my debriefing.

480
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:52,760
On the flight over, I couldn't stop thinking about us.

481
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,890
How when we separated we said that we'd both

482
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,890
take time to figure out what we wanted and...

483
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,690
- Now I know.  - Paul.

484
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:08,310
I want us to be together again. I'm ready to work at it.

485
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,650
I'll make our marriage first priority.

486
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,530
Just give us a chance.

487
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,750
I'm sorry, Paul.

488
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,330
That's not what I want.

489
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,250
Audrey, I...

490
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,840
I am a fool for bringing this up now.

491
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,260
You can't make decisions about our relationship when you're in this state.

492
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,510
Paul.

493
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,980
I'm seeing someone.

494
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,150
Well, how long has this been going on?

495
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,820
Six months.

496
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,240
You love him, or...?

497
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,160
Yes.

498
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,620
Audrey?

499
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,290
I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'll come back later.

500
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,920
No. Um...

501
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,220
Paul, this is Jack Bauer.

502
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,680
Nice to meet you.

503
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,100
You're the one that saved Audrey's life.

504
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,220
Thank you.

505
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,230
You're welcome.

506
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,690
Those photos are ready for you to look at.

507
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,690
Okay.

508
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,900
Um, Paul, we'll talk later?

509
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,200
Yeah.

510
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,350
- You all right?  - Yeah.

511
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,060
You ready to go?

512
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,980
Not yet.

513
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,750
Now I am.

514
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,230
No.

515
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,400
No.

516
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,900
You're absolutely certain you saw this guy before in the compound.

517
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,400
Positive, and I could tell that he recognized me.

518
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,650
Okay.

519
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,070
No.

520
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,450
No.

521
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,990
That's all of them.

522
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,240
He must have gotten out before the rescue.

523
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,700
Okay, we should go through the pictures again just to make sure.

524
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,000
I will, but there are only two men here who aren't Middle Eastern,

525
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,620
and neither one of them are him.

526
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,010
What?

527
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,380
I just remembered where I saw him before.

528
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,590
Where?

529
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,390
There was a Heritage Foundation dinner about two months ago,

530
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,890
at the Hyatt downtown, here.

531
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,270
Do you remember his name?

532
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,940
No, but I know someone at the foundation. Maybe I can get the guest list.

533
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,810
- Okay, good.  - Bauer?

534
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,270
Driscoll wants you in a conference call that's starting in a few minutes.

535
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,230
Okay, fine.

536
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,860
I need you to get ahold of the Hyatt hotel security department.

537
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,950
Get access to their archival video surveillance.

538
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,280
Audrey will give you a time and a date.

539
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,160
Set a parameter, keep Driscoll informed.

540
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,280
I'll be right back.

541
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,930
It's hot.

542
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,260
You brought me here to kill me! Why?!

543
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,980
Why are you doing this?!

544
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,400
I did everything they told me to do.

545
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,850
You know why.

546
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,940
I took care of the girl. Madwan knows!

547
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,780
It's not Madwan that wants you dead.

548
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,320
Who wants me dead?

549
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,950
Who?!

550
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,080
Who wants me dead?

551
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,830
I want to know! Tell me!

552
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,000
Your father.

553
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,340
No!

554
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,380
No!

555
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,880
It's not true.

556
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,720
No! No!

557
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,910
Please!

558
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,250
No!

559
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,880
Please!

560
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,000
No!

561
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,090
Mr. Reese, I'm Erin Driscoll, Director of CTU Los Angeles.

562
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,970
My colleagues Curtis Manning and Sarah Gavin are also present.

563
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,060
Also, Jack Bauer who's Special Advisor to Secretary Heller.

564
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,640
Ms. Driscoll, I hope you understand.

565
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,770
We at McLennen-Forster couldn't give you details

566
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,060
about that case until we received the appropriate permission from DOD.

567
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,190
Understood, Mr. Reese. May we please begin?

568
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,360
What was your courier transporting?

569
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,690
It's a device we developed

570
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,070
under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Emergency Management Program.

571
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,370
It's a Dobson-type override.

572
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,660
What exactly does this override do?

573
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,580
It combination of hard ware and soft ware

574
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,580
that can remotely take control of a nuclear power facility.

575
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,460
Under what circumstances would the override be used?

576
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,590
The government would be able to control a plant's nuclear pile

577
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,630
in the event of a disaster that necessitated evacuation.

578
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,680
And the person in possession of this program, could they the opoosite with it?

579
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,010
Create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown?

580
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,470
Theoretically, yes.

581
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,640
But merely having possession of the override wouldn't be enough.

582
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,980
There are safeguards in place.

583
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,440
What kind of safeguards?

584
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,940
Anyone who's trying to use the override

585
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,190
would have to hack through the reactor's firewall.

586
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,110
That would take massive computer power,

587
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,400
which NRC could see coming mile away.

588
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,860
Is it possible that NRC could miss this

589
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,330
due to unusually heavy traffic on the Internet?

590
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,290
I don't follow.

591
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,040
Well, less than an hour ago, millions of computers around the world

592
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,500
were streaming the trial of the Secretary of Defense.

593
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,460
Is it possible that this trial was just some kind of a Trojan horse

594
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,010
to disguise a massive attack on nuclear power plants' firewalls?

595
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,430
That might be possible.

596
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,930
How many nuclear power plants in this country would be vulnerable?

597
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,890
All of them.

598
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,810
How many is that?

599
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,810
At this time, the United States has 104 nuclear power plants online.

600
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,730
We have to assume that they've used this override to take over the plants.

601
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,190
Get me NRC now and find Secretary Heller.

602
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,650
Thank you, Mr. Reese.

603
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,860
Set up an all-department briefing.

604
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,160
Get me NRC now. Pipe it through here.

605
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,530
I want all personnel in the conference area.

606
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,080
Edgar...

607
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,790
can you monitor my allocation tables for a few minutes?

608
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,250
Sure.

609
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,440
- Yes?  - It's me.

610
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,610
You're on a secure line?

611
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,610
Yes.

612
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,200
I would've checked in sooner but this was the first chance I got.

613
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,280
Alright. Go on.

614
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,910
They found out about the override.

615
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


616
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,130
Put down the gun!

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,900
Put the gun down now! Drop it, now! Step back!

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
I'll kill her!

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,700
I will kill her!

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,760
Jack, when I was inside, I recognized

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,330
- one of the men.  - Who?

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,600
I can't place him,

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,400
but I know that I saw him before today.

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,830
Why did they think you were

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,700
holding something back from them?

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,430
I will not tell these people

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
things about my private life that they don't need to know.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,100
That you don't think they need to know.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,660
Your mother told Madwan you took care

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,930
of the American girl?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,930
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then you'll need help

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,200
getting rid of the body.

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,600
He's going to kill our son.

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,300
Yes.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,430
You brought me here to kill me!

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,960
I took care of the girl!

24
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,100
Madwan knows!

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,560
It's not Madwan that wants you dead!

26
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,200
Who wants me dead?

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,800
Your father.

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,800
Thank you so much for helping me out.

29
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,230
They said Maya's arrived?

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,330
She's in the exam area.

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,630
I'm about to do her work-up.

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,600
She suffers from schizophrenia.

33
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,300
I want us to be together again.

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm sorry, Paul.

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm seeing someone.

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,000
Paul, this is Jack Bauer.

37
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,360
Nice to meet you.

38
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,200
What was your courier transporting?

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,330
A Dobson-type override.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,660
What exactly does this override do?

41
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,260
It's a combination of hardware and software

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,630
that can remotely take control of a nuclear power facility.

43
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,560
And the person in possession of this program,

44
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,030
could they do the opposite with it?

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,760
Create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown?

46
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,600
Theoretically, yes.

47
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,360
How many nuclear power plants in this country

48
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,430
would be vulnerable?

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,100
All of them.

50
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,930
- Yes?  - It's me.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,900
They found out about the override.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,460
Jack, did you get the surveillance footage from

53
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,200
- Hyatt Security?  - No, they heard each dinner that

54
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,130
you attended was monitored by a private company...

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,230
Felsted Security... I just got off the phone with them.

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,360
They've got the videotapes on file, but unfortunately,

57
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,800
they're working off a closed system.

58
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,430
I've got to go there, pick up the tapes,

59
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
bring them back here for you to I.D.

60
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,360
Where are you on the guest list?

61
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,530
I'm having it sent here.

62
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,260
You know, we're running out of time.

63
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,630
What do you mean? Is it that urgent?

64
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,130
Yes. As it turns out, your kidnapping was just a cover

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,260
for a much larger attack. The terrorists used

66
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,430
the broadcast of the trial to overload the Internet,

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,230
and diverted all of our attention away from

68
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,460
what they were really trying to do.

69
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,500
I need a full tactical

70
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,900
for my vehicle.

71
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,600
Which is what?

72
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,500
They're in possession of a stolen device called an override.

73
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,900
With that, they've gained control

74
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,100
of the 104 nuclear power plants across this country.

75
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,860
The override device maintains heat levels within the reactors.

76
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,460
Effectively, they can meltdown

77
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,860
every one of those plants.

78
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,860
Oh, God... my God.

79
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,100
Thank you.

80
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,730
The man you saw when you were being held captive,

81
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
right now, he's our only lead.

82
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,500
Then let me come to Felsted Security with you

83
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,660
- and make the I.D. there. It'll be quicker.  - Audrey, I can't.

84
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,300
After what you've been through today,

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm not going to put you at risk.

86
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,960
You just said our nation's nuclear power plants

87
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,300
will melt down if we don't find that override, Jack.

88
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,560
We can't afford to waste any more time.

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Come over here.

90
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,560
There are 104 nuclear power stations in the United States.

91
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,230
We just learned that terrorists

92
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,230
are trying to convert all 104 nuclear cores into weapons.

93
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,930
Give us the worst-case casualty scenarios, Curtis.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,730
This graphic represents a single meltdown scenario.

95
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Edgar, break it down for us.

96
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,200
If we can't wrest control of the override,

97
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,900
it will shut down the entire cooling system

98
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,130
and the core will melt through the containment building.

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,430
In the first three hours,

100
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,160
the population within a ten-mile radius

101
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,300
will receive the highest doses of radiation.

102
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,730
Most people will die within two days.

103
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,230
Now, the smallest of these 104 cities

104
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,160
represents 75,000 people.

105
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,460
Multiply that by 104,

106
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,030
we're looking at three million casualties,

107
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,630
and that's conservative.

108
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,800
The environmental impact

109
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,700
would also be catastrophic.

110
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,200
30 miles in all directions of each plant

111
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,560
will be uninhabitable for at least five years.

112
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,530
Don't these plants have multiple security systems

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
to prevent this kind of breech?

114
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,160
They do, but the override

115
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,800
has already deactivated them.

116
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,460
And if we don't succeed,

117
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,530
how long before these cores start to melt down?

118
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,660
I'm projecting the first radiation shock waves

119
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,060
in approximately three hours.

120
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,760
All right, I want everyone here from Com and Logistics

121
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,160
to work on getting a handle

122
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,700
on the software.

123
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,230
The rest of you will handle support in conjunction

124
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,660
with NRC personnel.

125
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,360
Let's get to work.

126
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,700
Erin, we're leaving now.

127
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,230
Where you going, Jack?

128
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,660
Audrey's given us a significant lead. We need to follow it up.

129
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,860
- What kind of lead?  - When we were being held,

130
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,900
I recognized someone. He was an American. I saw him at

131
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,630
a function here in L.A. a couple months ago.

132
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,630
We're going to view the surveillance tapes of the function

133
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,360
at a private security company not far from here.

134
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,460
I don't want her going out now.

135
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,830
Why can't you access the tapes here?

136
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,630
Sir, I wish we could, but they're off line.

137
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,860
They would have to record over four and a half hours

138
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,130
of material for us to view. We don't have that time.

139
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,130
Jack told me that these people are trying to use

140
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,700
our nuclear power plants as weapons. We have to follow

141
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,300
this lead, and we have to follow it now.

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,660
Sir, Audrey's the only person

143
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,260
who can make this I.D.

144
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,500
If anything happens, Jack,

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
I will hold you personally responsible.

146
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,300
I understand.

147
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,000
How far away is this facility?

148
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,460
Not far. Burbank.

149
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,130
Audrey...

150
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,560
Paul.

151
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,800
I'll get the team set up.

152
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,830
We need to talk.

153
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,060
We'll have to do it when I get back.

154
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,060
Get back from where?

155
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,030
We're following up on something.

156
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,800
Paul, please... can we just do this later?

157
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,800
How many on your team?

158
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,830
Four of us.

159
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,160
Set up a weapons package.

160
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,260
I'll meet you in the motor pool. Done.

161
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,030
... cannot see each other anymore.

162
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,700
Look, I don't know about all of this,

163
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,030
but I know about you and him,

164
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,160
I am not okay with that.

165
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,860
Look, you and I aren't together anymore.

166
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,730
I thought we were trying to work things out.

167
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,860
Yeah, I tried, but you kept putting it off.

168
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,130
So I gave up.

169
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,860
We haven't been together for over nine months.

170
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,660
We're not trying to work out anything anymore.

171
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,400
Mr. Raines, I'm sorry to interrupt.

172
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,800
- She is my wife.  - Paul, please.

173
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,560
Excuse me.

174
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
She's my wife.

175
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,960
Don't you forget that.

176
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah.

177
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,300
Let's go.

178
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,800
Jack, I'm sorry.

179
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,800
It's fine.

180
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,400
Hey, I just received these files from DOD.

181
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,300
I need to give them to Jack Bauer.

182
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Oh, you can't. Jack just left.

183
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,360
Oh, well, um, can I forward them to him?

184
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,660
No, he went

185
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,060
with Audrey Raines to Felsted Security

186
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,460
to look at some archive footage.

187
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,730
Okay... well, I guess I can just hold on to them for him.

188
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,200
Yeah, that'd be fine.

189
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,800
Paul.

190
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,930
Jim,

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,430
we need to talk.

192
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,030
Come in here.

193
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,630
Did you know about Audrey and Jack Bauer?

194
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,400
Not till an hour ago.

195
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,900
Well, I've got to tell you,

196
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,460
they were carrying on right under your nose.

197
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,660
It's pretty unprofessional, wouldn't you say?

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,000
Look, I understand your feelings about this,

199
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,130
but you and Audrey

200
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,430
have been separated for almost a year.

201
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,400
Paul, I'm sorry,

202
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,560
but she's a big girl.

203
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,760
She can do what she wants.

204
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, what she's doing is she...

205
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,460
she's breaking my heart.

206
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,800
Maryanne...

207
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,930
Sarah.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,300
What do you need back here?

209
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,930
Um... Edgar asked me to do a manual reboot of Hub Five.

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,130
Oh, I can do that for him.

211
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,060
No, no, it's fine.

212
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,030
Okay.

213
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,760
Yes?

214
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,900
Bauer and Audrey Raines left here about five minutes ago.

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Where'd they go?

216
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,030
Felsted Security.

217
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,330
357 White Oak Boulevard.

218
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,700
It's in Burbank.

219
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
All right, good.

220
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,900
You're going to need to set things up on your end.

221
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,230
What are you talking about?

222
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,860
I should be done here.

223
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,400
No. When Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed,

224
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,800
CTU is going to know that someone inside leaked the location.

225
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,730
All right. What do I do?

226
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,060
Divert suspicion.

227
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,830
Fine.

228
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,560
I'm standing live in an area just outside of the perimeter.

229
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,030
Unfortunately, the Pentagon is not commenting at this time.

230
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,960
But what we do know is that at 12:10 p.m.,

231
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,360
Secretary Heller and his daughter, Audrey Raines,

232
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,230
were successfully rescued.

233
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,930
The number of fatalities is unknown,

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,660
but sources say there might have been

235
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,930
as many as 20 terrorists

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,730
inside the building at the time,

237
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,460
and it appears there are no survivors among them.

238
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,400
- It is also unclear as to...  - Yes?

239
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,160
It looks like all the critical instructions went with him,

240
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,760
before the assault.

241
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,860
Yes.

242
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,760
The override has taken control of the nuclear power plants.

243
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,860
What about Behrooz?

244
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,000
What about our son?

245
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
We have to be strong now.

246
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,630
We'll mourn him when this is over.

247
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,630
... and as you might imagine, among the most difficult of days

248
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,830
for Secretary Heller and his daughter.

249
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,400
The Secret Service was previously

250
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,160
swarming over this area to secure it,

251
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,800
but have since taken the Secretary

252
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,230
to an undisclosed location for his safety.

253
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,830
We hope to have more information,

254
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,300
as officials are preparing to make a public statement.

255
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,730
Hello?

256
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,900
Mom?

257
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,060
Behrooz?

258
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,230
Are you all right?

259
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,530
Tariq tried to kill me.

260
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,260
He was going to shoot me.

261
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,300
I had to defend myself.

262
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,400
What did you do?

263
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,700
I killed him.

264
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,530
You can't let Father know.

265
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,560
Why not?

266
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,900
Because Father is the one

267
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
who told Tariq to do it.

268
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,930
He wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie.

269
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
Behrooz, that's not possible.

270
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,960
Your father would never want to hurt you.

271
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,300
It's true.

272
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,660
Mom, I don't know what to do.

273
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,260
You have to help me.

274
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,530
Where are you now?

275
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,030
I'm near the Metrolink station

276
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,860
on Lassen in Chatsworth.

277
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,300
Are you using Tariq's car?

278
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,600
Yes.

279
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,700
Hide it. I'll pick you up there in a half hour.

280
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,700
Hurry.

281
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,300
Who was on the phone?

282
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,460
It was nothing important.

283
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,660
Liar.

284
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,000
What did Behrooz do?

285
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,560
No, what did you do?

286
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,000
Did you give the order?

287
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,360
Behrooz was not committed.

288
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,660
It was just a matter of time

289
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,960
before he turned against us.

290
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,130
You ordered Tariq to kill him.

291
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,460
To kill our own son.

292
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,930
No, no, no, you...

293
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,800
Where is Tariq?

294
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,200
Behrooz killed him.

295
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,360
That's impossible.

296
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,100
Because you think he's weak?

297
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,430
He's not.

298
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,600
Nothing... nothing will stand in the way

299
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,730
of what needs to be done.

300
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,260
Not him,

301
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,230
not you.

302
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Where is he now?

303
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,330
Why?

304
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,900
What are you going to do?

305
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,730
You're hurting me.

306
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
I will do more than that.

307
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,830
Now you listen to me, woman.

308
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,530
You will do exactly as you told him.

309
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,230
You will pick him up in a half an hour.

310
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,350
What did you say to Paul?

311
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,490
That I'm filing for divorce as soon as I get back to D.C.

312
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,150
Are you sure that's what you want?

313
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,780
Yes.

314
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,290
Okay.

315
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,150
Yes!

316
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,590
Do you have something?

317
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,350
It looks like the Dobson override device

318
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,880
hasn't completely taken control of all the reactors.

319
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,980
- I'm starting to get some response.  - What could I do?

320
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,180
Nothing. Just stay off Hub Five. I need it.

321
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,520
I thought Hub Five was out for a reboot.

322
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,850
No.

323
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,450
Curtis! Come here!

324
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,520
Could I talk to you for a minute?

325
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,390
Actually, I'm kind of busy.

326
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,520
You lied to me about doing a reboot for Edgar.

327
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,920
Yes, I did.

328
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,950
Why?

329
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,150
Sarah, I had a personal call to make,

330
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,920
and I knew it would be inappropriate

331
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,180
at the time of the crisis.

332
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,690
I didn't want anyone to know.

333
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,220
Then why'd you do it in here?

334
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,820
Why didn't you just go outside?

335
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,750
I was trying to make it look like I was working, okay?

336
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,880
Look, I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

337
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,880
It's Madwan.

338
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,850
Yes.

339
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,050
Has Tariq taken care of your son?

340
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,150
I haven't spoken to Tariq yet, but I'm sure

341
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
if there was a problem, he would've called me.

342
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,550
The fact that I'm even talking to you about this is a problem.

343
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,920
The next two hours are crucial.

344
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,290
I can't be distracted by this.

345
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,420
I understand.

346
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,920
I promise,

347
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,750
I will personally oversee the situation

348
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,220
and make sure it is resolved.

349
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,350
Fix this, Navi.

350
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,320
Of course.

351
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,520
What is Madwan going to say

352
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,920
if he finds out Behrooz killed Tariq?

353
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,550
Tariq is expendable, like we all are.

354
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,820
Madwan understands that.

355
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,780
All he cares about is that Behrooz is silenced.

356
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,220
I will not be able to look at you after today

357
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,090
without thinking about what we did to him.

358
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,550
I think I got it.

359
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,120
- What?  - The Dobson override.

360
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,120
I think I've got a piece of the code.

361
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,420
What does that mean?

362
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,420
If this is really it, I can turn off the override,

363
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,250
and stop the remaining plants from melting down.

364
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,520
What do you need?

365
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,480
To get into the software kernel, but the NRC

366
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,150
- will never let me. It's too dangerous.  - Why?

367
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,580
If I tinker in there and screw up,

368
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,150
I can start a chain reaction.

369
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,550
All right, Edgar.

370
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,190
I'm going to need you to present this to Heller.

371
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,520
He can order NRC to let you in.

372
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,680
Present to Heller?

373
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,920
Yeah, he's in the situation room.

374
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,550
I shouldn't do this, Curtis.

375
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,850
- Why not?  - I could faint.

376
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,720
I feel very nauseous. I have low blood sugar.

377
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,150
It's just Driscoll and Heller.

378
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,390
Driscoll's in there, too?

379
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,720
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.

380
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,290
I'm going to have to interrupt you.

381
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,780
- What is it?  - This is Edgar Stiles, our chief analyst.

382
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,950
He's requesting access to the kernels

383
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,050
of the power plants.

384
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,250
My understanding is that

385
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,120
no one is to manipulate those kernels

386
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,750
while the plants are on line.

387
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,320
Yes, but there is a way to do it if you're careful.

388
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,550
I'd have to stay away from the pre-compiled headers,

389
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,990
while I was putting the software lock

390
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,220
on the Dobson override code.

391
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,050
But the chances of causing a load imbalance...

392
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,180
I don't understand one thing you're talking about.

393
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,820
Just tell me what the downside is

394
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,620
if the kernels are disrupted

395
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,020
because of your manipulation.

396
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,920
If I make a mistake, I can accelerate

397
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
a core meltdown in some of the reactors.

398
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,280
This is probably a bad idea. Maybe we shouldn't do it.

399
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,750
But if you're successful,

400
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,950
you can regain control of the reactors?

401
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,180
Yes.

402
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,880
Edgar, what we need to know is can you do this

403
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,490
without making a mistake?

404
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,790
Yeah, I can do it.

405
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,390
You're not filling me with confidence, Edgar.

406
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,050
Look...

407
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,080
I'm just a little nervous.

408
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,390
But if I say I can do it, I can do it.

409
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,380
He'll run away the moment he sees you.

410
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,480
He won't see me.

411
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,790
You'll be the only one in the car

412
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,380
when you pick him up.

413
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,380
It's Behrooz.

414
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,280
Answer it.

415
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,050
Hello?

416
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,280
Are you almost here?

417
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,950
Yes.

418
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,220
What did you tell Dad?

419
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,920
I didn't. I just left.

420
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,920
He was busy working.

421
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,020
What are we going to do?

422
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,050
Wherever we go, he'll find us.

423
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,020
No, he won't. I know a safe place.

424
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,020
I didn't understand, until today, what it would feel like.

425
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,950
Doing these things... they're wrong, Mom.

426
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,920
And I see it now.

427
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,790
Don't think about that anymore.

428
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,650
You'll be safe now.

429
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
But I am thinking about it.

430
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,720
Maybe I should go to the police and tell them everything I know.

431
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,990
We'll talk about it when I get there.

432
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,620
Okay.

433
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,320
You did well.

434
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,380
Who are they?

435
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,950
Don't worry about it.

436
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,180
Just make sure you take the second exit at Angeles Crest.

437
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,910
He's going to ask me why I'm stopping.

438
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,710
Let him ask.

439
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,850
What do I tell him?

440
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,580
Don't tell him anything.

441
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,350
We'll meet you there.

442
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,010
Erin? We're making good progress.

443
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,210
- Tell me.  - We've been able to take

444
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,050
87 power plants off line, they're safe.

445
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,810
- What about the other 17?  - The terrorists were able to use the override

446
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,050
to block a shutdown.

447
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,750
Everything we're trying is being repelled.

448
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,480
What are we doing to get around it?

449
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,410
Believe me, Erin, we're trying everything.

450
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,010
If there's a way, we'll find it.

451
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,610
I'll keep you posted.

452
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,280
Sweetheart?

453
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,250
Mom.

454
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,080
- How are you feeling?  - Not good.

455
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,780
I don't like these doctors.

456
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,050
I want Dr. Runwith.

457
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,550
You can't see him today. You can't see him today.

458
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,550
Why not?

459
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,150
Because I can't leave here.

460
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,380
And I want you close by.

461
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,410
Then stay here with me.

462
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,780
I'll be back in a few minutes, I promise.

463
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,780
But you have to do something for me, okay?

464
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,610
I want you to do something.

465
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,780
Look at me. Maya, look at me.

466
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,480
You need to cooperate with the doctors.

467
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,850
Okay?

468
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,280
Okay.

469
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,910
Okay.

470
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,480
Come on.

471
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,580
I'll be back.

472
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,680
I promise.

473
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,880
Take these, please.

474
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,410
Your son was in sensory deprivation

475
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,880
for a total of two and a half hours.

476
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,580
What did he say when you took him off it?

477
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,880
Nothing.

478
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,410
You tortured my son for almost three hours

479
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,510
and ended up yielding nothing?

480
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,010
You gave the order, sir.

481
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,380
Give us a moment, please.

482
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,510
I'm sorry this had to happen, Richard,

483
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,780
but we had to make sure

484
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,310
that you weren't withholding anything from us.

485
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,750
I hate you.

486
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,180
I never want to see you again.

487
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,850
Please understand that I am responsible

488
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,710
for the lives of millions of people.

489
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,250
You torture me and now you want me to forgive you?

490
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,210
This just confirms everything I always knew about you.

491
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,050
Am I free to leave?

492
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,850
Yes.

493
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,710
Yeah, Paul.

494
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,310
Audrey, do you have a minute?

495
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,280
Sure, what's going on?

496
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,510
I just talked to your dad, and he said something to me

497
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,150
that I've been thinking about it a lot.

498
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,550
He said that you're a big girl,

499
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,580
and I think I've been treating you like a child.

500
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,180
I don't think that, Paul.

501
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,950
Well, whether it comes off that way or not,

502
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,380
I need to respect your choices, respect who you are

503
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,180
and... 

504
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,710
I've been so stupid about all of this.

505
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,180
I've lost sight of the things I love about you.

506
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,150
Look, uh...

507
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,750
I hear what you're saying, but I don't...

508
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,180
I don't really know how to respond to that.

509
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,450
Well, you don't have to.

510
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,950
I just want you to know that

511
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,150
I've been wrong about a lot of things

512
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,480
and before you make any big decisions,

513
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,880
decisions that you're entitled to make,

514
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,550
let some time go by.

515
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,710
Is that fair?

516
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,980
Is that fair of me to ask?

517
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,880
Yeah. Yeah, that's fair.

518
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,910
Okay, well, I'll, uh...

519
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,080
I'll see you later.

520
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,710
Yeah. See you later.

521
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,550
How far out are we?

522
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,710
A few miles away, sir.

523
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,410
Okay.

524
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,580
Where are we going to go?

525
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,010
Out of the city.

526
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,350
Why did Father

527
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,810
want to kill me? I'm his son.

528
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,410
Stop, Behrooz, you can't

529
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,650
think about that now. Get in.

530
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,880
Get in.

531
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,750
Mom, we killed two people today.

532
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,680
I can't do this. I'm freaking out.

533
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,410
Shh.

534
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,010
Get on the train.

535
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,780
What?

536
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,480
Your father's following us.

537
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,710
What?!

538
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,510
It was the only way I could save you.

539
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,510
Now, damn it,

540
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,150
Behrooz, get out, go.

541
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,250
Go!

542
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,410
Obey me!

543
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,680
- Oh, God!  - Mom!

544
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,050
- Mom!  - Oh, God!

545
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,110
Go!

546
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,350
Watch out!

547
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,530
Is it taken care of?

548
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,330
No, there's a problem.

549
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,270
My wife and Behrooz have betrayed us.

550
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,830
Where are they now?

551
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't know.

552
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,430
But Dina's been wounded.

553
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,600
She'll have to get medical attention.

554
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,870
So you've come to me asking me for help with this mess?

555
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,570
I can't do it alone, Madwan.

556
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,770
I'm ashamed of myself.

557
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,170
Allow me to make this right.

558
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,170
What would you need?

559
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,870
To monitor local hospitals.

560
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,300
I'll also need drivers,

561
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,100
as well as access

562
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,300
to police frequencies.

563
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,230
You think she'll go to the police?

564
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,400
No, no.

565
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,700
But they may pick her up if they find out

566
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,270
she's been shot.

567
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,430
I told you...

568
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,770
I can't be distracted by this right now.

569
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,130
Give him what he needs.

570
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,300
Make sure the woman and child are captured

571
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,530
before they can do us harm.

572
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,300
Thank you. Thank you, Madwan.

573
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,930
No matter what happens today,

574
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,700
you will answer for this.

575
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,100
I understand.

576
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,870
No, we just got here.

577
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,030
How long is it going to take you to create the database?

578
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,200
Okay.

579
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,400
Okay, Marcie, thanks.

580
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,000
Our office just got a copy of the guest list

581
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,800
from the dinner where you saw this guy.

582
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,200
Once you make an I.D. on the surveillance tape, we'll be able

583
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,730
to send it through a database, and we'll find out who it is.

584
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,000
- Okay.  - I'm carrying.

585
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,900
Yeah.

586
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,000
Jack, this is Maryanne Taylor at CTU.

587
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,070
- What is it, Maryanne?  - Curtis wanted me to tell you

588
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,870
that as soon as Audrey recognizes somebody

589
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,130
from the surveillance video,

590
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,770
he wants it sent directly to my system.

591
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,770
I'm on 60 Casper.

592
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,270
Why didn't he tell me himself?

593
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,930
They're still trying to shut down

594
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,530
all the remaining power plants,

595
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,900
and everybody else is still working on that.

596
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,900
Are they going to be able to control them in time?

597
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,300
I don't know.

598
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,900
Okay, keep me informed.

599
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,400
What is it?

600
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,130
We don't have a lot of time.

601
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,230
She seems to be doing better now. She's sleeping.

602
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,930
Oh, that's very good news.

603
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,800
Did you give her Haldol?

604
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,930
Mm-hmm. Why?

605
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,670
She's allergic to it. It's in her file!

606
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,530
The date on this is gone. This is the wrong file.

607
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,770
Maya! Maya!

608
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,730
Maya? She's unconscious!

609
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,030
Mary, we have a code!

610
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,200
I need 25 cc's of norepinephrine.

611
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,570
How could you have gotten the wrong file?

612
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,300
Excuse me, please step away, I need that syringe now.

613
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,770
Ms. Driscoll,

614
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,600
Secretary Hel...

615
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,930
What is it, Sarah?

616
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,170
Sarah!

617
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,900
Secretary Heller needs you.

618
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,100
For what? He's going online

619
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,170
with the President

620
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,700
in a few minutes and he wants to know

621
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,000
about our progress on the reactors.

622
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,570
Um, tell him that

623
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,070
they're still trying to get control of the system kernel

624
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,200
and that we'll know more in 15 minutes.

625
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,900
If we do stop the meltdown,

626
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,270
he wants to know

627
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,930
if there's going to be any system contamination.

628
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,330
Uh, no, there won't be any contamination.

629
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,670
It'll take 36 hours to reboot the reactors.

630
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,970
Is there anything else?

631
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,500
No, that's all.

632
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,030
All right, go.

633
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,670
We had security cameras running on only two areas of the event.

634
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,430
One was covering the main ballroom

635
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,400
and one was at the entrance.

636
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,200
Okay, put them both up.

637
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,330
The ballroom angle is too wide.

638
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
Let's just go with the entrance.

639
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,230
What time is that?

640
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,900
6:39.

641
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,970
No, that's too early.

642
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,230
I met him when I arrived,

643
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,970
around 9:00, 9:15.

644
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,130
Wait, stop.

645
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,600
Can you back this up a few frames?

646
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,670
Sure.

647
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,870
Wait, wait, wait. Stop there.

648
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,800
I think that's him.

649
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,170
Can you enhance him right here? Yeah.

650
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,030
That image won't process.

651
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,630
We need to make it clearer.

652
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,330
Okay, let me see if I can get that for you.

653
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,500
Who's supposed to be at that desk?

654
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,670
Oh, that's Mitchell.

655
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,170
Probably went out

656
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,070
for another smoke.

657
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,130
The back gate's wide open.

658
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,130
No one's there.

659
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,130
Greg, do you copy?

660
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,830
Greg?

661
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,430
Rick?

662
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,730
How many ways into this area of the building?

663
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,700
Two.

664
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,470
Put them up. Rick!

665
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,530
Get down. Get down!

666
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,400
- Are you okay?  - Yeah!

667
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,630
Damn it!

668
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,200
I'm going to look for help, okay? But first I need to know

669
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,230
about the surveillance tape Where's the source?

670
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,370
The main... ser... server...

671
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,470
How do I access it?

672
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,370
Put it on the... the... flash memory.

673
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,870
Okay.

674
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,700
Watch the security monitors.

675
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,130
Do you have sticks?

676
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,630
Gary, do you have sticks?

677
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,670
In my... in my... pocket.

678
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,030
Okay.

679
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,800
Stay with me.

680
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:44,830
He's gone.

681
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,000
Jack, they're coming.

682
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,100
They're trying to seal us off.

683
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,330
Shouldn't we call CTU?

684
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,900
No, CTU's got to be compromised.

685
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,930
That's the only way

686
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,270
they'd know we were here.

687
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,530
We've got to get out of here.

688
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,130
Move. Go, go!

689
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,530
Go.

690
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,330
Go, go.

691
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,730
There's one in the pipe.

692
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,570
- The safety's off.  - Jack...

693
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,530
You can do this. We'll cover each other.

694
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,670
I thought you said CTU's been compromised.

695
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,570
It has been.

696
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,700
Then who are you calling?

697
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,070
The only person I can trust right now.

698
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,470
If there are 17 nuclear power plants about to melt down,

699
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,340
I need to update an evacuation strategy.

700
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,540
I agree, sir.

701
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,040
I've already laid the groundwork

702
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,600
with the National Guard.

703
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,900
They're preparing to go into individual communities

704
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,540
and effect a civil defense evacuation upon your command.

705
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,540
You say our worst-case scenario gives us

706
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,870
approximately three hours.

707
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,540
That's correct, sir.

708
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,800
Erin, what are our chances of shutting down the remaining 17?

709
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:49,040
At this time, I would say it's less than 50%,

710
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,640
but we're trying something now

711
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,340
that might improve those chances.

712
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,540
When will you know more?

713
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
In the next 15 minutes.

714
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,370
Keep me updated.

715
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,570
Yes, Mr. President.

716
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,970
Let's find out from Jack and Audrey

717
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,170
if they've come up

718
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,900
- with anything on their end.  - Yes, sir.

719
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,600
Mr. Secretary, I can have a room prepared for you to rest, if you like.

720
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,900
You've been under a great deal of strain these past few hours.

721
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,770
No, I don't think I can rest, but thanks, anyway.

722
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,640
Erin?

723
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,340
Yes, sir?

724
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,270
I understand your daughter is down in the clinic.

725
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,640
Yes, but it won't interfere with my work.

726
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,840
I'm sure it won't.

727
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,670
I was just wondering if everything was okay.

728
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,900
It's something we've lived with since she was six years old.

729
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,000
There are good days and bad days.

730
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,070
Today's a bad one.

731
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,800
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,740
We're heading right.

733
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,800
Come on.

734
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,770
Come here.

735
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,600
Okay, we're going to get through this.

736
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,800
You've got to listen to me.

737
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,300
- I need to get that guy's weapon.  - Mm-hmm.

738
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,600
I need you to provide cover.

739
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,340
Save your ammunition. Space out your shots.

740
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,340
- You ready?  - Mm-hmm.

741
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,600
Okay.

742
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,470
Damn it.

743
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,740
Audrey, get down! I'm out!

744
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,400
Go!

745
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,940
- I'm empty.  - What?

746
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,870
I'm empty!

747
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,470
Jack!

748
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,340
Tony!

749
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,340
You okay?

750
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,840
Yeah! We're all right! Move! Move!

751
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,670
Edgar's just started the final sequence.

752
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,870
Is he in the kernel yet?

753
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,840
Yes. This is where he can't make a mistake.

754
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,700
If he does, he'll accelerate the meltdowns

755
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,900
instead of stopping them.

756
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,840
Sarah, look up the out codes

757
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,240
for Load "A" registered condition.

758
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,900
"FF-09"

759
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,670
No, that's a jump "A", I need a load "A."

760
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,800
Damn it, move.

761
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,600
That's it, "AB-A1." I think I got it.

762
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,970
What do you mean, you think? 

763
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,340
I'd like to go through it again before I send it, please.

764
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
How long will that take?

765
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,870
Ten minutes. We don't have time. You have to do it now.

766
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,170
Let me just check the headers.

767
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,540
Now, Edgar.

768
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,770
I did the best I could, sir. I hope it works.

769
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,970
So do I.

770
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,770
There's no response.

771
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,340
Come on.

772
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,740
There they go.

773
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,840
Congratulations, Edgar.

774
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,770
Oh, no, don't tell me that.

775
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,640
Edgar, what's going on?

776
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,700
Why are some of the reactors still not shutting down?

777
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:32,800
Edgar?

778
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,840
Edgar, talk to me.

779
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,700
Six of the reactors are immune to the kill sequence.

780
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:45,840
The Dobson override's already taken over their system.

781
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,700
Those six are going to melt down?

782
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,870
The shutdown codes have been completely corrupted.

783
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,970
Contact Bauer.

784
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,000
Either he finds the people responsible

785
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,170
for planning the override,

786
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,300
or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust.

787
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


788
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,080
You killed Tariq?

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,180
You can't let Father know.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,550
He wants me dead, because I messed up with Debbie.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,550
You were determined to kill him, to kill our own son.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,020
Nothing will stand in the way of what needs to be done.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,050
Not him, not you.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,650
Your father's following us.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,880
What?

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,780
It was the only way I could save you.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,850
Oh, God! Oh, God!

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,350
I think I got it.

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,150
This is really it. I can turn off the override

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,380
and stop the remaining plants from melting down.

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,450
Did the best I could, sir. I hope it works.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,220
So do I.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,750
Edgar, what's going on?

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,050
Why are some of the reactors still not shutting down?

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,350
Six of the reactors were immune to the kill sequence.

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,750
Contact Bauer. Either he finds the people responsible

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,920
for planning the override,

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,420
or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,020
Bauer and Audrey Raines left here about five minutes ago.

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,220
Where'd they go?

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,680
Falstead Security.

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,150
You're going to need to set things up on your end.

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,820
When Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,380
are killed, CTU is going to know that someone inside

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,780
leaked their location. Divert suspicion.

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,080
Fine.

30
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,180
The override device maintains heat levels

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,980
within the reactor. They can melt down

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,480
every one of those power plants.

33
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,720
The man you saw when you were being held captive,

34
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,380
right now he's our only lead.

35
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,080
Stop there. I think that's him.

36
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,480
They're trying to seal us off.

37
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,880
Well, shouldn't we call CTU?

38
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,420
No. CTU's gotta be compromised.

39
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,380
That's the only way they'd know we were here.

40
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,550
Then who are you calling?

41
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,380
The only person I can trust right now.

42
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,050
I'm empty.

43
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,250
Tony!

44
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Is there any chance this is a mistake?

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,180
For the remaining six nuclear reactors,

46
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,780
Arch is taking longer to shut down.

47
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,120
No. I can recheck it.

48
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,180
Those plants are firmly in the grip of the override,

49
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,480
which has been sealed off.

50
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,480
We can't get at it.

51
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,750
Did you send a list of the six affected cities to the President? 

52
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,020
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,620
What about evacuation procedures?

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,480
We've already alerted the National Guard.

55
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,580
We're just waiting to see

56
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,250
how the President wants us to proceed.

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,550
Miss Driscoll, President's ready.

58
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,080
Okay, put him on.

59
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,350
Mr. President.

60
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,720
I understand we've been able to shut down

61
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,080
98 nuclear power plants.

62
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,580
Yes, sir,

63
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,980
But as of now, it appears that our shut down order will not

64
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,920
be effective with the six remaining reactors.

65
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,550
Not going to be effective?

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,280
What exactly does that mean?

67
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm afraid it means that we could have

68
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,780
six nuclear disasters on our hands.

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,320
What are the casualty projections if all six plants...

70
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,680
melt down?

71
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,850
450,000 deaths in the first 24 hours.

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,620
The long-range estimate's in the low millions,

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,620
and that's not taking into account

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,980
the resulting cancers and birth defects.

75
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,880
Why were we able to shut down the other power plants,

76
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,580
but not these six?

77
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,780
It's because they're still

78
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,620
being controlled by the terrorists, sir.

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,080
You mean because of the override device

80
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,080
that they stole today?

81
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,380
Exactly.

82
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,950
We have to find the override device itself.

83
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,220
It's a prototype, and the terrorists

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,320
have the only one in the world.

85
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,350
All right, then let's find it.

86
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,580
I'm going to order the evacuation of those six cities.

87
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,420
Jim, keep me posted.

88
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,220
Yes, Mr. President.

89
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,050
All right, let's get back to work.

90
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,380
Yeah.

91
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,220
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack.

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Don't let anyone know

93
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,420
you're talking to me.

94
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,420
We got a problem.

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,650
I understand, Marcy.

96
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,150
Let me see what I can do.

97
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,720
I have to take this call.

98
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
Yes, sir.

99
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,620
What's going on?

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,650
First off, sir, I want you

101
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,950
to know that Audrey and I are safe, 

102
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,850
but there was an attempt made on our life at Falstead Security.

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,250
What?

104
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
A group of assassins, well armed, well trained, took out

105
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,980
our entire security detail.

106
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,750
You're gonna need to send a forensic unit over to identify the bodies,

107
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,380
but I don't want anyone at CTU to know.

108
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,680
Why not?

109
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,950
Because I think someone

110
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,020
over at CTU is complicit in the attack.

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,020
How do you know that?

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,280
Sir, CTU is the only agency that knew where we were.

113
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,180
No one else had that information.

114
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,050
Is one of Erin's people working with the terrorists?

115
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,220
Yes, I think so.

116
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,820
I just don't know who, but it's clear

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,150
that they didn't want Audrey

118
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,680
to make the I.D. of the man she saw

119
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,320
when you guys were both being held.

120
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,380
I'm sending a Secret Service detail to pick you two up.

121
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,480
Sir, please don't do that.

122
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,120
That's not the right thing to do here.

123
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,180
Why not? 

124
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,720
I don't want anyone to know where we are.

125
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,280
That way, I know we'll be safe.

126
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,620
How do you want me to handle this?

127
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,980
Remember the sequence we developed

128
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,120
for the Melbourne situation?

129
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,420
Yes.

130
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,420
Try that. I think it'll work.

131
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,750
Okay.

132
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,480
Sir, I've got to go. I'll get back to you

133
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,850
as soon as I know we're safe.

134
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,420
Jack, take care of Audrey.

135
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,380
Yes, sir, I will.

136
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,350
You okay?

137
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,520
I'm almost getting used to this.

138
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,920
Yeah.

139
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,150
Tony, is it possible

140
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,720
that we could have been followed?

141
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,250
No. We're clear.

142
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,980
Where are we going?

143
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,950
We need to lay low for a while.

144
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,450
What kind of communication do you need?

145
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
A wi-fi and a hard line.

146
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,280
All right, we'll go back to my place.

147
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,720
Okay.

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,950
Thank you, Tony.

149
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,980
Wait till you see it before you thank me.

150
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,850
No, I mean for picking us up, saving our lives.

151
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,720
I'm sure you're wondering what's going on.

152
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,020
Not really, no.

153
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,680
Something wrong?

154
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,750
What could be wrong?

155
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm not in the federal prison anymore,

156
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,420
thanks to you and President Palmer.

157
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,180
Michelle left me.

158
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,450
I...

159
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,680
You know what? Never mind.

160
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,880
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?

161
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,450
You heard about Audrey and her father this morning.

162
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,680
Yeah.

163
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,520
We were at Falstead Security so Audrey

164
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,980
could make an I.D. of a man she saw

165
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,120
during the kidnapping.

166
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,580
I don't get it. Why?

167
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,450
The secretary's kidnapping was just a cover.

168
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,820
The terrorists' main objective is to gain control

169
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,980
of American power plants from coast to coast.

170
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,980
The man that Audrey saw is our only lead.

171
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,150
I thought you weren't in the field anymore, Jack.

172
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,180
I'm not.

173
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,780
The secretary is my responsibility.

174
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,850
I got caught up in it.

175
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,580
Yeah, well, listen to me very carefully.

176
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,150
I don't want to get caught up in it.

177
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,120
So you do whatever you need to do at my place.

178
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm staying out of it, all right?

179
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,180
Understood.

180
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,180
Today continues to be a challenge to the strength of the American spirit.

181
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,180
We have a condition in six cities across the United States

182
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,880
in which nuclear power facilities may become unstable.

183
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,920
While we work to regain control over these facilities,

184
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,780
I am also asking our National Guard to assist

185
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,120
local authorities to affect an immediate evacuation

186
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,280
of those six cities.

187
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,080
This evacuation is only

188
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,220
being issued for all persons living or working...

189
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,880
The President didn't mention the fact

190
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,320
that there isn't enough time left

191
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,520
for a complete evacuation.

192
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,380
If those reactors melt down,

193
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,780
there are gonna be at least 50,000 dead per city.

194
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,220
We still have time to try and find a way to prevent that.

195
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,650
I can tell you now, Erin,

196
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,480
the chances of doing that from here are very low.

197
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,780
We have to find the people who have the override device.

198
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,080
What about the hospitals north of there?

199
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,780
All right. Keep checking.

200
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,780
Called Dina's sister.

201
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,980
There's no answer.

202
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,580
All right, I'll take care of it.

203
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,920
You and Rafi go check the station again.

204
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,780
Okay.

205
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,680
The Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors.

206
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,950
How many are under our control?

207
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,850
Six.

208
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,250
More than enough to break their will,

209
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,780
but I'm gonna have to manage the override personally,

210
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,780
make sure those six melt down on schedule.

211
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,180
Is there anything I can do?

212
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,580
Yes.

213
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,920
Take care of your mess.

214
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Don't worry, Madwan.

215
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,750
I give you my word.

216
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,650
My wife and son will be dead by the end of this day.

217
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,580
We have to get you to a hospital.

218
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,750
No. Your father knows I've been shot.

219
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,980
He'll be looking for us in all the hospitals.

220
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,150
Well, we're going to have to take a chance.

221
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,180
Mom, you're hurt.

222
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,520
I'll be okay.

223
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,880
You won't.

224
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,820
You need to get to a doctor.

225
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,650
I'm not afraid of Father.

226
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,850
You should be.

227
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,150
He tried to kill me,

228
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,650
and then he did this to you.

229
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,080
He is not my father anymore.

230
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,550
Mom, please.

231
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,650
All right.

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,150
Drop me off at an emergency room,

233
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,550
but then you have to drive away.

234
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,480
No. Whatever happens, we're staying together.

235
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,150
Jackie, I'm running a filter for Driscoll.

236
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,550
Could you baby-sit it for a sec?

237
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,720
- I'll be right back.  - Sure.

238
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,150
Yes, Marianne.

239
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,280
I couldn't take your call.

240
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,580
I was in a meeting.

241
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,080
Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are still alive.

242
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,750
My information was accurate.

243
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,480
Yes. The location was correct, but they survived the attack.

244
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,820
Are they headed back to CTU?

245
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,150
I haven't heard anything.

246
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,380
Bauer didn't call in?

247
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,250
Not that I'm aware of.

248
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,920
That doesn't make sense.

249
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,880
Actually, it makes perfect sense.

250
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,820
Bauer knows there's been a security breach,

251
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,620
and you can bet he's told someone here.

252
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,650
I gotta get out.

253
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
No, you are to stay in

254
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,750
until we take care of Bauer and the woman.

255
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,450
What about me? 

256
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,020
I am not gonna spend the rest of my life in jail.

257
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,750
You'll be taken care of.

258
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,520
You know that. Now go.

259
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,150
There you are.

260
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,480
What do you need?

261
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,480
Division is waiting for those projections.

262
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,880
Well, they're ready to be sent.

263
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,520
Well, then, send them.

264
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,480
Yeah.

265
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,180
Sir, your assistant, Scott Borman, just arrived.

266
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,750
- Should I send him in?  - Yeah.

267
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,520
Thanks.

268
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,350
Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you safe and sound, sir.

269
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,920
Thanks, Scott. Sit down.

270
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,750
Is there a problem, sir?

271
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,720
There's a big problem.

272
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,320
Someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside.

273
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,650
What do you need me to do?

274
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
I need you to go to Erin Driscoll.

275
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,250
Tell her that Jack Bauer is no longer at Falstead Security,

276
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,550
that he's watching the surveillance videos

277
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,180
at an old CTU substation in Torrance.

278
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,420
Anything about when Jack will call in?

279
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,720
When they identify the man that Audrey saw.

280
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,120
I take it Jack and Audrey are nowhere near the CTU substation.

281
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,180
Right. I'm trying to flush out the mole.

282
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,680
Then you'll need me to put a DOD Comsat envelope around this place.

283
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,480
And if anyone sends out a communication

284
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,520
containing the information you planted, that's the spy.

285
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,250
Yes, sir.

286
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,920
Let's go.

287
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,360
Watch your step.

288
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,530
The dog next door likes our yard.

289
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,330
Well, here we are, home sweet home.

290
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,930
Just stay here.

291
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,430
Oh, God!

292
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,260
Who the hell are you?

293
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,630
Hey, Jack, it's okay.

294
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,760
This is my friend Jen.

295
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,760
Tell him to play with his guns outside.

296
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,900
I'm sorry.

297
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,930
Excuse me.

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,630
I'm sorry.

299
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,000
What are you doing here, anyway?

300
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,800
I thought you were working.

301
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,100
I'm going in late.

302
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,100
This is Jack.

303
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
and his friend Audrey.

304
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,300
This is Jen.

305
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,630
Hi.

306
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,060
I... I saw you on TV today.

307
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,930
You're the daughter of the Secretary of Defense.

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,660
You and your old man were kidnapped this morning.

309
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,260
Yeah.

310
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,630
What's going on?

311
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,460
I'm helping them out with something.

312
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,500
Could you be a little more specific?

313
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,300
We need to use Tony's computer.

314
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,230
What, they don't have computers where you work?

315
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,760
Listen, babe,

316
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,860
We have a situation here, all right?

317
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,930
They need to lie low for a little bit.

318
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,560
We can't let anybody know they're here, all right?

319
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,160
Whatever. I'm leaving anyway.

320
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,760
Tony...

321
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,800
Jen, you can't go anywhere.

322
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,730
Why not?

323
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,330
We can't leave until Jack and Audrey take off.

324
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,430
We can't take a chance.

325
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,100
What kind of chance? I work at a bar.

326
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,900
I'm sorry, Jen. We're not gonna be long.

327
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,300
Look, stay as long as you want.

328
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,300
I have a job. He doesn't.

329
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,600
Jen, can I talk to you for a second?

330
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
Please?

331
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,760
Sorry.

332
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,730
No, she seems real sweet.

333
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,360
Look, we were fighting for our lives a few minutes ago,

334
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,730
and if it hadn't been for Tony, we would have been dead.

335
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,030
Now, I've been through a lot today,

336
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,730
and I'm sure when this is all over,

337
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,030
your boss will understand.

338
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
And if he doesn't?

339
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,860
I can have him killed.

340
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,830
Knock yourself out.

341
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,360
Thank you.

342
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,760
How are you guys making out with that?

343
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,260
Good. I just have convert this so I can read it.

344
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,660
And then, hopefully,

345
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,900
you can make an I.D. from the surveillance video.

346
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,360
I have some software for that. Let me dig it out.

347
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,360
Thanks.

348
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,360
You told me about Tony,

349
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,630
but I didn't know that Michelle left him.

350
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,260
Yeah, a few months after he got out of prison.

351
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,830
I thought he went to prison because of her.

352
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,160
He saved her life,

353
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,900
and she paid him back by leaving him?

354
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,330
That's the way Tony sees it, too.

355
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,030
Didn't happen exactly like that.

356
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,300
When Tony got out of prison, he was angry.

357
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,500
He couldn't get a job.

358
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,530
Personally, I don't think he wanted one.

359
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,200
He started drinking.

360
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,200
He pushed her away.

361
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,430
What is she doing now?

362
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,030
Deputy director over at Division.

363
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,900
I hope he can help us.

364
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,760
If he can, he will.

365
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,930
All right, here we go.

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,930
You got it, Tony?

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
Yeah, I got it right here.

368
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,460
Thanks.

369
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
We're in.

370
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,530
Start the ball rolling with Driscoll?

371
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,700
Yep. Headed into her briefing now.

372
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,700
She's not gonna be happy when she finds out

373
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,560
we're using her to flush out the mole.

374
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,900
I am surprised you felt the need

375
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,560
to keep her in the dark about this one.

376
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,460
As long as there's a leak in CTU,

377
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,800
we keep everyone in the dark.

378
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,400
Make sure that you're online

379
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,560
and that your databases are unlocked.

380
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,400
As soon as Jack sends in the image,

381
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,900
I need you to be able

382
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,030
to move as quickly as possible to make this I.D., okay?

383
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,360
I don't understand

384
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,530
why Jack's doing this at the old substation.

385
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,230
Well, apparently there's technical reasons.

386
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,630
I didn't speak with him directly.

387
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,660
Who did?

388
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,560
I did.

389
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,330
He also asked that his whereabouts

390
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,760
be kept strictly internal until he contacts us.

391
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,600
All right, let's go.

392
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,480
Old CTU substation in Torrance.

393
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,550
I remember this lady.

394
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,950
We saw him around here.

395
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,410
There he is.

396
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,050
You sure that's him?

397
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,250
Yes.

398
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,750
I'm gonna route this through the D.C. office.

399
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,210
Tony, she's on the phone.

400
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,250
We can't have her making calls.

401
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,010
We need the phone.

402
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,410
Go to hell. I can't go to work.

403
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,710
I can't talk on the phone?

404
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,050
Just give me the phone.

405
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,050
Go to hell!

406
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,250
Give me the damn phone!

407
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,010
Go ahead.

408
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,650
Thanks.

409
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,880
This is Marcie.

410
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,110
Marcie, it's Jack.

411
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,080
I'm sending you the image we need I.D.'d.

412
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,510
We're ready to receive.

413
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,750
Okay.

414
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,080
You positive this came from her system?

415
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,310
Yeah.

416
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,180
The voices were digitized and scrambled,

417
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,510
but we were able to clean it up enough

418
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,910
to make out the words "CTU substation."

419
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Where's security?

420
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,010
They're on the way.

421
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,110
Thanks, Scott.

422
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,980
Yes, Mr. Secretary?

423
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,980
Erin, I'm sorry to report

424
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,150
there's been a breach in CTU.

425
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,580
What?

426
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,610
The information Scott gave you about Jack is false.

427
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,580
What do you mean false?

428
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,680
Jack and Audrey were ambushed at Falstead Security.

429
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,010
They survived the attack,

430
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,350
but it's clear that someone in this office gave them up.

431
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,780
With all due respect, sir,

432
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,210
you knew about this and you didn't tell me?

433
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,050
Being left out of the loop is not something you should be concerned about.

434
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,410
I assume you're telling me now

435
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
because your sting operation yielded a result.

436
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,910
Yes, it did. Read that.

437
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,950
Where is she?

438
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,010
She's being taken into custody.

439
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,150
Join me.

440
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,480
Miss Driscoll, what's going on?

441
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,150
Go with these men.

442
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,850
What for?

443
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,280
You're under arrest, Gavin.

444
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,350
You've been passing classified information.

445
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,280
What?

446
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,110
What are you talking about?

447
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,150
Take her to Holding.

448
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,210
Holding?

449
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Miss Driscoll, what are you doing?

450
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,480
Miss Driscoll, I haven't done anything.

451
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,210
Miss Driscoll, this is a mistake.

452
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,410
What is happening?

453
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,210
Can someone please tell me what is going on?

454
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,520
I didn't do anything, please!

455
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,710
Get back to work.

456
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,800
I don't care how you divide up her files.

457
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,470
I just want everything off her system and then sent to me.

458
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,440
And enter new pass codes.

459
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,950
We can't just do this on your authority.

460
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,650
Edgar...

461
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,320
It's okay.

462
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,120
But he works for DOD, not CTU.

463
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,550
Yeah, well, he's the one that found the mole, right?

464
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,150
And Heller wants him to have joint authority.

465
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,990
Finish up here and get back to station two.

466
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,690
The program we set up for the reactor is almost finished compiling.

467
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,420
- Can I see this?  - Sure.

468
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,790
What makes you so sure Sarah's the mole?

469
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,620
She was sending out encoded information about Jack Bauer.

470
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,620
I don't think she would compromise Bauer or the investigation.

471
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,490
That's how she was able to fool everybody, Edgar.

472
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,150
She's the last person you'd expect to do it.

473
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,590
All right, just get me those files.

474
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,420
It's right here.

475
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,650
2:22 p. m. Message sent: "Old CTU substation in Torrance. "

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,090
This doesn't seem weird to you that she

477
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,420
would leave it on her system like this?

478
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,420
She didn't just leave it; it was encrypted.

479
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,790
Yeah, with a Bainbridge algorithm.

480
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,720
Come on, it's so old school, it's like saying,

481
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,790
"Please decode me.”

482
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,350
Let's face it,

483
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,790
Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.

484
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,820
Please, Miss Driscoll...

485
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,990
I promise you, there's been some kind of mistake.

486
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,350
How could there be a mistake?

487
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,620
Your system was isolated...the message was sent from it while you were there.

488
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,990
Somebody set me up.

489
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,450
That's the only explanation I can think of.

490
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,450
Tell me how that's possible.

491
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,090
Someone backed into my system through a subnet, planted something.

492
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,550
That's the first thing we checked.

493
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,920
None of them were compromised.

494
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,290
Let's stop playing games.

495
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,620
Thousands of people's lives are at stake!

496
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,290
Where are the people who control the override?

497
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,650
I don't know. That's what I was working on.

498
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,150
Who did you send the message about Jack to?

499
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,150
I didn't.

500
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,590
Miss Driscoll...

501
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,890
I would never betray our country or endanger people's lives.

502
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,350
You know that.

503
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,650
Was it the same contact who coordinated the attempt

504
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,850
on Jack and Audrey's life at Falstead Security?

505
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,750
I don't know. It wasn't me.

506
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,420
I learned my lesson today with Sherrick,

507
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:09,150
and I am no longer going to err on the side of caution in these interrogations.

508
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,550
Do you get my meaning?

509
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,790
I don't know what to say.

510
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,390
Eric, no.

511
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,490
Please don't do this.

512
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,950
Eric... Miss Driscoll...

513
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,390
Please stop.

514
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,020
If you want it to stop,

515
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,090
you tell me where the Dobson override is and who has it.

516
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,620
I swear, I don't know anything.

517
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,650
Wait.

518
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,720
There's got to be an explanation for this.

519
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,220
You got to give me some time to think.

520
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,690
Talk to me, Sarah.

521
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,150
Talk to me.

522
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,390
Miss Driscoll...

523
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,350
I'm not a spy.

524
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,020
I'm not.

525
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,420
Please believe me.

526
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,120
Driscoll, please.

527
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,220
I'm concerned.

528
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,290
Do you think you can break her in time?

529
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,150
I can break her in time, if she's guilty.

530
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,550
According to Scott, there is no way that this could be a mistake.

531
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,990
I agree it's hard evidence,

532
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,750
but I've known Sarah for eight months, and she doesn't fit the profile.

533
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,890
How do you want to handle it?

534
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,920
I'll watch for a few more minutes,

535
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,650
then I'll go back in.

536
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,690
I'll brief Jack.

537
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,690
Eric, please...

538
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,950
Please.

539
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,690
Eric!

540
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,920
What are you doing?

541
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,290
Just checking the surveillance from later that night

542
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,590
to see who he's talking to.

543
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,590
Did you find anything?

544
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,250
No, not yet.

545
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,950
Anybody want a beer?

546
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,220
I could use one.

547
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,550
This is Bauer.

548
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,590
- We found our mole.  - Who is it?

549
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,350
Sarah Gavin, works in Comm.

550
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,620
Is she working alone?

551
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,690
As far as we know.

552
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,790
Okay, I'll call Marcie, tell her the CTU channels are open.

553
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,520
We'll start sharing data.

554
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,220
How's Audrey doing?

555
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,350
She's good, she's resting.

556
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,050
Sir, I think now would be a good time

557
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,820
to send someone to have her picked up.

558
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,250
We're at 21408 Kipling, North Hollywood.

559
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,150
What's there?

560
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,150
A friend.

561
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,090
I'll send the Secret Service.

562
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,190
Thank you, sir.

563
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:26,020
Your father's sending someone over to pick you up, take you back to CTU.

564
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,890
Okay.

565
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,750
Don't you think you've made me miss enough TV today, Jack?

566
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,150
Why didn't you ever call me?

567
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,490
For what?

568
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,590
I've been there.

569
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,090
I could help.

570
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,450
I'm considered a traitor to this country.

571
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,750
My wife left me.

572
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,220
So how are you gonna help me, huh, Jack?

573
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,250
Yeah.

574
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,250
Look...

575
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,790
I owed you for getting me out of prison.

576
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,190
But today, I repaid that debt.

577
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,950
And to tell you the truth,

578
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,590
all you do is remind me of a past I'm trying to forget.

579
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,850
So why don't you do me a favor.

580
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,120
Do what you need to do here, and let's leave it at that,

581
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,390
All right?

582
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,790
Yep.

583
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,100
So, how did this happen?

584
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,700
I was working in the yard

585
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,370
and... backed into a nail that sticks out of our gate.

586
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,100
Oh.

587
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,870
This looks like a gunshot wound.

588
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,670
I'm afraid it was nothing that exciting, Doctor.

589
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,630
It was my fault.

590
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,430
I was supposed to fix that gate last week.

591
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,670
All right, you're gonna need a tetanus shot,

592
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,600
then I'll stitch it up.

593
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,070
Thank you, Doctor.

594
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,070
I'll be right back.

595
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,070
Go watch him.

596
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,730
What's going on?

597
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
He said something to the nurse.

598
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,970
Did he make a phone call?

599
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,330
Not that I could see.

600
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,830
Did she?

601
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,230
No.

602
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,200
Good.

603
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,570
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if they called the police.

604
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,230
At least the police could protect us from Father.

605
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,730
It would be bad to go to jail for the rest of our lives.

606
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,300
That's what would happen.

607
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,600
So where are we going to go after we leave here?

608
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,200
If we can get out of the city

609
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,870
and stay somewhere for a couple of days,

610
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,830
I can arrange for us to get out of the country.

611
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,470
Yeah?

612
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,070
Jack, it's Marcie. We got a match.

613
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,470
Who is it?

614
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,730
Name is Henry Powell.

615
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
I posted everything on that secure site.

616
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,230
Hold on a second.

617
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,700
Okay, I got it.

618
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,330
He's a computer consultant.

619
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,280
He used to work for McLennen-Forster.

620
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,550
Wait a second, McLennen-Forster.

621
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,000
They're the defense contractors that designed the override devices controlling the power plants.

622
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,470
Yeah, well, he's not there anymore,

623
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,670
but he freelances for them,

624
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,200
and he's definitely still in L.A.

625
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,600
- How do you know that?  - Because he's trying to leave the city.

626
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,800
We just found out he scheduled a chopper to meet him in Van Nuys in 15 minutes.

627
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,470
I thought all air traffic had been grounded.

628
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,500
It is. He must have some well-connected friends.

629
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,830
He got a special clearance.

630
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,800
Son of a bitch. Where in Van Nuys?

631
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,200
The helipad at the Larchmont Building. 

632
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,170
Okay, I'm gonna want you to ground his flight but not until I get there.

633
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,700
I don't want him to see me coming.

634
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,870
Jack, they're here.

635
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,930
- Can you make it in time?  - I'm gonna try.

636
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,530
Audrey, get your things. We got to go.

637
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,870
- Agent Davis, Secret Service.  - Jack Bauer.

638
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,130
You're gonna take the secretary's daughter straight back to CTU.

639
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,470
- Those are our orders.  - Okay.

640
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,530
You got a car for me?

641
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,470
It's right over there.

642
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,500
Thank you.

643
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,500
Audrey, they're ready.

644
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,700
- This is Agent Davis. He's gonna take care of you.  - Okay.

645
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,430
Be careful.

646
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,000
I will. You, too.

647
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,070
- CTU, Patterson.  - This is Jack.

648
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,570
Let me speak to Erin Driscoll.

649
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,200
Jack, I just got the file on Henry Powell.

650
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm going through it now.

651
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,070
He's trying to leave the city.

652
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,630
I've got to get over to Van Nuys.

653
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,770
You want air backup?

654
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,500
No, I want to keep a low profile.

655
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,930
I don't want to spook him.

656
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,500
The soonest I can get you a ground package is 30 minutes.

657
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,670
That's gonna be too long.

658
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,970
When is his flight due to take off?

659
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,370
Less than 15 minutes.

660
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,970
What do you want to do, Jack?

661
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,330
He's most likely on his own.

662
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,230
I'm gonna have to try and handle this myself.

663
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,270
All right.

664
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,500
I'll send a team anyway.

665
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,700
I'll be in touch.

666
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,330
What are you gonna try and handle by yourself?

667
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,900
Don't worry about it. It's covered.

668
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,530
Jack, it'd be pretty stupid of me

669
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,070
to let you die right after I risked my life trying to save you.

670
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,830
Could you use my help?

671
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,800
Yeah.

672
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,700
All right, let's go.

673
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,270
- Curtis.  - Yeah, Edgar?

674
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,200
- Has Sarah confessed to anything yet?  - No.

675
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,700
What are they doing to her?

676
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,800
Don't worry about it.

677
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,400
Just get back to work, all right?

678
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Curtis? What did Edgar want?

679
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,300
Why do you care?

680
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Well, you should let him know we need his full attention...

681
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,790
Get back to your station.

682
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,930
What's that?

683
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,600
Just something to numb the arm so that I can close the wound.

684
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,370
Okay.

685
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,630
I really wish you'd let me admit you.

686
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,200
This wound is serious.

687
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,270
There's a chance of an infection here.

688
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,870
No, Doctor, please.

689
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,800
Do whatever you can, and we'll leave.

690
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,130
Behrooz,

691
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,430
Where are you going?

692
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,830
I'll be right back, Mom.

693
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,470
Dr. Travis,

694
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,530
you have a visitor in the main lobby.

695
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,400
Dr. Travis...

696
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,130
Mom, the police are here.'

697
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,300
- Did you call the police?  - This is a gunshot wound.

698
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,170
Then why are you acting so strangely?

699
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,840
Let's go.

700
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,070
I told you it wasn't.

701
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,930
You shouldn't leave...you need to be treated.

702
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:32,730
Wait!

703
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,330
Let's go!

704
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,330
Come on...Come on!

705
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,720
Marianne.

706
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,520
What is it, Edgar?

707
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,780
About an hour ago,

708
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,290
You asked me to bump up your security clearance.

709
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,750
I was a little busy with the override,

710
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,120
but I finally got it for you.

711
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,980
Great. Thank you.

712
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,580
What?

713
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,190
You'll need to pick a password.

714
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,920
I set up the screen on server five.

715
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,520
There you go.

716
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,380
You need to use the same password as the one that unlocks your system files.

717
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,750
Okay.

718
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,450
Edgar.

719
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,680
Why do you keep looking at me?

720
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,080
I don't keep looking at you.

721
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,250
Let's go outside.

722
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,780
I want to talk to you in private.

723
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,020
I don't want to talk to you in private.

724
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,290
I have a lot of work to do.

725
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,120
It is getting incredibly tedious, Edgar,

726
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,350
to have to remind you repeatedly

727
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,550
that I could step into Driscoll's office any moment and have you fired.

728
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,980
Curtis, I need to talk to you.

729
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,420
What is it?

730
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,850
I need you to walk with me to Driscoll's office.

731
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,190
Walk with you?

732
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,780
Please, Curtis.

733
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,050
Sorry to interrupt.

734
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,050
What is it?

735
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,320
You got the wrong person.

736
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,720
Sarah's not guilty of anything.

737
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,050
How do you know?

738
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,620
Because I just sneaked into Marianne's system.

739
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,150
She used Sarah's to communicate outside of CTU,

740
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,020
made it look like Sarah was the one.

741
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,680
That's not possible.

742
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,190
Sarah's workstation was isolated from the subnet.

743
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,520
She didn't use the subnet.

744
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,720
How'd she get through?

745
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,120
She used a plain old AC power line.

746
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,680
What?

747
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,320
That's the last place anybody would ever look.

748
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,520
Plus it has plenty of bandwidth

749
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,520
to carry the signal.

750
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,580
Where is she?

751
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,880
She's trying to leave the building.

752
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,550
Lock down the exits.

753
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,520
You're under arrest.

754
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,350
Examine the contents.

755
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,520
Impound the car. Strip it and search it.

756
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,780
I got her.

757
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,850
Mr. Powell?

758
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,880
Yeah, let's go.

759
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,020
Uh, sorry, sir, we can't.

760
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,020
What?

761
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,250
Uh, flight's been grounded.

762
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,050
No. McLennan-Forster has special ordinance.

763
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,250
The paperwork was sent.

764
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,580
I know, but the order was superseded.

765
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,080
By who?

766
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,320
Department of Defense.

767
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,620
You're going to fly me out of here.

768
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,820
Please, sir.

769
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,250
Now! Get in.

770
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,520
All right, where we going?

771
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,020
Just get us in the air and fly east.

772
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,190
There it is.

773
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,120
Do not take off!

774
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,550
Do not take off!

775
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,050
Get in the air.

776
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,850
- Go! Go!  - Hold on!

777
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,020
Shut it down!

778
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
Come on, go.

779
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,850
Drop the weapon now. Now!

780
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,850
Shut it down.

781
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,780
Get out of the helicopter now.

782
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,850
Move!

783
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,290
Get up!

784
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,190
Move!

785
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,190
Where do you take me?

786
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,680
Put your hands on the roof of the truck.

787
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,020
Some people I know, they'll pay you.

788
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,680
Shut up.

789
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,120
I got his cell phone.

790
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,850
Bring me the bag.

791
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,850
Put your hands behind your back.

792
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,620
Who are you guys?

793
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,520
Police? FBI?

794
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,320
Actually, I'm currently unemployed.

795
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,320
I'll make it worth your while.

796
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,720
Put him in the back.

797
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,290
Come on.

798
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,520
He's dead, Jack.

799
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:58,890
Damn it!

800
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


801
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,510
The San Gabriel Island reactor has just gone critical.

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,050
The core material is now airborne.

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,910
I thought we had more time. 

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,540
At this rem rate, the radiation will continue getting stronger

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,110
and will spill into the atmosphere

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,180
until the core has exhausted itself.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,810
Son, you've done everything you can.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,410
Now get the hell out of there.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,580
Evacuating won't make any difference, sir.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,050
We've already been exposed.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,880
Jack has got to find the override

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,980
before the rest of these reactors go critical.

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,080
I know about you and him

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,210
and I am not okay with it.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,210
Look, you and I aren't together anymore.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,280
I thought we were trying to work things out. 

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,680
Yeah, I tried.

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,110
But you kept putting it off.

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,540
What did you say to Paul?

20
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,250
That I'm filing for divorce.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,640
Somebody set me up.

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,780
Thousands of people's lives are at stake. 

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,580
Where are the people who control the override?

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,280
Talk to me, Sarah.

25
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,380
I'm not a spy.

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,950
Erin, Powell's dead.

27
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,180
He was hit by a sniper

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,710
as soon as we took him into custody.

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,840
Did you find out anything from him before he was killed?

30
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,950
No, but I managed to get the last ten calls he made off his cell phone.

31
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,580
He called two numbers repeatedly.

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,410
We traced one of them to Maryanne Taylor.

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,510
You're under arrest.

34
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,080
Don't move!

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,910
Drop the weapon!

36
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,880
Listen carefully, Behrooz.

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,680
Government agents found me.

38
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,880
I made a deal.

39
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,210
I don't understand.

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,640
You're going to be okay.

41
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,080
I'm going to help them stop your father.

42
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,440
You broke my heart.

43
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,880
If you kill me,

44
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,150
Mother will tell them everything.

45
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,950
If you don't believe me, look outside.

46
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,440
They're coming to pick me up.

47
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,210
Drop the gun!

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,840
You'll hit the boy!

49
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,740
Behrooz!

50
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,480
Mom!

51
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,210
That stairway leads to the basement.

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,310
He's got nowhere to go but down!

53
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,740
Set up a link with CTU. Now!

54
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,710
If you can't save my son,

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,510
I am happy to see

56
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,710
the reactors melt down.

57
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,410
Did you get that?

58
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,540
Driscoll.

59
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,510
Erin, it's Jack.

60
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,950
Araz is on the move.

61
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,350
We're getting ready to move into the hospital now.

62
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,010
Daddy, you're choking me.

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Jack, it's Jim.

64
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,580
Bring us up to speed.

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
We have a hostage situation

66
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,610
involving one of the men that was involved in

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,640
the terrorist attacks this morning.

68
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,380
I'm pulling up his I.D. now.

69
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,740
His name is Navi Araz.    

70
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,810
He was granted American citizenship five years ago.

71
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,410
Who's the hostage?

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,110
His 17-year-old son, Behrooz.

73
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,110
He broke ranks and now his father sees him as a liability.

74
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,980
Araz knows we have his wife in custody.

75
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,440
He's worried that if he kills the boy, 

76
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,950
she'll betray him by cooperating with us.

77
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,440
What does she say?

78
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,380
She's agreed to help us find the override

79
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,250
and stop the nuclear meltdowns, if we rescue her son.

80
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,110
So, the father will stall. 

81
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,150
Keep the kid alive until the reactors blow.

82
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,610
That's right, sir.

83
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,410
We've already lost one in California, Jack.

84
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,010
Can we trust this woman to help us?

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,680
I think right now she'll do everything she can

86
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,980
to protect her son.

87
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,810
Okay, Jack. Whatever you need, you've got.

88
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,980
Just get that kid.

89
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,980
Yes, sir.

90
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,110
Erin, I'm going to need

91
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,610
a thermal satellite scan of the building.

92
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,740
We're looking for two heat sources in close proximity,

93
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,150
in remote areas of the basement.

94
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,910
I'll call you back as soon as we have something.

95
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,980
Yep.

96
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,380
You're running out of time.

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,540
Save my son.

98
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,580
Bring her with us. We're gonna need her.

99
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,250
I said get on the floor!

100
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,250
You're not my son.

101
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,810
Why?

102
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,950
Because I don't want

103
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,180
to kill innocent people?

104
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,840
Because you're weak and you stand for nothing!

105
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,680
I always saw you as something more

106
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,210
And now...

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,680
I don't even recognize you.

108
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,510
Will that make it easier for you to kill me?

109
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,350
Navi?

110
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,350
Yes, it's me.

111
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,810
Did you find your son?

112
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,050
Yes.

113
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,350
Is he dead?

114
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,380
Not yet.

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,180
Is there a problem, Navi?

116
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,840
Government agents have arrested Dina

117
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,710
and surrounded the building that I'm in.

118
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,080
I need the boy for leverage,

119
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,640
but I'm not sure how much longer

120
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,710
I can hold them off.

121
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,510
Has Dina told them anything?

122
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,640
I don't think so.

123
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,980
And she won't,

124
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,180
as long as I don't kill the boy.

125
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,180
How much more time do you need

126
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,010
to melt down the remaining nuclear power plants?

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,210
One hour, maybe two.

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,380
Why?

129
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,780
Why so long?

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,180
The Americans have programmers  

131
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,680
trying to prevent the meltdown.

132
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,150
That means we have to manipulate each plant individually,

133
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,710
and that takes time.

134
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,010
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

135
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,480
I know you will.

136
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,510
Yeah

137
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,380
Jack, I think we found Araz and his son.

138
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,380
Where?

139
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,680
We have two thermal readings

140
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,780
in the north wing of the basement.

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,510
- What's there?  - Laundry room.

142
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,810
How many ways in?

143
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
Just one, but according to the blueprints,

144
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,350
there's a laundry chute.

145
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,350
Is it accessible?

146
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,540
From the third floor.

147
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,980
It looks big enough to get a man in.

148
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,010
Okay, we're on our way.

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,010
We got him.

150
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,380
- Where are they?  - Laundry room.

151
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
This is Bauer.

152
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,440
I need two teams to the north wing.

153
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,440
Set up a hard perimeter.

154
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,680
We're moving to the third floor.

155
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,580
I need a fast line

156
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,410
and a rappelling harness.

157
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,410
Got it.

158
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,950
Lee, get me Dina Araz.

159
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,380
We're putting her into play.

160
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,210
Where are the latest timing estimates 

161
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,210
on the remaining nuclear plants?

162
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Right here.

163
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,740
These are from 40 minutes ago.

164
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,910
They update every 15 minutes.

165
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm sorry, Miss Driscoll.

166
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,680
I've been little upset about my mother.

167
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,150
You have to put your emotions on hold a little longer, Edgar.

168
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,440
We're in the middle of a crisis.

169
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,810
My mother just died, Miss Driscoll.

170
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,950
I can't put that on hold.

171
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,610
I'm sorry; that was callous of me.

172
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,310
But I'm really depending on you now, Edgar.

173
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,740
Please come through for me.

174
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,880
I'll get you those figures as soon as we're done here.

175
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,880
Thank you.

176
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,510
All right,

177
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,780
bring me up to speed.

178
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,540
We're trying to hold off the meltdown process

179
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,810
on five nuclear power plants.

180
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,510
How's that going?

181
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,150
Our programmers are trying to fight off the override.

182
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,540
They can slow it down, but they won't be able to stop it.

183
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,840
Which means we still have to find the override.

184
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes.

185
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,250
Jack has a suspect cornered

186
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,710
at a local medical facility,

187
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,910
and we're fairly certain this man he's pursuing

188
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,950
is one of the key architects in today's events.

189
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,150
Can we take him alive?

190
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,280
Unknown.

191
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,310
What about Maryanne Taylor?

192
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,610
I sent Curtis to interrogate her.

193
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,050
I want to call my lawyer.

194
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,080
Really?

195
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,880
I do have rights.

196
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,280
Yeah?

197
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,750
Henry Powell had rights, too.

198
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,340
I don't know any Henry Powell.

199
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,610
The one who helped the terrorists obtain the override.

200
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,050
He's right here.

201
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,240
Want to say hello?

202
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,210
Bring him in.

203
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,680
You sick... sick bastard.

204
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,280
CTU didn't kill him.

205
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,650
Well, then who did?

206
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,140
The same people who planted the bomb under your car.

207
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,650
Whoever they are, they've caught up with you.

208
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,010
Even if we let you go, you'd be dead in 15 minutes.

209
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,540
Get him out of here.

210
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,750
Your only chance to survive is to tell us what you know.

211
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,650
I want a deal.

212
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,910
You get to live.

213
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,140
That's your deal.

214
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,650
All right.

215
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,140
Who did you and Powell work for?

216
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,540
I don't know.

217
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,310
I only dealt with him.

218
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,850
Why did he send you into CTU?

219
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,780
To cover his tracks in case he became a suspect.

220
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,180
And after Audrey Raines saw him at the warehouse,

221
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,210
it became necessary?

222
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,850
Yes.

223
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,410
Did Powell work directly for the terrorists,

224
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,440
or for someone else associated with the terrorists?

225
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,310
I told you I don't know.

226
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,510
I need names.

227
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,280
People who can get us to the override.

228
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,480
I don't have any names!

229
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,850
But I...I can get them for you.

230
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,950
How?

231
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,910
Powell kept a file on his computer

232
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,540
at his office downtown.

233
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,240
It was a... an insurance policy

234
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,680
in case either of us ever needed

235
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,950
a bargaining chip.

236
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,680
Give me the address and the access code.

237
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,240
It can't be accessed externally.

238
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,180
It requires a thumbprint identification...

239
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,580
either his or mine.

240
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,280
Since he's dead...

241
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,610
it'll have to be mine.

242
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,380
All right, you set?

243
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,380
Yeah.

244
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,680
We think we found them.

245
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,310
- Where?  - The basement, in the laundry room.

246
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,180
Our satellite picked up two thermal images.

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,280
Then Behrooz is still alive.

248
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,650
Yes.

249
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,480
I'm going to need you to distract your husband.

250
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,950
I'm going to take you down to the basement.

251
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,710
In one minute, we're going to have you call your husband.

252
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,180
- We need you to keep him on the line as long as possible.  - All right.

253
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,280
Let's go.

254
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,750
Okay.

255
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,980
You ready?

256
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,080
Ready.

257
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,410
Okay, keep going.

258
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,240
Six feet...

259
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,710
four feet...

260
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,850
three feet...

261
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,140
Stop.

262
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,750
All right, come here.

263
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,440
Okay, make the call.

264
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,480
Remember, keep him on as long as you can.

265
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,710
Yes?

266
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,750
It's Dina.

267
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,540
Where are you?

268
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,980
Still in the hospital.

269
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,480
What have you told them?

270
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,880
Nothing.

271
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,080
And I'll keep my mouth shut if you release our son.

272
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,610
You know I can't do that.

273
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,050
Then at least promise me you won't kill him.

274
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,910
Is he still alive?

275
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,340
Yes...

276
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,580
and he'll remain alive, as long as you remain silent.

277
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,580
I have a visual on the suspect.

278
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,950
The boy is still alive.

279
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,810
I'm ready to proceed.

280
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Go.

281
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,650
Slowly retract the rig.

282
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,140
I'm in position.

283
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,750
Don't... move.

284
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,410
Get up slowly.

285
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,950
Put your hands on your head!

286
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,310
Stay with her.

287
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,680
Put your hands on your...

288
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,410
Hostile's engaged!

289
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,240
I don't want to have to kill you, but I will.

290
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,180
Now get up... slowly.

291
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,050
Interlock your fingers.

292
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,440
It's okay, son.

293
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,650
Just put the gun down.

294
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,180
It's over.

295
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,880
It's over.

296
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,780
Drop the gun!

297
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,880
- Tony, don't shoot!  - Drop the gun!

298
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,110
Please, son, put the gun down.

299
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,650
Put your hands on your head.

300
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,680
Hands on your head!

301
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,380
Turn around.

302
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,180
Behrooz, are you all right?

303
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,210
I killed him! I did. I killed father!

304
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,610
Your son is safe.

305
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,750
He's alive. We did what you asked.

306
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,240
Now, where is the override device?

307
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,280
I don't know that, but I can give you an address

308
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,610
where much of the work behind today's attacks was done.

309
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,910
That's not the deal we made.

310
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,050
That's all I know.

311
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,910
I can only tell you what I know.

312
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
What's the address?

313
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,380
24878 Alvert Street.

314
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,850
What's there?

315
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,210
It was a drop-off.

316
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,050
The place we used to get our final assignment.

317
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,910
It was the last place I saw the men

318
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,010
who were going to take possession of the override.

319
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,240
When was that?

320
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,650
Yesterday.

321
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,010
Send in an advance team.

322
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,510
Tell them to set up a hard perimeter.

323
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,110
No one goes in there until we get there.

324
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,750
You got it. What about these two?

325
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,210
Until we know she's not lying, they come with us.

326
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,000
So this Maryanne Taylor claims

327
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,530
she has to access the file personally.

328
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes, she does.

329
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,230
And do you believe her?

330
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,030
I'm not sure.

331
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
The polygraph indicates that she's telling the truth.

332
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,930
But in my opinion,

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,100
she may be a sociopath.

334
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,860
Are you a psychologist?

335
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,500
No, but I have had dealings with her before.

336
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,630
Dealings that might affect your judgment?

337
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,660
No.

338
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,300
Well, we have to check it out.

339
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
The question is how.

340
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,600
I can spare an operative from the cyber unit

341
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,960
and a security team.

342
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,030
What do you think?

343
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,600
I think Curtis should go.

344
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,230
I need Curtis here.

345
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,100
The information in the computer file may be important.

346
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,700
Someone with experience needs to examine it firsthand.

347
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,530
I agree.

348
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,030
Send Curtis with a security team

349
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,530
and you'll have to figure out

350
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,400
how to do without him till he gets back.

351
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,600
Yes, sir.

352
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,730
I don't like this.

353
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,200
Either do I, but those are our orders.

354
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,500
Get it done and get back here as quickly as you can.

355
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,360
Okay.

356
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,630
You okay?

357
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,730
Anything you need?

358
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm fine.

359
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,300
You understand, Sarah, I had no choice.

360
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,300
You were identified as a threat to security

361
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,600
and I acted accordingly.

362
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,230
I would have hoped you had more faith in me.

363
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,260
Personally, I do.

364
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,160
But the evidence was brought to me

365
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,860
by the Secretary of Defense,

366
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,660
and I couldn't very well ignore it.

367
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,960
So what happens now?

368
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,400
You can go home and rest.

369
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,800
No one would blame you if you did.

370
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,800
But if you're up to it, I could use you on the floor.

371
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,560
The San Gabriel Island reactor went into meltdown

372
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,800
less than an hour ago.

373
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,560
The five remaining plants are critical.

374
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,260
I need my best people in play.

375
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,030
I'll go back to work.

376
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,560
Thank you, Sarah.

377
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,830
It shouldn't be too complicated.

378
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,930
Building security is light. I have a keycard

379
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
that'll get us into Powell's office.

380
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,330
How long is it going to take?

381
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,500
Five minutes to get up to his office,

382
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,500
another five to download the data.

383
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,830
We're looking at a 15-minute operation time? 

384
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,330
Approximately.

385
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,700
If I think you're stalling,

386
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,430
taking longer than you should,

387
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,960
I will take action.

388
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,630
You got that?

389
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,800
Raise your leg.

390
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,730
Don't make me do it for you.

391
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,700
Curtis, I'm not going to run.

392
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,430
Then you won't mind wearing it.

393
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,730
Can I put my foot down now?

394
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,260
Yes.

395
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,300
Look, I realize that after today,

396
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,830
you have a hard time trusting me,

397
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,360
but if we're going to pull this off, you're going to have to...

398
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,060
I don't have to do anything except retrieve the data

399
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,260
your boyfriend had and put you in jail for treason.

400
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,900
Is that what you really want?

401
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,530
Without a doubt.

402
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,930
Curtis...

403
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,100
Get your hand off me.

404
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,500
I spoke with Mike at the local D.O.D. office.

405
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,730
He wants to know who you want

406
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,560
to bring in to help manage with their load.

407
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,230
Things are too unstable

408
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,700
for me to leave here.

409
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,160
I have to keep my eye on tactical.

410
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,260
Well, I checked with their logs, 

411
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,700
and they're going to need someone pretty soon.

412
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,100
How are you holding up?

413
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,900
I can handle it, if that's what you mean.

414
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,730
Dad, it'll be fine.

415
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,230
Why don't you head over there, then?

416
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,730
I'll call you from there.

417
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,660
Sarah, you're back.

418
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,100
Yeah.

419
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,800
I heard some rumors about what they were doing...

420
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,960
I'll be all right.

421
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,500
Just bring me up to speed.

422
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,160
Sure.

423
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,400
We're still trying to find the override.

424
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,530
It's the only way we're going to stop

425
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,760
the remaining plants from melting down.

426
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,500
What have you gotten out of Maryanne so far?

427
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,830
She claims she has access to a computer

428
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,300
that has data on it about the override.

429
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,500
And which computer is this?

430
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,060
She's taking Curtis over to it now.

431
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,700
They let her out of the building?

432
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,060
Yeah. He's got a security team with him.

433
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,600
And we trust her because...?

434
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,930
She's trying to cut a deal. Curtis can take care about her. We need the mobilized technique to support Jack.

435
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,900
- Agent Bauer.  - Agent Salars.

436
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,900
Agent Almeida.

437
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,330
Did you set your perimeter yet?

438
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,730
Anything inside four blocks is not going anywhere.

439
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,030
Any activity?

440
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,860
Not that we've seen.

441
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,800
Okay, I want to keep this

442
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,660
as surgical as possible.

443
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,900
You, me, and Almeida will be the insertion team.

444
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,360
Your men will maintain backup.

445
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,200
You ready?

446
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,730
Yeah.

447
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,530
Go.

448
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,930
We're clear!

449
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,060
Dina must have been lying.

450
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,030
I don't think so.

451
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,460
She wants to save her son.

452
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,200
Well, then they must have cleared this place out.

453
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,700
Bring in a forensics team now.

454
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,630
I want this place

455
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,030
torn apart for fingerprints.

456
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,060
Yes, sir.

457
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,730
Tony.

458
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,230
What is it?

459
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,800
Go.

460
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,260
It's clear.

461
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,560
That's the train they attacked this morning.

462
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,960
So that's how the terrorists got ahold of the override.

463
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,430
Jack?

464
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,100
They planned the kidnapping here.

465
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,700
Yeah.

466
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,470
Edgar, the location Jack is searching

467
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,270
didn't show up on any agency watch list.

468
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,340
Yeah, well, I'm having a hell of a time here.

469
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,470
Why?

470
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,840
The building is owned by a company

471
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,310
that's owned by another company,

472
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,440
that's owned by an LLC.

473
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,140
Galaxy Financial?

474
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,140
I've heard that name before.

475
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,440
No, Hal, I want you to put that in a separate file.

476
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,410
We'll handle the kidnapping and the train bombing another day.

477
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,470
Right now, I only want got ahold of things that are pertinent

478
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,140
to helping us find the override device.

479
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,510
Okay, I'll have it up on the system when you get here. Okay, thanks.

480
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,310
Tony,look, I need to talk to you.

481
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,640
I'm sorry.

482
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,870
Just give me a minute.

483
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,870
Yeah.

484
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,570
Jack, this is Sarah from CTU.

485
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,970
Listen, I got something on that address you gave to Edgar.

486
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,970
What is it?

487
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,570
The ownership of the building is complicated,

488
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,870
but I recognize one of the shell corporations on the ladder.

489
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,870
Which one?

490
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,010
Galaxy Financial.

491
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,270
I never heard of it.

492
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,540
Neither did I until this afternoon.

493
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,770
When Paul Raines came in,

494
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,210
I was the one who ran his clearance.

495
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,740
Paul Raines? What does he have to do with the company?

496
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,940
He's a general partner in Galaxy Financial.

497
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,010
You're telling me that Audrey's husband owns the building

498
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,310
that was used by the terrorists to plan this morning's attacks?

499
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,210
According to this, yes.

500
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,110
Where's Audrey now?

501
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,570
She's on her way over to D.O.D.

502
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Patch her through to me.

503
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,370
Yeah.

504
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,670
Miss Raines, this is Sarah from CTU.

505
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,640
I've got Jack.

506
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,410
- Hold please.  - All right.

507
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,010
Jack, I've got Audrey on the line.

508
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,210
Audrey, it's me.

509
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,710
Hey, did you find anything at the address?

510
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,440
Yeah, the building was used by the terrorists

511
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,670
to plan this morning's attacks.

512
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,170
Jack, that's a great find.

513
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,310
Yeah, there's something else.

514
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,710
What?

515
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,310
The company that owns the building,

516
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,070
it's called Galaxy Financial Services.

517
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,410
Have you ever heard of them?

518
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,640
No. Should I have?

519
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,570
Your husband is the chief financial officer.

520
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,610
What?

521
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,710
I need to find Paul. I need to speak to him now.

522
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,040
Paul had nothing to do with the kidnapping.

523
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,970
Maybe, maybe not.

524
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,470
But his name is all over the paperwork for the building.

525
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,210
Because of his relationship to you and your father,

526
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,640
he's going to have to explain that.

527
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,910
Jack, I don't know where he is.

528
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,270
He left CTU without saying anything.

529
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,270
Can you reach him?

530
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,270
What? 

531
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,210
Yeah, I have his cell phone number.

532
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,370
Okay, I want you to call him.

533
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,670
I want you to keep it personal.

534
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,370
I don't want you to tell him what I know.

535
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,940
I just want you to tell me where he is.

536
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,470
Audrey, five power plants could still melt down.

537
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,810
If Paul has any information that can help us stop that

538
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,510
from happening, we have to follow through with it.

539
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,540
You know that.

540
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,240
All right.

541
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,710
Please get back to me as soon as you can.

542
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,970
Okay, I will.

543
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,970
Hello.

544
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,010
Hey... Paul, it's Audrey.

545
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,340
I wasn't expecting to hear from you.

546
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,840
I know, I was just...

547
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,870
Look, Paul, I...I didn't like the way we left things between us.

548
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
I didn't care for it much either.

549
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,940
Look, uh, I'm glad you called, but, uh,

550
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,940
I'm about to check out.

551
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,210
Where you going?

552
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,740
What difference does it make?

553
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:51,840
Look, Paul, I was thinking about what you said,

554
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,810
about how... we've got so much going on for us.

555
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,870
I thought you wanted a divorce.

556
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,940
Yeah, I thought so, too, but...

557
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,940
You know, Paul, today was the first time

558
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,840
that we've seen each other in months, and...

559
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,640
I don't know, maybe it took a while for it to sink in.

560
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,410
Maybe you're right.

561
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,940
Maybe there is something there.

562
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,140
Audrey, you know this is what I want, more than anything.

563
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,810
Then let me come over.

564
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,270
I don't want to have

565
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,240
the most important conversation of my life over the phone.

566
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,140
All right, I'm at the Westmore, Room 408.

567
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,570
All right, I'll be there soon.

568
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,010
I'll wait for you.

569
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,770
Okay, no one goes back down there

570
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,170
until the forensic team gets here.

571
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,940
When they do, I want the place torn apart.

572
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,570
I want fingerprints, trace DNA samples,

573
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,670
fiber samples, everything,

574
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,140
- you understand?  - I understand.

575
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,570
Okay.

576
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,110
Hey, I need to follow up the lead on my own.

577
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,470
I need you to do me a favor.

578
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,140
I need you to take Dina Araz and her son back to CTU

579
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,740
and head up the interrogation.

580
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,310
Wait a second, Jack.

581
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,370
They'll never let me step foot in CTU, even if I wanted to.

582
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,670
Tony, listen.

583
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,010
You're the only one I can trust to do this.

584
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,110
Over the last two hours, 

585
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,240
I watched my friend come back to life.

586
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,370
It's not that simple, Jack.

587
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,370
If I press hard enough,

588
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,610
I can get you reinstated.

589
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,510
But I need to know now, is that what you want?

590
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,410
I don't know.

591
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,640
Maybe I was wrong.

592
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,170
You saved the life of the daughter

593
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,040
of the Secretary of Defense who happens to be my boss.

594
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,310
You do know that, right?

595
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,810
Jack...

596
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,940
Thanks.

597
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,740
I'll do it.

598
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,770
Lee.

599
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,670
Agent Almeida will be driving your car.

600
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,610
Yeah.

601
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,810
All right, Jack. I spoke with Paul.

602
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,240
He's at the Westmore downtown,

603
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,240
Room 408. I'm heading over there now.

604
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,840
No, Audrey! You need to let us handle this.

605
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,770
We don't know Paul's connections to the attack yet.

606
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,870
He could be dangerous.

607
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,270
Jack, I don't think we have a choice.

608
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,610
He was on his way out the door.

609
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,840
I had to make something up just to keep him there.

610
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,370
Fine, I can get there instead.

611
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,140
Jack, I'm only a couple minutes away and he knows that.

612
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,740
He's not going to stick around if I don't show up.

613
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,540
Audrey, I know you're trying to help, 

614
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,410
but I don't feel comfortable with you going in that room alone.

615
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,410
Jack, it's the only thing that he won't suspect.

616
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,410
He's been wanting to talk

617
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,410
about the marriage all day long.

618
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,340
Look, I'll keep him there until you get there.

619
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,770
No, it's not an option.

620
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,540
Jack, just get there as soon as you can, please.

621
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,270
Audrey. Audrey!

622
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,240
Erin, I just got off the phone with Jack.

623
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,470
He wants me to approve

624
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,040
Tony Almeida's reinstatement.

625
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,830
Do you have a problem with that?

626
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,100
Considering what Almeida has done for us today,

627
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,770
I do not have a problem with that.

628
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,800
Good.

629
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,440
Sir, you said you spoke with Jack.

630
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,870
How long ago was that?

631
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,170
Ten, fifteen minutes ago. Why?

632
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,400
We have some new information I'd like to share with you.

633
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,070
We found a curious connection to the terrorists.

634
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,500
What kind of connection?

635
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,070
Paul Raines.

636
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,970
My daughter's husband?

637
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,800
One of his companies is listed 

638
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,200
as the owner of the building Jack just searched.

639
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,970
The building the terrorists planned the attack from today?

640
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,000
That's the one.

641
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,140
Has anybody gone to pick him up?

642
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,170
We have teams on the way to the hotel where he's staying,

643
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,140
but he was about to leave, and the only way

644
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,240
to keep him there was under a false pretense.

645
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,640
False pretense. What's that supposed to mean?

646
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,070
Jack called to tell us that Audrey's meeting Paul

647
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,170
in his room. Jack's on his way over there.

648
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,370
What?!

649
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,830
She's going to try and keep him there

650
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,470
until our backup teams can take over.

651
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,700
Unacceptable.

652
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,100
How could you let this happen?!

653
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,170
This wasn't my decision.

654
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,470
This was her choice.

655
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,830
Jack did everything he could to stop her.

656
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,570
When did you find out about this?

657
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,600
About five minutes ago.

658
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,570
That's when you should have told me.

659
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,900
Yeah.

660
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,200
Find out.

661
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,140
Tell me everything you know about Paul Raines.

662
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,340
Why?

663
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,870
What's his connection to all this?

664
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,140
How should I know?

665
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,800
Look, Curtis, I wish I knew

666
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,770
something that you could use.

667
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,470
Believe me, I'm quite clear

668
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,200
it's my only way out of this,

669
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,580
but I don't know any more

670
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,470
about Paul Raines than you do.

671
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,940
How much longer?

672
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,830
About five minutes out.

673
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,200
Raines's part in all this is being investigated as we speak.

674
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,240
If your name turns up linked to the kidnapping in any way...

675
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,770
It won't.

676
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,470
I am going to do everything I can

677
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,640
to find something in Powell's computer that will help you.

678
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,470
Maybe something about Paul Raines will be on there.

679
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,900
Yeah.

680
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,170
What's this I hear about you

681
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,570
going to see Paul by yourself?

682
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,170
It's the only way to keep him here.

683
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,140
If Paul was involved in our kidnapping...

684
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,070
Look, Paul would never hurt me.

685
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,300
There is strong evidence to suggest that he was involved,

686
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,770
which means he is dangerous.

687
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,440
Look, I don't believe he is.

688
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,200
You don't know what he is, Audrey.

689
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,040
I've lived with him for eight years.

690
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,040
I know him.

691
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,640
Yeah, I thought I knew him, too.

692
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,070
Audrey, I forbid you to do this.

693
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,570
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm already here.

694
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,300
Mr. Almeida.

695
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,370
That's right.

696
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,300
Erin Driscoll,

697
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,370
Director of CTU.

698
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,730
How are you?

699
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,700
Uh, this is Mrs. Araz and her son, Behrooz.

700
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,370
Mrs. Araz is in need of medical attention right away.

701
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,670
Have her taken care of and prepare them for interrogation.

702
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,400
We've told you everything we know.

703
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,570
We'll see.

704
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,100
You're going to need these?

705
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,670
Miss Driscoll,

706
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,500
I'm sure you're aware of my history here.

707
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,500
Not an issue.

708
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,070
Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller both vouch for you.

709
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,100
That's enough for me.

710
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,870
Thank you.

711
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,500
Uh, Jack thought it'd be a good idea

712
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,970
if I headed up the interrogation.

713
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,240
That makes sense.

714
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,640
You've had the chance to observe them firsthand.

715
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,340
If there's anything you need, let me know.

716
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,900
That man I was just talking to

717
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,040
is Tony Almeida.

718
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,800
I want you to keep an eye on him.

719
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,670
Let me know if he goes off protocol.

720
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm particularly interested in...

721
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,000
...in any communication

722
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,830
between him and Jack Bauer or Secretary Heller.

723
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,140
That's right.

724
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,870
I'm beginning to see how things work around here,

725
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,000
Miss Driscoll.

726
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,500
How do things work around here?

727
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,040
You can care less about me being

728
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,440
falsely accused and tortured.

729
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,600
You're beginning to feel squeezed out

730
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,830
and you need allies.

731
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,000
That's why you were so nice to me before.

732
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,800
We're facing a crisis today, Sarah,

733
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,270
and our first priority is to deal with it successfully.

734
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,440
Is that a problem for you?

735
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,270
Not at all,

736
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,000
but after what I went through today,

737
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,040
if you want my help, I need something, too.

738
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,730
And what's that?

739
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,970
I want my arrest expunged.

740
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,870
Not explained by an official letter

741
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,400
in my file-expunged,

742
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,140
and I want a promotion, two pay grades.

743
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,240
Done.

744
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,900
Come on in.

745
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,470
I'm glad you came.

746
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,600
Can I get you something?

747
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,830
Sure.

748
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,240
I had them send up your favorite champagne.

749
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,640
To tell you the truth, I, uh...

750
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,570
wasn't sure you'd really come.

751
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,070
Why wouldn't I?

752
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,940
You were so adamant before about ending things.

753
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,040
Your turnaround was just

754
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,870
a little surprising, that's all.

755
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,500
How about you?

756
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,940
I hardly hear from you for about six months

757
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,500
and then you see me with another man

758
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,270
and suddenly you're pouring Don Perignon.

759
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,170
It shows what a fool I am for not realizing what I had.

760
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,340
It also shows

761
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,570
that I still have feelings for you,

762
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,370
and you must have some for me, too

763
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,570
otherwise you wouldn't be here, right?

764
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,170
I would hate to think

765
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,600
you are playing some kind of game with me.

766
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,270
I don't play games, Paul.

767
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,640
Okay.

768
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,570
To new beginnings?

769
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,830
New beginnings.

770
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,260
Miss Driscoll, it's Jack on line three.

771
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,960
Jack.

772
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,630
Are the backup teams at the Westmore yet?

773
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,260
No. They were caught up in traffic.

774
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,500
I'm still a couple miles out.

775
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
If your teams get there first,

776
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,900
tell them not to waste time

777
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,260
coordinating with hotel security.

778
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,200
I want them in that room as soon as possible.

779
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,130
Why not put some fiber optics in place first,

780
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,500
get a better position on Raines?

781
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,500
Because, if Paul's involved, he's gonna be nervous.

782
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,300
I don't want anything to possibly tip him off

783
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,830
Before we're ready to enter that room,

784
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,230
I don't want Audrey in any more danger

785
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
than she already is.

786
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,660
Okay, I'll pass that along to Tactical.

787
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,000
Has Curtis had a chance to question

788
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,130
Maryanne about Paul yet?

789
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,430
She says she doesn't know anything about him, 

790
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,160
but they're about to get into the computer files.

791
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,360
That might help us find the override.

792
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,960
Okay, thanks, Erin.

793
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,160
It's right down this hall and to the left.

794
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,000
Stay alert.

795
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,900
This place may not be as empty as it seems.

796
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,900
What, you think

797
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,060
this is some kind of trap?

798
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,630
Yes, I do.

799
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,830
Like you said, Curtis.

800
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,700
This is my only chance to stay alive.

801
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm not going to blow it, so relax.

802
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,500
Okay?

803
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,100
All clear, Curtis.

804
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,130
This will only take one minute.

805
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,630
Here it is.

806
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,000
All I have to do is reformat

807
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,930
and then we can download the data and get out of here.

808
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,830
Paul.

809
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,860
What?

810
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,760
The file has a second password encryption.

811
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,960
Do you know it?

812
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,530
I think so... but it's strange.

813
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,030
Take your hand away from the gun.

814
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,730
Take it away.

815
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,930
The files are still secure.

816
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,400
I... I didn't give them anything. I...

817
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,560
Now put the gun down.

818
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,360
Put it down.

819
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,100
Your name is Curtis Manning.

820
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,500
You work for CTU.

821
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,830
You're going to tell me

822
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,800
how far along you are in your investigation.

823
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,600
What investigation?

824
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,700
Of the override.

825
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,500
Have they discovered where it is yet?

826
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,860
You're an American

827
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,200
and you're working with the terrorists.

828
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,460
Who are you?

829
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm going to ask you one more time.

830
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,630
What does CTU know about the override?

831
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,660
Fine.

832
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,430
Or...

833
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,030
I could move to Washington.

834
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,060
I could turn West Coast operations

835
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,360
over to Ben Simon.

836
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,130
Audrey.

837
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,130
Yes, I... I heard you.

838
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,330
Turn West Coast operations over to Ben Simon.

839
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,700
What do you think?

840
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,460
I don't know. I... I guess you'd have to decide

841
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,060
whether or not you thought he was capable of running...

842
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,530
Not what do you think of Ben Simon.

843
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,360
Wh..What do you think of me moving back east?

844
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,430
Oh, um...

845
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,460
Well, I... I, I don't know.

846
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
I feel like I'm doing all the work here.

847
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,830
You said you wanted to talk.

848
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,100
You're not talking.

849
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,300
These things take time, Paul.

850
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,160
Well, maybe...

851
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,830
talking isn't what we should be doing.

852
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

853
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,730
You're my wife,

854
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,630
for God's sake.

855
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,100
You can't believe that I came over here to sleep with you.

856
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
Okay, you didn't come over here to sleep with me.

857
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,300
You didn't come over to talk with me. Why did you come?

858
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,400
I just... I thought that

859
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,530
maybe we could spend a little time together.

860
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,530
It would be nice.

861
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,200
On... on a day like this?

862
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,330
All hell's breaking loose.

863
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,560
You thought it would be nice

864
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,300
for us to spend some time together?

865
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,060
Well, I guess I really wasn't thinking when you called, was I?

866
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,130
What are you doing here?

867
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,160
What's really going on?

868
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,300
Are you spying on me?

869
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,100
Are you doing something worth spying on?

870
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,930
What is that supposed to mean?!

871
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,160
I just...

872
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,260
Maybe I should go.

873
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,560
I think you should stay!

874
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,760
- Please, just let me go.  - No!

875
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,600
No!

876
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,700
Let go of my cell phone.

877
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,830
Take your hands off of her!

878
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,930
You set me up!

879
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,560
Audrey, get behind me.

880
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,760
Put your hands on your head now!

881
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,360
Now!

882
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,560
What do you want?

883
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,460
I want answers.

884
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,830
Well, I'm not talking to you.

885
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


886
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,480
You're not my son.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:07,400
Why?

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,830
Because I don't want to kill innocent people?

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,890
Because you're weak.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,760
Government agents have arrested Dina and surrounded the building that I'm in.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,910
How much more time do you need to melt down the remaining nuclear power plants?

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,950
One hour, maybe two.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,030
I don't want to have to kill you, but I will.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,720
I have a suspect in custody.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,540
I need assistance.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,050
I need you to take Dina Araz and her son back to CTU and head up the interrogation.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,190
Wait a second, Jack.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,850
They're not going to let me set foot in CTU, even if I wanted to.

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,220
If I press hard enough

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,010
I can get you reinstated, but I need to know now: Is that what you want?

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,420
Ms. Driscoll, I'm sure you're aware of my history here.

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,150
Not an issue.

18
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,540
Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller both vouch for you.

19
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,380
That's enough for me.

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,750
Did Powell worked directly for the terrorists?

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,580
I told you, I don't know.

22
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,970
I need names, people who can get us to the override.

23
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,900
This place may not be as empty as it seems.

24
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,740
What, you think this is some kind of trap?

25
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,290
Yes. I do.

26
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,610
I didn't give him anything.

27
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,050
I...

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,200
What does CTU know about the override?

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,430
Audrey, it's me.

30
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,390
Hey, did you find anything at the address?

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,380
Yeah, the company that owns the building, it's called galaxy financial services.

32
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,200
Have you ever heard of them?

33
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,080
No, should I have?

34
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,580
Your husband's the chief financial officer.

35
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,580
What are you doing here?

36
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,670
What's really going on?

37
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,720
Are you spying on me?

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,550
Are you doing something worth spying on?

39
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,370
What is that supposed to mean?!

40
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,160
Take your hands off of her!

41
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,640
You set me up!

42
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,510
Put your hands on your head now!

43
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,280
What do you want?

44
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,730
I want some answers.

45
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,890
I think it would be better if you left the room while I question your husband.

46
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,330
You can wait just outside with the backup team.

47
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
What are you going to do to him?

48
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,050
Whatever I have to.

49
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,820
I'm staying.

50
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,670
Fine.

51
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,430
Look at me, Paul.

52
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,780
Look at me!

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,510
I've got nothing to say to you.

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,240
This is what you need to know, Paul.

55
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,890
There are five nuclear power plants ready to melt down.

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,870
All I care about right now is making sure that that doesn't happen.

57
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,300
Your name is on a lease in a building in Chatsworth

58
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,700
that was used by the terrorists to plan today's attack.

59
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,450
That makes you a prime suspect.

60
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,570
I'm going to treat you like one.

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,380
Do you understand that?

62
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,260
My name is on at least 50 different leases.

63
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,600
I own ten different corporations.

64
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,880
I don't know anything about some building in chatsworth.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,810
I don't believe you.

66
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,010
The lease of that building was notarized.

67
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,570
There's documentation of your ID.

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,320
CTU verified your signature.

69
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,000
Paul, you need to start talking to me now.

70
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,570
I've got nothing to say to you.

71
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,660
Jack.

72
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,170
I don't think that Paul would be a traitor to this country.

73
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,040
Right now Paul is a prime suspect,

74
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,240
and he's not cooperating with me and I don't have time to do this any other way.

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,530
I need to know for sure.

76
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,650
Paul...

77
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,060
this is the last chance you've got to talk to me before I have to hurt you.

78
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,840
Tell me about 24878 Alvert street in Chatsworth.

79
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,810
Why's your name on the lease?

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,450
Jack, please.

81
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,760
Audrey, don't interfere!

82
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,120
If you need to step outside of this room, do it.

83
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,290
Why is your name on the lease?

84
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,700
You're bluffing.

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,740
I need that information, Paul, I need it now.

86
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,170
Come on, Paul, just tell me.

87
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,510
What's your connection to the terrorists?

88
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,060
Jack?

89
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,880
Please, don't.

90
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,920
All right, all right, all right.

91
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,930
I... I... I don't know the specific building you're talking about.

92
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,410
I can find out.

93
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,050
How?!

94
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,740
My corporate records are stored on my laptop.

95
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,290
If that address is under my name then it'll come up.

96
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,580
Maybe there's someone else involved I don't know about.

97
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,300
What's your user ID login number?

98
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,250
It'll be much quicker if I just do it.

99
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,980
Please.

100
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,890
You want me to believe that you're not involved with this, Paul?

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,070
You better show me who is.

102
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,390
I'm sorry I had to call you here, Marwan, but I had no choice.

103
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,050
CTU is trying to disable the override, using a drinfeld module.

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,790
They've already shut down over 90 reactors.

105
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,900
We always knew they'd stop some of them.

106
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,470
The important thing is that one of the reactors has melted down.

107
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,620
As long as the override has control of the other five, I can do the rest from here.

108
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,020
Everything is ready for you upstairs.

109
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,400
Will anyone in that office be suspicious?

110
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,320
I've reported a system failure.

111
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,350
If anyone asks, tell them you're from it restoring my hard drive.

112
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,500
My desk is in the last row, three from the end, seat 86.

113
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,890
The override is well disguised inside the desk.

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,730
Here is the key.

115
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,720
Good.

116
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,790
How much time will you need?

117
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,950
45 minutes to melt down the remaining reactors.

118
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,220
I'm here if you need anything.

119
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,540
Where is the CTU agent?

120
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,880
Forbes is questioning him now.

121
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,440
He's out.

122
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,890
He's not going to tell us anything.

123
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,480
What does Marwan want us to do with him?

124
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,590
Finish him off.

125
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,260
Then get rid of the body.

126
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,320
Take care of it.

127
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,810
He came with a woman and two other agents.

128
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,900
Where are their bodies?

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,720
They're already in the van.

130
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,520
Yeah, here it is.

131
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,250
Galaxy financial services.

132
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,560
What kind of a company is it?

133
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,340
It's, um, a failing payroll service I was about to dissolve,

134
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,510
and someone came in with an offer to buy 51% of the shares.

135
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,160
Seven, or eight hundred grand, something like that.

136
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,640
Here... Harris Barnes, director.

137
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,590
Who is Harris Barnes?

138
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,530
I, uh... don't remember.

139
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,680
What do you mean you don't remember?

140
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,620
I'm involved with over 30 companies.

141
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,390
I don't deal directly with most of them.

142
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,660
Explain to me, Paul, how your name got on the lease.

143
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,360
I don't know.

144
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,200
You expect me to believe that you entered into a business deal

145
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,160
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars with someone that you'd never met?

146
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,140
Yes. My attorney handles most of the...

147
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,400
Paul, I don't believe you!

148
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,530
Jack, it's possible.

149
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,390
Paul has put together a lot of deals through his attorneys.

150
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,650
This is Sarah.

151
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,520
Hey, it's me.

152
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,210
I need you to run a name for me.

153
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,920
Go ahead.

154
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,030
Harris Barnes.

155
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,690
He's the director of a california corporation... galaxy financial services.

156
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,940
What am I looking for?

157
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,250
Where he lives, his businesses, anything that

158
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,410
could possibly connect with any terrorist activity.

159
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,980
All right, give me a minute.

160
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,080
I'll be here.

161
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,580
She's calling me right back.

162
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,880
Excuse me.

163
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,120
Oh, your boyfriend is just a thug with a badge.

164
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,620
Paul, why is your name on that lease?

165
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,430
Unbelievable.

166
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,470
An hour ago, I was sitting here feeling

167
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,670
sorry for myself that you didn't want me back.

168
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,250
And now... you think I'm a terrorist?

169
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,110
You think I had something to do with you and your father's kidnapping?

170
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,840
I don't know what to believe anymore.

171
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,650
Yeah?

172
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,420
Okay, I ran down the name Harris Barnes,

173
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,520
and a lot of data came up, but it was inconsistent.

174
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,080
So I went into the IRS records and found out that

175
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,380
Harris Barnes didn't appear on their logs until two years ago.

176
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,610
So it's an alias.

177
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,970
As far as I can tell it's a washed ID, with a valid

178
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,990
social security number and credit card history.

179
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,260
Interpol back traced a name and provided a list

180
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,200
of foreign nationals who've used it in the past.

181
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,540
Who used it most recently?

182
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,380
A man named Habib Marwan.

183
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,800
Okay, we need to find him.

184
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,190
I think we already have.

185
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,950
What do you mean?

186
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,580
Marwan used the name Harris Barnes to lease more office space here in L.A.

187
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,300
It turns out the same address was given to us an hour ago by Marianne Taylor.

188
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,150
She and Curtis are there now.

189
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,390
What's the address?

190
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,310
It's the 29th floor at the Rockland building downtown.

191
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,310
Okay, I'm on my way.

192
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,480
As soon as Curtis calls, you patch him through to me.

193
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,010
You got it.

194
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,730
You think Marwan's there?

195
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,810
Right now, it's our only lead.

196
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,980
If he is, that's where the override is.

197
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,380
I'll get back to you.

198
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,040
I want you to tell me who's still out there.

199
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,140
I want the name of anyone who can help us find

200
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,340
that override to stop the plants from melting down.

201
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,160
My husband kept all of this from me.

202
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,220
I only helped.

203
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,390
That's a bunch of crap.

204
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,160
Now, we know you were just as involved as your husband.

205
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,700
Listen, we're quite aware that the only reason

206
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,320
you're helping us is because of your son.

207
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,500
But believe me, it's not too late for us to change our minds about how we treat him.

208
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,820
There are a few men whose names I heard Navi mention.

209
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,370
They might know what you want.

210
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,650
But I don't know how to find them.

211
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,020
All right.

212
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,680
Why don't you start by writing the names down?

213
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,770
As far as we can tell, this Habib Marwan's been controlling the override.

214
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,700
Jack's on his way there now?

215
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,690
Yes.

216
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,980
Curtis and his team are already at that building.

217
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,730
I know, but we haven't been able to reach him or his team members.

218
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,050
He's not answering his cell.

219
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,210
How far is Jack?

220
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,530
About 15 minutes out.

221
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,860
Keep trying Curtis.

222
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,020
Tell him Jack's on the way.

223
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,640
We have to coordinate the two and find that override.

224
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,220
Okay.

225
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,620
Tony?

226
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,150
Ask her about a man named Habib Marwan.

227
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,970
Who's Habib Marwan?

228
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,690
I heard Navi speak of him a few times.

229
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,350
He's an engineer.

230
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,940
Beyond that, I don't know.

231
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,790
Ms. Driscoll?

232
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,630
Yes?

233
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,520
This is Alison Lackey at the clinic.

234
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,780
There's a problem with your daughter Maya.

235
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,140
I think you should get down here as soon as you can.

236
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,720
I'll be right there.

237
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,660
Thank you.

238
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,110
It's the CTU agent's phone.

239
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,980
What should we do?

240
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,130
Nothing.

241
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,180
Let them wonder where he is.

242
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,060
By the time they realize what's happened, it will be too late.

243
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,480
Find out if Adam and Jason have disposed of the body.

244
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,010
They should have been back by now.

245
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,730
All right.

246
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,120
Yeah?

247
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,610
Ali, Adam and Jason are dead.

248
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,430
Did the agent escape?

249
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,230
No, the door's still armed.

250
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,730
He's still on this floor.

251
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,340
- Find him.  - Yeah.

252
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,880
Yes.

253
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,960
The CTU agent is loose on this floor.

254
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,320
How did he escape?

255
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,720
He killed two of our men.

256
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,780
Does he know the override is in the building?

257
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,570
I don't think so, and he can't get to it.

258
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,010
We have the exits covered.

259
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,580
Disconnect all the hotlines.

260
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,380
He can't be allowed to contact CTU.

261
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,260
I will.

262
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:19,990
No, no, no.

263
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,550
You can't keep me here!

264
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,400
Maya, please.

265
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,080
We just want to help you feel better!

266
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,290
I'll feel better when you get out of my face!

267
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,860
Maya!

268
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,040
What took you so long?

269
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,760
I thought she was given a sedative.

270
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,220
We did.

271
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,140
She's fighting it.

272
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,440
Give me a few minutes with her.

273
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:34,990
Sure.

274
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,100
Nurse.

275
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,700
Honey.

276
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,840
Honey... I brought you here so that you could be near me.

277
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,710
Isn't that what you wanted?

278
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,550
I want for us to go home.

279
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,100
Maya, we will, honey, but we can't just yet, honey.

280
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,370
I don't like these people here.

281
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,030
Maya, Maya, that's not going to make you feel better.

282
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,930
You're wrong.

283
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,390
I do feel better.

284
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,070
- Sweetheart, I need you to...  - Go, get out!

285
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,000
You're such an important person, why don't you take care of your important business?

286
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,850
- Maya...  - Doctor?

287
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,590
Doctor?!

288
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,560
Doctor?

289
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,920
Yes, Maya?

290
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,930
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,900
I was misbehaving.

293
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,730
But I promise to be good.

294
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,520
If you'll just get that out of here.

295
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,360
I'm going.

296
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,970
I'm going.

297
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,700
Bye.

298
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,080
I'll be in my office if you need me.

299
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,540
Come on, Maya.

300
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,710
Curtis's phone is ringing, and he's not answering it?

301
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,170
Right.

302
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,560
It rang several times before I got his message.

303
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,180
If he had turned it off, it would have gone to voice mail immediately.

304
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,110
He's in trouble.

305
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,120
Where are the field teams?

306
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,120
Castle and his men will be there in two minutes.

307
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,190
I can have them set up a staging area along

308
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,930
the perimeter and stand by for your command.

309
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,520
What's the probability that Marwan's even in the facility?

310
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,360
We don't know yet.

311
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,290
Where are they staging?

312
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,400
They'll be waiting for you in a parking lot at the

313
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,450
northwest corner of Wilshire and Grand, one block away.

314
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,970
Okay.

315
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,540
Have your people found Marwan yet?

316
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,090
No.

317
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,770
Audrey, you, you have to know that I would never

318
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,040
be involved in anything that could bring you harm.

319
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,850
Of all the people this Marwan could approach to do business and he chose you?

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,370
It's a hell of a coincidence, Paul.

321
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,520
It might not just be a coincidence.

322
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,640
They might have wanted Paul for more than just the corporate shell.

323
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,920
He chose Paul because he was my husband?

324
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,540
That would put them one degree of separation from your father.

325
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,060
So this Marwan used me to get to Audrey's father.

326
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,540
It's a possibility.

327
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,880
Well, I had no idea where Audrey or her father would be today.

328
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,710
The information they used to stage the kidnapping couldn't have come from me.

329
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,420
They would have used your relationship with her father for something else.

330
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,660
Maybe to plan something for the future, a contingency plan.

331
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,610
I've been careless.

332
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,690
I'm so sorry.

333
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,190
All right, well, so far every name Dina's given

334
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,140
us has checked out as a mid-level cell member.

335
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,270
But what's interesting is that Marwan, who she claims to have never met,

336
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,110
is connected to everyone on this list.

337
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,340
It looks like all roads lead to him.

338
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,200
This must be his operation.

339
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,400
Which means she definitely knows more than she's telling us.

340
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,570
What do you want to do to make her talk?

341
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,000
I just need you to give me a little bit of rope.

342
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,110
Do it.

343
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,850
Why don't you tell me about Habib Marwan?

344
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,050
I already told you.

345
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,300
No, you told me you never met him.

346
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,990
I haven't.

347
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,700
Danny, could you come in here, please?

348
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,840
I'm going to need all video and audio monitoring in this room disconnected.

349
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,380
Thank you.

350
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,270
I'm not a stupid woman.

351
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,190
What are you trying to prove with this?

352
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,710
I'm not trying to prove anything.

353
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,040
I just don't want what I'm about to say to be recorded.

354
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,920
I don't believe you.

355
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,190
Open the door!

356
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,640
Everybody out.

357
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,940
Get out, now!

358
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,650
Everyone, Erin.

359
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,070
Unless you tell me the whole truth right now,

360
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,200
that deal you made to save your son is over!

361
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,240
And he goes to prison for murder and treason!

362
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,360
You can't do that.

363
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,470
The president signed an agreement.

364
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,400
If that deal gets in the way of protecting this country,

365
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,090
you think the president's gonna stand behind it?

366
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,290
He's gonna tear it up, and your son goes to prison for the rest of his life.

367
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,030
Let me tell you, I know a little something about prison.

368
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,080
And based on the conditions of his confinement, I can tell you right now,

369
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,580
I give Behrooz about three months before he commits suicide.

370
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,690
And by the way,

371
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,150
I'm going to make it my personal mission to make sure

372
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,860
you never hear word one about what happens to him, ever!

373
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,100
Wait.

374
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,950
Habib Marwan is the man our cell reported to in the United States.

375
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,390
You said "your cell" .

376
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,880
How many other cells reported to him?

377
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,040
I don't know.

378
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,270
But there are others?

379
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,460
Yes.

380
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,100
How many?

381
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,140
I told you, I don't know.

382
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,010
The cells are not in contact with one another.

383
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,610
Marwan thought it was safer that way.

384
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,470
What about the override?

385
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,490
Is it in his possession right now?

386
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,750
Definitely.

387
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,450
Definitely?

388
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,120
Why definitely?

389
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,380
Your programmers are trying to interfere with the meltdown sequence.

390
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,740
Marwan is the only one capable of stopping them.

391
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,280
And he's trying to do this by controlling it directly?

392
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,200
Exactly.

393
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,840
Where?

394
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,540
Where?!

395
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,500
Somewhere in downtown.

396
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,590
The rocklyn building?

397
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,620
Yes.

398
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,670
Sarah Gavin.

399
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,520
Sarah, get me Jack Bauer on the phone.

400
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,190
You got it.

401
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,260
Place her back in holding.

402
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,410
Erin, Dina just confirmed Marwan's got the override.

403
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,520
He's at the rocklyn building.

404
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,360
Everyone, listen up!

405
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,610
The address where Curtis is and where Jack Bauer is heading,

406
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,390
is the location of the override.

407
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,400
I want every station to focus on this location.

408
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,980
I want field teams ready.

409
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,250
Rework your assault tactics on the building factoring in this new information.

410
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,510
Let me speak to Tony.

411
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,600
Hold on a second.

412
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,270
Tony.

413
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,160
I've got Jack.

414
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,230
Jack.

415
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:31,950
Yeah?

416
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,790
We have confirmation: Habib Marwan is controlling the override.

417
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,880
He's at the address you're headed to.

418
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,760
What about Curtis?

419
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,930
No, we haven't been able to reach him yet.

420
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,460
Have you changed the assault profiles?

421
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,490
We're working on it.

422
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,900
Look, Marwan's the key to this.

423
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,160
He can't know we're coming or he'll take off with the override.

424
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,450
Also, we're running out of time.

425
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,670
We've got about 20 minutes before these plants start to melt down.

426
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,260
Okay, tell Castle to prep for a low-profile assault.

427
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,380
Tell him I'm on my way.

428
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,020
Copy that.

429
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,300
Get me Castle.

430
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,670
Ali?

431
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,570
Go.

432
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,400
Have you found him yet?

433
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,830
Marwan, it was not necessary for you to come down.

434
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,220
Not necessary?

435
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,070
We will find him.

436
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,380
If I'm captured, it'll end everything we've been working for.

437
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,350
We control the floor.

438
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,250
He can't get far.

439
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,710
Don't tell me what he can't do.

440
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,140
He's already killed two of our men.

441
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,100
What is it, Forbes?

442
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,700
Tell me you've got him.

443
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,010
No, I'm sorry, Marwan.

444
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,310
He may have gotten away.

445
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,840
How is that possible?

446
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,670
Ali says the floor is locked off.

447
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,100
I know.

448
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,200
We're still searching.

449
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,290
But we've got to deal with ventilation, air ducts, ceiling space...

450
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,110
I don't care how you get him, as long as he's contained.

451
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,670
I need 30 minutes.

452
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,840
Can you make that happen?

453
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,120
I can make it happen.

454
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,990
30 minutes.

455
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,240
Who's Marwan?

456
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,610
Who is he?

457
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,170
Does he have the override?

458
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,570
Does he have the override?

459
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,140
Yes.

460
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,650
Where is he?

461
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,230
Where is he?

462
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
One flight up.

463
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,690
I don't have access to the floor.

464
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,620
CTU Sarah Gavin.

465
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,820
Sarah, it's Curtis.

466
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,720
Where's Driscoll?

467
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,610
Where have you been?

468
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,590
We've been trying to reach you.

469
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,840
I'm still in the Rocklyn building.

470
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,560
Sarah, listen.

471
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,440
Maryanne's dead, I'm sure our backup teams are dead, too.

472
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,390
The override is here.

473
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,970
Uh, Jack's on his way to you now.

474
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,300
Jack?

475
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,190
I need you to put together a security detail for Paul and Audrey Raines now.

476
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:15,920
I'll take care of it.

477
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,290
I want you to stay here with these men until I get back.

478
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,030
Are you going in?

479
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,630
Yeah.

480
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
One second.

481
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,640
This is Bauer.

482
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,330
Jack, it's manning.

483
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,310
Where are you?

484
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,170
I'm still in the building... 29th floor.

485
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:30,990
Where are you?

486
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,980
I'm in the staging area about a block away.

487
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,800
Have you secured the override device?

488
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,650
No, but it's here, on an upper floor.

489
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,460
A man named Marwan is in control.

490
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,390
I know, CTU worked up a partial profile.

491
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,320
What's your mobility?

492
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:41,950
Limited.

493
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,610
They're still looking for me.

494
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,850
But I took an access card off one of the hostiles.

495
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,730
How do we meet?

496
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,230
Take the main elevator.

497
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,610
There's only one guard posted there.

498
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,710
I'll take care of him.

499
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,520
I'm on my way.

500
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,280
We've got Marwan boxed in.

501
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,590
I want you to send in your team, reinforce the perimeter.

502
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,870
I want men on the first floor in case this thing goes hot.

503
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,460
Got it.

504
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,660
I'll be right back.

505
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,300
Go, go!

506
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,450
That was our field agents from the Rocklyn building.

507
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,370
Your daughter's with them now.

508
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,010
She's safe.

509
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,890
I don't want her anywhere near harm's way.

510
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,770
She won't be, sir.

511
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,390
I understand we're closing in on the override?

512
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,830
We hope so, sir.

513
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,440
We believe we've found where the terrorists have it.

514
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,070
Which is where?

515
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,020
In an office building in L.A.

516
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,250
We believe the terrorists are either associated with one of the tenants,

517
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,890
or they've created a corporation they're hiding behind.

518
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,530
How is CTU proceeding?

519
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,820
We have teams converging.

520
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,900
Once we find the override, we have to use it to reprogram the reactors manually.

521
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,700
Will there be enough time to reprogram?

522
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,840
Our people will be ready, sir, once we find it.

523
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,610
All right.

524
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,410
I don't have to remind both of you of the consequences if we fail.

525
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,210
Everyone here understands what's at stake, sir.

526
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,470
Excuse me, Ms. Driscoll?

527
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,910
Dr. Sanford's on line two.

528
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,000
Excuse me, sir.

529
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,300
I'll meet you on the floor.

530
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,120
Yes, doctor?

531
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,490
I'm sorry to bother you, but Maya's acting out again.

532
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,680
What is she doing?

533
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,390
She's being abusive to my staff.

534
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,660
She's broken a few things.

535
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,040
If she doesn't settle down, I'm going to have to move her to a private hospital.

536
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,220
We're not equipped to handle a patient like Maya.

537
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,160
All right, don't do anything.

538
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,170
I'll be right there.

539
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,380
Sarah?

540
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:06,980
Excuse me.

541
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,660
Is Edgar still online with NRC?

542
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,220
Yes.

543
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,630
They found any alternate ways to stop the meltdowns?

544
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,080
Not without the override, no.

545
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,720
What's happening at the Rocklyn building?

546
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,120
Castle just called in.

547
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,900
His teams are spread out on the perimeter.

548
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,780
What about Curtis?

549
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,970
He's about to meet up with Jack inside the building.

550
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,370
Okay, where are you monitoring?

551
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,160
Station three.

552
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,500
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.

553
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,280
Make sure everything's ready and calm if Jack

554
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,790
and Curtis get their hands on the override.

555
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,220
OK.

556
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,450
You're a cruel person.

557
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,430
Do you know that?

558
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,380
Maya, please.

559
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,030
This is a restricted area.

560
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,400
You have to stay in your bed.

561
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,530
Stay in my bed?

562
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,620
What am I, a baby?

563
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,830
Maya!

564
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,770
What do you want, mother?

565
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,280
Don't.

566
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,930
Please, don't treat these people disrespectfully.

567
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,910
Please don't tell me what to do!

568
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,390
I'll stop telling you what to do when you stop behaving like a child.

569
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:00,950
What?

570
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,860
You heard me.

571
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,150
There are other people in this world besides you and they have problems, too.

572
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,950
Now, are you gonna get a grip on yourself

573
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,950
or am I going to have to call security and have them restrain you?

574
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,620
You're pathetic, you know that?

575
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,680
I will not allow you to talk to me like this.

576
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,340
I will not!

577
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,240
What are you going to do about it?

578
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,750
I...

579
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,320
I just want to get out of here, mommy.

580
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,190
And I will take you home,

581
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,440
but I have something I have to finish first.

582
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,510
- No...  - It's okay.

583
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,540
Are we clear?

584
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,600
Yeah.

585
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,060
Good.

586
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,810
That's my girl.

587
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,390
We've got a man down.

588
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,440
Take the wall.

589
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,540
You okay?

590
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,560
Yeah, I overheard a phone conversation between Marwan and one of his men.

591
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,790
We have less than 15 minutes.

592
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,790
How many are still alive?

593
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,060
I'm not sure. But at least four.

594
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,570
Have your men secure the floor.

595
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,080
Curtis and I are going after the override.

596
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,510
Which way?

597
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,100
This way.

598
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,160
What about backup?

599
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,660
No backup... we can't let Marwan know we're coming.

600
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,360
What's upstairs?

601
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,420
IDS data systems.

602
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,120
My guess is Marwan somehow inserted a sleeper into the company.

603
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,210
They must have used their servers to download

604
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,810
the virus into the nuclear power plants

605
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,390
by piggybacking on IDS hardware.

606
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:14,870
Yeah.

607
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,100
Take the door.

608
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,710
All right.

609
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,390
Clear.

610
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,740
Step away from the door, Ma'am.

611
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,430
I need you to exit the building.

612
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,080
It's an emergency.

613
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,420
You ready?

614
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:06,820
Yeah.

615
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,790
Let's go.

616
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,730
Did you get a description on him?

617
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,870
No.

618
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:27,810
It could be anyone.

619
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,810
Hey, Bob, what's going on?

620
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:34,780
Yes?

621
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,840
Marwan, it's Ali.

622
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,980
We've been discovered!

623
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,640
Ali?

624
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,510
Make sure all the exits are covered on all floors.

625
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,340
Roger that.

626
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,490
Last man down.

627
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,530
Curtis!

628
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,000
Stay down!

629
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,390
Stay down!

630
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,350
I got this exit!

631
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,450
You got him?

632
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,120
No!

633
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,940
Jack, I have the override!

634
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,160
Secure it!

635
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,720
Call CTU now!

636
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,710
Now!

637
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,350
I got him!

638
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,080
Driscoll.

639
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,240
Erin, it's Curtis.

640
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,180
I have the override.

641
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:10,790
Put Edgar on.

642
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,640
Edgar, line one.

643
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,440
It's Curtis.

644
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,280
He has the override.

645
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,240
This is Edgar Stiles.

646
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,320
Is the override logged in?

647
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:15,910
Yes.

648
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,120
Send it to channel 11.

649
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:19,670
I can't.

650
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,920
What do you mean you can't?

651
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,850
All the fields are write-protected.

652
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,890
It's not supposed to be.

653
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,600
If you're directly plugged into the override,

654
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,060
you should be able to do anything you want.

655
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,480
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's locked up.

656
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,320
What do you want me to do?

657
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,700
Ms. Driscoll, the clinic just called.

658
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,840
Tell them they're going to have to wait.

659
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,160
- They said it was an...  - Tell them!

660
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,940
Edgar, we're out of time.

661
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,350
If you're going to do something, do it now.

662
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,790
Marwan was the engineer on the project.

663
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,550
He must've modified the override to do this.

664
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,490
The NRC screen is showing the meltdown stage is already beginning.

665
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,850
Edgar, do something!

666
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,510
Curtis, there must be a hot key.

667
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,940
There's a lot of keys, Edgar.

668
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,420
I can't just try random combinations.

669
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,280
It'll take too long.

670
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,080
Press the function keys one at a time.

671
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,890
The status window on the bottom will light up when you get to an active one.

672
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,580
F5.

673
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,060
Good, hold it down and press "escape" .

674
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,010
Nothing.

675
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,410
Try F5, shift, Escape.

676
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,400
Okay, it's responding.

677
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,560
Good, set it to channel 11.

678
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,030
Hurry up.

679
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,580
Edgar, now they have three plants in meltdown initiation.

680
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,650
Did you get it?

681
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,390
I hope so.

682
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,830
It's starting to respond.

683
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,690
Yes!

684
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,680
The temperature is dropping on all remaining power plants.

685
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,240
Good work.

686
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,570
Congratulations, Edgar!

687
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,530
Great work, Erin.

688
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,950
Thank you, sir.

689
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,460
Excuse me.

690
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,920
Maya?

691
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,140
Where is she?

692
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:52,750
Maya?

693
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,460
Oh!

694
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,030
Oh!

695
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,070
Oh, baby...

696
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,720
Oh...

697
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,840
It's over, sir.

698
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,000
We've stopped the meltdown.

699
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,360
This is Bauer.

700
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,610
We got a man down.

701
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,600
Marwan is in the northwest stairwell headed to ground level.

702
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,970
Does anybody read me?

703
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,010
Jack, it's Castle. I'll get man up there.

704
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,210
All CTU agents: Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.

705
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,120
I repeat, the suspect is impersonating a CTU officer.

706
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,760
Solaris, do you read me?

707
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,600
Solaris, do you read me?!

708
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


709
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
There are five nuclear power plants ready to melt down.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,900
All I care about right now is making sure that that doesn't happen.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,900
Your name is on a lease in a building that was

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,800
used by the terrorists to plan today's attack.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,600
That makes you a prime suspect.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,400
I don't know anything about some building in Chatsworth.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
I don't believe you.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,100
Jack... please don't.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,900
I... I... I don't know the specific building you're talking about.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,900
I can find out.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,700
How?!

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,900
My corporate records are stored on my laptop.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,800
Yeah, here it is.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,800
Harris Barnes.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,530
Interpol back traced a name and provided a list

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,400
of foreign nationals who've used it in the past.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,900
Who used it most recently?

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,400
A man named Habib Marwan.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,700
Okay, we need to find him.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,900
I think we already have.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,300
You okay?

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
I overheard a phone conversation between Marwan and one of his men.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,600
We have less than 15 minutes.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,800
Have your men secure the floor.

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Curtis and I are going after the override.

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,600
Stay down!

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,100
I repeat, the suspect is impersonating a CTU officer.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,000
Edgar, line one.

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,500
It's Curtis.

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,300
He has the override.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Is the override logged in?

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,100
Yes.

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,000
Good.

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,700
Send it to channel 11. Hurry up.

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,700
It's starting to respond.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's working, Edgar.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Yes! Yes!

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,800
The temperature is dropping on all remaining power plants.

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,500
Ms. Driscoll?

41
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,800
It's about your daughter Maya.

42
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,500
You'd better get down to the clinic right away.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,300
Maya?

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
Oh!

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:12,900
Oh... oh... baby... oh... oh...

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,200
Curtis, I've got some new intel.

47
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,700
What is it?

48
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,800
We found out that the man you're looking for,

49
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,100
Habib Marwan, works for McLennen-Forster.

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
Look, they're the ones that made the override.

51
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,900
How's that possible?

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,900
He's working under the alias, Harris Barnes.

53
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,900
They had no reason to suspect him because his clearance has checked out.

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,500
He must have positioned himself inside the company so we can use their technology.

55
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,800
Call McLennen-Forster.

56
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
Tell them to freeze Marwan's personal files.

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,200
I did.

58
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,500
You want me to send the com team over?

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,300
No.

60
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,000
We're closer.

61
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,000
Jack and I will go.

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,100
Okay.

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Okay, we know Marwan was in the building within the last 15 minutes.

64
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,400
I want two tight perimeters set up here... roadblocks in every direction.

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,800
Yeah.

66
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,200
Okay.

67
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,000
Jack, I just got off with CTU.

68
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,020
Turns out this guy Marwan was working for

69
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,100
McLennen-Forster under the alias Harris Barnes.

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,600
I told CTU we'd check it out.

71
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,300
Okay, I'll check it out.

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,100
I want you to take paul and Audrey back to CTU.

73
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,500
I'll be reachable on my cell.

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
Cassell stays in charge here.

75
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,400
This guy's still in the area. Our teams will pick him up.

76
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,600
Curtis is gonna take you both back to CTU.

77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,500
What about you?

78
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,500
I have to go to McLennen-Forster.

79
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Why that?

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,400
Turns out the man we're looking for works there.

81
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,900
Need to get into their computer system?

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Yeah.

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Okay, I'll go with you.

84
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,900
Why?

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,600
My company sold them their IT system.

86
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,100
I used to be a systems analyst.

87
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,600
I designed their databases, encoded with military security.

88
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,400
Mclennen-Forster has personnel on board.

89
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
They're going to help us get into his files.

90
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Yeah, well, I can get you in backdoors those people don't even know about.

91
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,000
All right.

92
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,900
You go with me.

93
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,300
Audrey, I want you to stay with Curtis.

94
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,800
I'll be on my cell.

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,300
Let's go.

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Stop.

97
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,000
Goodbye, baby girl.

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,400
Okay.

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,900
I'll let everyone here know.

100
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,900
Yeah, thanks.

101
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,300
Let everyone know what?

102
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,700
Driscoll's daughter committed suicide in our clinic.

103
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,400
Committed suicide? How did she do that?

104
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,200
She slit her wrist.

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Doesn't make any sense. She was being watched.

106
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,200
I don't know, Edgar.

107
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,000
I wasn't there!

108
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,500
I was just thinking out loud. You don't have to be so hostile.(TBD)

109
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,300
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.

110
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Where's Driscoll?

111
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,300
The president is about to come on.

112
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,400
Something terrible just happened, sir.

113
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,100
What's that?

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,500
Ms. Driscoll's daughter Maya committed suicide in our clinic about 15 minutes ago.

115
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,800
Erin... Sarah just told me.

116
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,000
I am so sorry.

117
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,300
Thank you, sir.

118
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,600
Go back to the floor, Sarah.

119
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,700
Yes, Ma'am.

120
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,500
Erin, you do not need to be here.

121
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,100
Where should I be, sir?

122
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,700
We're still in crisis mode.

123
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,770
Habib Marwan is still out there and we have no idea

124
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,200
how many other cells he might be trying to activate.

125
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,070
For god's sake, Erin...

126
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,700
our systems are in a transition state that require my constant attention.

127
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm not in denial about my daughter's death, nor am I in shock.

128
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,000
I can perform my duties until you find a suitable replacement for me.

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,300
Secretary Heller, Ms. Driscoll, the president's coming on now.

130
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,900
Thank you.

131
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
Jim, Erin...

132
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,000
First I want to express my deep gratitude for what you've accomplished so far today.

133
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,800
Wrestling back control of the override has saved thousands of American lives.

134
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,070
The latest NRC report is that

135
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,100
the San Gabriel island meltdown is now under control.

136
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,200
That's great news, Mr. President.

137
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,000
But has your staff informed you that we still have a few problems to deal with?

138
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,900
Yes, and that's why I'm calling.

139
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,800
I understand the man responsible for today's attack is still at large.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Yes, sir, he is.

141
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,300
His name is Habib Marwan.

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,600
He's been a long-term employee of a major defense contractor.

143
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,300
Yes, I heard, McLennen-Forster.

144
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,700
This Habib Marwan...

145
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
do you believe that the melting down of the reactors was

146
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,300
his endgame or do you think he's planning something else?

147
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,500
As long as he's still out there, we have to assume it's not over.

148
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,500
Erin, exactly where are we on apprehending this man?

149
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,900
All our resources are being deployed to that end right now, Mr. President.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,700
I'll have more information in a few minutes once I've been briefed by my staff.

151
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
But we know Marwan's in los angeles, and we will find him.

152
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,590
Using the alias of Harris Barnes, Marwan worked at

153
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,500
McLennen-Forster for the last two years as a senior engineer.

154
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,100
His most recent project there was designing the development of the override.

155
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,200
Before that?

156
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,500
Well, here's the timeline we've pieced together.

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,900
He went to graduate school in england, then worked

158
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,000
for several years for a company outside of london.

159
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,900
But it's not clear whether he was radicalized there before that.

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,780
But the one thing we do know is that from the day he arrived in the U.S.,

161
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,000
everything he did was about today.

162
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,200
What were his other duties at McLennen-Forster?

163
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
We don't know yet.

164
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,300
We're taking a first pass at his records now.

165
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm looking into the possibility that he may have used

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,700
McLennen-Forster as a base to recruit his sleeper cells.

167
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,200
And that brings up another issue.

168
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,500
At present time, we have over 80% of field personnel looking for Marwan.

169
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,950
I'm just wondering if we shouldn't divert part of that

170
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,000
manpower trying to root out some of these other cells.

171
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,500
Erin?

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
I'm sorry, Tony. What was the question?

173
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Do you think we should reduce the field load on Marwan?

174
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,850
How about we take some of our people off Marwan

175
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,600
but still keep a floor of 60% looking for him?

176
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,900
Would that work?

177
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
Yes... that would work.

178
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,400
Okay.

179
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,300
Edgar, I want you to relocate personnel.

180
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Based on what?

181
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,200
Keep the people who've come in the last six hours working on Marwan.

182
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I want the most alert people focused on him.

183
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,800
Are we going to ignore what just happened here?

184
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,700
What do you mean?

185
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,200
She's talking about Erin Driscoll.

186
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
She can't focus.

187
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,700
She shouldn't be running this place.

188
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,500
Her daughter died a few minutes ago.

189
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Give her a little more time.

190
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,600
More time?

191
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,900
Edgar, since when do we have the luxury of time?

192
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,900
She's not stupid, Sally.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,100
She knows what's at stake here.

194
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,600
You're right, Sarah.

195
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,000
We don't have the luxury of time.

196
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,400
We have work to do. Now, work does not include deciding Erin driscoll's fate.

197
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,800
I think we have to tell Secretary Heller.

198
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,100
No, we don't. Not yet.

199
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
Now let's get back on it.

200
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,200
Hey, it's me.

201
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,000
Where are you?

202
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,700
Curtis and I just arrived at CTU.

203
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,020
Listen, I want you to get the security detail

204
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,800
and go back to the hotel and just get some rest.

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Jack, I can't leave.

206
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,400
Not now.

207
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,700
My father still needs my help.

208
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,100
Are you at McLennen-Forster yet?

209
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,900
Almost.

210
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,600
Jack, can you make me a promise?

211
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,300
What?

212
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,200
Take care of Paul.

213
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
He's not like you.

214
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,400
Please, Jack, promise me that you will look after him.

215
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,100
Yeah, I will.

216
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,800
Thank you.

217
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later.

218
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,600
All right, bye.

219
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
Look, uh...

220
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,600
I don't resent you.

221
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,060
Well, uh...

222
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,100
you didn't steal my wife... we were separated and it's fair...

223
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
but I'm not gonna let you take her from me.

224
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't think that's really up to you.

225
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,500
Or me.

226
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
No, maybe it isn't.

227
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,900
But... she... still has feelings for me.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,200
I can hear it in her voice.

229
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,200
And I'm gonna fight to keep those feelings alive.

230
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,900
Well, you're gonna have to do what you gotta do.

231
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,670
None of field agents at the Rocklyn building

232
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,800
have been able to pick up a threat on Marwan.

233
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,000
It's starting to look like he might've escaped.

234
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,450
So I think we have to assume that the first thing he's

235
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,800
going to try to do is activate some of these sleeper cells.

236
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,700
I agree.

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,010
He'll most likely launch a strike right

238
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,500
away, create fear that we're still vulnerable.

239
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,900
You'll have to excuse me, I'm not feeling very well.

240
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Erin.

241
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,100
Sit down.

242
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,900
You all right?

243
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,600
Get me medical up here right away.

244
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,200
Erin Driscoll needs assistance.

245
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,100
No, I'm fine. I don't need anybody.

246
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,300
I just... got a little light-headed for a second there.

247
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,400
No, I don't need you here.

248
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
It's all right. I was dizzy, but I... I feel better.

249
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,400
Well, take a break, get something to eat.

250
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,000
Take Ms. Driscoll down, and get her some food.

251
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,400
I can handle the situation here while you rest.

252
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,200
Come on.

253
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,300
All right.

254
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,000
That's probably a good idea.

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,200
She's going to need to be relieved of duty.

256
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,900
Contact division, alert them to the situation, and tell them to send someone.

257
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,900
I ran this office for two years.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,500
I could take over for Erin on a provisional basis.

259
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Forget for the moment that you technically don't even work here.

260
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,900
You've been away quite a while.

261
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,400
You're not fluent with the new systems.

262
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,800
With all due respect, sir, you don't need a programmer.

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,900
What you need a decision maker who knows how to stack up protocols.

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,900
And you can do that?

265
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,300
Yes, sir, I can.

266
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,600
Fine.

267
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,590
Effective immediately, you're the interim

268
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,900
director of CTU Los Angeles under my authority.

269
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,270
I still want to contact district, have

270
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,400
them send someone on a more permanent basis.

271
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,500
I understand, sir.

272
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,900
Sarah, do you have the abstract on McLennen-Forster yet?

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,800
One second.

274
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm finishing it now.

275
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,900
All right.

276
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,700
McLennen-forster was a principal contractor in the design of the override.

277
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,980
and Marwan... under the alias of Harris Barnes...

278
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,400
had full security access on that project.

279
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,400
And you ran FBI checks on the others that were involved in the project?

280
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes, they came up clean.

281
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,600
So we're dealing with a terrorist who had inside access to a defense contractor.

282
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,600
Actually, more than that, Curtis.

283
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,250
McLennen-Forster, in addition to being a weapons

284
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,000
manufacturer, trains their clients to use those weapons.

285
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,200
International clients?

286
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes.

287
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,200
Several countries in the Balkan, Asia and the middle east.

288
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,600
This is a messy situation.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,620
When Jack gets to McLennen-Forster, he's going to have to get into

290
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,200
those company records and find out exactly who Marwan dealt with.

291
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,900
It's not going to be that easy.

292
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,400
This reflects on the company.

293
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,840
They'll be reluctant to give up incriminating information...

294
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,800
even if Marwan were the only guilty party.

295
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Mr. McLennen, we need to talk seriously before CTU gets here.

296
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,700
What's the problem?

297
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,500
It was more than a coincidence that one of our products, the

298
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,700
override, was stolen and used in today's terrorist attack.

299
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,100
What do you mean, more than a coincidence?

300
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,900
The entire operation

301
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,700
everything from Secretary Heller's kidnapping to the meltdown

302
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,000
of San Gabriel island, was organized by one of our own employees.

303
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,100
What are you talking about?

304
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,800
One of our engineers

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,700
a man who we now know is a terrorist named Habib Marwan

306
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,600
was running his own covert organization from within our company.

307
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,600
When did you find this out?

308
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,400
A couple minutes ago.

309
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,380
They called and said that one of our employees,

310
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,900
Harris Barnes, was actually Habib Marwan.

311
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,600
Who else knows about this?

312
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,800
Just the two of us... and Conlin.

313
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,500
Gentlemen.

314
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
I'm David Conlin.

315
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,500
Vp of internal security.

316
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,400
Jack Bauer, with CTU.

317
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,200
This is Paul Raines.

318
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,800
Jack.

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,800
Paul.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,900
How can I help you?

321
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,400
I need to speak with your CEO, Gene McLennen.

322
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,500
Gene's in a meeting with a couple of directors right now.

323
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,800
He asked me to assist you.

324
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,500
I've access to everything in the building.

325
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,900
I'm sorry, but maybe my office didn't make itself clear.

326
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,600
This is a matter of national security.

327
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,500
I need to speak with Mr. McLennen now.

328
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
I understand.

329
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,200
Let me see what I can do.

330
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,000
What's the matter?

331
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
Something's not right.

332
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,600
John, I'm not going to keep this a secret.

333
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
We have to let the government know, right away.

334
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,100
Sir, if you do this...

335
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,800
it will, with 100% certainty, be the end of this company.

336
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Now you built McLennen-Forster from scratch.

337
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,700
Everything you have is tied up in it.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,670
If this comes out, your name will be synonymous

339
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,300
with what happened today... terrorism, treason.

340
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,100
Well, what do you want me to do, John, lie to the government?

341
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Look, if I knew 24 hours ago what I know now, I

342
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,500
would've done whatever it took to stop today's attack.

343
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,200
But there's nothing we can do now

344
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,800
except protect ourselves and keep this company from going

345
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,500
under, which it will do if CTU finds out the truth about Marwan.

346
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,100
John, CTU will subpoena the file.

347
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,600
They will find out the truth.

348
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,600
They won't, Gene.

349
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,800
I promise you.

350
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,600
Conlin and I can deal with this, if you let us.

351
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,100
I don't like the sound of this.

352
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,200
Mr. McLennen, we implicitly violated national security procedure.

353
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,700
This could mean prison time.

354
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,400
We've got to protect ourselves.

355
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,300
Did you get the latest casualty figures in san gabriel island?

356
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,200
No, not yet.

357
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,000
Which version of the datalink security system are you currently running?

358
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,400
Excuse me?

359
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,100
One of my companies produces... for datalink.

360
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,300
We installed your system.

361
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
You at 3.4 or 3.5?

362
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,700
Uh, 3.5

363
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,600
Will that work for you?

364
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Yeah.

365
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,000
Thanks.

366
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,000
Dave, come on in.

367
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,900
John Reese, Chief Technology Officer.

368
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,800
That's right. You helped us identify the override earlier. Jack Bauer.

369
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
It's good to meet you in person.

370
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,200
And I'm Gene McLennen.

371
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,400
I'm, uh, sorry I was delayed.

372
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,100
Thank you for your time, sir.

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,300
So how can I help CTU?

374
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,400
One of your employees, a Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan,

375
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,320
one of the terrorists responsible for today's

376
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,100
attack and the theft of the override device.

377
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,920
We need you to take your IT systems

378
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,100
off-line so Paul can look into his directory.

379
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,800
We can do that.

380
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,000
Can't we, John?

381
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Absolutely.

382
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,600
Follow me.

383
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,300
Thank you, sir.

384
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,100
Certainly.

385
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,730
Maybe you should go home.

386
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,520
I'm afraid to.

387
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,490
When my wife, Susan, died,

388
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,600
I didn't deal with it at all.

389
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,450
Actually, I went to work the next day.

390
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,380
I remember thinking to myself, "that's life. "

391
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,890
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

392
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,900
Get over it and get on with it.

393
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,960
A few weeks later, I answered a call from an old

394
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,810
friend of Susan's who did not know she had died.

395
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,870
And when I heard myself saying,

396
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,420
"Susan has passed away,"

397
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,480
when I actually said those words,

398
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,130
It hit me.

399
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,250
All the pain I was trying to shut out just overwhelmed me.

400
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,590
Erin, you can't keep it inside.

401
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,460
you cry, you blame god

402
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,090
you blame yourself, and then you cry some more.

403
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,250
And all the while, you let your friends help you.

404
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,380
It's pretty simple.

405
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,510
Very painful.

406
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,870
And I am so, so sorry for you.

407
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,120
Dad, I just want...

408
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,740
Oh, um, uh, uh, I'm sorry. I...

409
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,950
I... I just wanted to let you know that I was back.

410
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,550
I will go home.

411
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,490
You should go, and make sure your daughter's okay.

412
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,870
If you need me, I'll be on the floor.

413
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,230
Excuse me, sir?

414
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,980
Tony just told me you put him in charge of CTU?

415
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,120
That's correct.

416
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,450
That doesn't make any sense.

417
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,250
He just got reinstated, and I'm second-in-command.

418
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,850
Tony had Erin's job for two years.

419
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,650
He has experience running the CTU.

420
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,450
You don't.

421
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,500
- With all due respect...  - Relax, Curtis.

422
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,180
It's provisional, till district finds someone else.

423
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,930
For the record... I don't like it.

424
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,630
What do you hear from Bauer?

425
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,360
He just arrived at McLennen-Forster a few minutes ago.

426
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,660
He's gonna call on the com if he picks up interference there.

427
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,490
Okay, that was Marwan's work station in the corner.

428
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,440
His computer is tied into the engineering subnet.

429
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,510
What about the rest of the network?

430
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,430
Can you get into it from his account?

431
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,610
Yeah, I think there's a way to do that.

432
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,930
All right, you've got two windows.

433
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,460
One shows you his files in the system.

434
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,330
and the other will get you outside the subnet.

435
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,920
All right.

436
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,020
Let me know if you need anything.

437
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,820
Thanks for your help.

438
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,110
This guy looks like he knows his way around our system.

439
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,020
Don't worry. I'll be able to control things from here.

440
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,140
He won't find a thing.

441
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,890
Marwan purged a lot of files.

442
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,740
When?

443
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,820
Deletion dates aren't coming up.

444
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,990
That means they could have been deleted today.

445
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,930
Marwan wasn't here today.

446
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,160
He was in Rocklyn for the override.

447
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,420
Maybe someone else deleted the files.

448
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,360
There.

449
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,510
All right, let me see what I can find.

450
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,130
Yeah?

451
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,930
I had to open up a socket for him.

452
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,110
I can see it.

453
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,930
Are they gonna be able to find anything?

454
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,820
As long as I can see where he's looking and stay ahead of him

455
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,290
I should be able to delete the incriminating files.

456
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,550
All right. I'm coming up.

457
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,910
What if you can't stay ahead of him?

458
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,020
What happens then?

459
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,690
There are other options.

460
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,860
What other options?

461
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,860
We'll set off an EMP.

462
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,530
A pulse bomb?

463
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,650
Are you out of your mind?

464
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,400
You'll destroy every piece of hardware we have in this building.

465
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,250
It'll cripple us electronically.

466
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,360
That's the point.

467
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,210
This is the hand-over sequence for com.

468
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,310
I'll have the default password in place.

469
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,070
You can reset it as soon as you're done here.

470
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,810
All right.

471
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,340
Here are all the access codes to CTU and division.

472
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,310
Thanks.

473
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,590
Any of my personal stuff...

474
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,340
gets in your way, you just have someone box them and put them into storage.

475
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,070
If you need anything, ask Curtis.

476
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,320
And if he can't help you, you can always call me at home.

477
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,330
Thanks.

478
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,980
Could I have everybody's attention, please?

479
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,050
By now, you all know that I've taken over Erin

480
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,010
Driscoll's command on a purely provisional basis.

481
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,090
All protocols remain the same.

482
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,280
But I want updates from all department heads every 15 minutes.

483
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,530
Other than that

484
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,090
I'm just here to support you.

485
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,470
So, let's get back to work.

486
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,490
What do you hear from Jack?

487
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,920
He and Paul Raines are looking through Marwan's files now.

488
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,040
- Any promising leads?  - Nothing yet.

489
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,730
All right. Look, Edgar...

490
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,780
before Erin left,

491
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,450
she told me the one person I should rely on was you.

492
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,760
She said that?

493
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,230
Yes, she did.

494
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,880
So, if anything comes across your desk you think is important.

495
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,950
I want you to bring it to me directly, all right?

496
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,000
You got it.

497
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,430
All right, thanks.

498
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,610
Edgar?

499
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,710
Have you scanned all the satellite imagery around the Rocklyn building?

500
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,670
Yeah, everything's into take-down of the override.

501
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,730
All right.

502
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,040
I want you to try different frequency channels on that satellite.

503
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,500
Manually?

504
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,090
Yeah, that's the only way we can be sure to see it all.

505
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,670
You're going to have to talk to Tony about that.

506
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,360
I'm supposed to be backing up Jack and Paul at McLennen-Forster.

507
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,410
Put somebody else on that.

508
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,540
This is more important.

509
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,090
What's more important?

510
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,900
We've got 75% of our people on McLennen-Forster.

511
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,180
I need Edgar to help me find a trail to Marwan.

512
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,270
No, we don't have much of a chance of finding anything on Marwan by satellite.

513
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,380
Our best chance of picking up a thread is through those files at McLennen-Forster.

514
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,910
Stay on that.

515
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,160
We can't afford one security-grade analyst going over imagery?

516
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,590
Yeah, one. But not Edgar.

517
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,080
Put somebody else on it.

518
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,820
Tony?

519
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,800
Are we trying to accomplish the same thing here,

520
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,490
or is this about you establishing position?

521
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,240
I don't have to establish position.

522
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,730
I've already got it.

523
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,850
Now, what do you say we stop wasting time arm-wrestling here?

524
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,850
I respect your opinion.

525
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,250
But we're going to disagree from time to time,

526
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,830
and when we do, we're going to do it my way.

527
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,380
Fine.

528
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,590
But I suggest you put more manpower into a data search for Marwan.

529
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,630
All right, grab a couple of people from image processing.

530
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,780
Work the satellites with them.

531
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,660
Curtis?

532
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,260
Don't worry.

533
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm gonna be out of here when this crisis is over.

534
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,390
But in the meantime, I want the same thing you do.

535
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,440
I want to find Habib Marwan, all right?

536
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Is everything all right?

537
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,910
I heard you had a problem.

538
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,480
CTU got to the override before the other nuclear plants melted down.

539
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,560
Well, at least you're safe.

540
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,020
For now.

541
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,560
But they know who I am.

542
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,960
They'll be tracking me with everything they've got.

543
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,000
How does that affect our scheduling?

544
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,910
It doesn't.

545
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,360
Stay on task.

546
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,850
Make sure everything at the air force base is ready when I give the order.

547
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,210
I checked in with everyone as of ten minutes ago.

548
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,020
We're gonna make this thing happen, Habib.

549
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,240
Now, remember...

550
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,260
when you're done, get in touch with Prodo.

551
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,810
He'll get you out of the country.

552
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,580
And you?

553
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,270
Go.

554
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,900
Good.

555
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,380
What?

556
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,090
I can rebuild the files from these empty directories.

557
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,990
Damn it.

558
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,010
What's he doing?

559
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,040
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.

560
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,900
How can he do that?

561
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,900
I don't know.

562
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,460
It's not a documented function of this system.

563
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,620
He must be using some hook left into the design.

564
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,690
They're gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.

565
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,690
Not necessarily.

566
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,780
The pulse bomb...

567
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,950
We have to use it now.

568
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,680
Research six.

569
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,700
Set it off.

570
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,340
- Sir, there was no test scheduled today.  - This isn't a test.

571
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,140
Open up the safety chamber and set it off now.

572
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,780
Yes, sir.

573
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,670
We set off this EMP, CTU will know we're trying to hide something.

574
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,420
Well, not necessarily. Marwan's their suspect.

575
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,430
They'll assume he was behind it.

576
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,740
And what about the damage it'll do to threst of the infrastructure?

577
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,830
A lot better than destroying the entire company.

578
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,800
It'll take some time, but we can rebuild.

579
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:29,890
Yeah?

580
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,710
The EMP has been activated, sir.

581
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,770
And the shield door is open.

582
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,540
Okay, good.

583
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,110
It's been activated.

584
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,430
It will take ten minutes to charge up before its release.

585
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,050
Edgar?

586
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,710
What?

587
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,640
The phone TAPS you wanted at McLennen-Forster aren't holding.

588
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,500
What do you mean not holding?

589
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,900
The connection keeps drifting. I have to reset the patterns.

590
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,580
Is there a problem on our end?

591
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,900
Check their power supply. It could be their PBX.

592
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,510
Oh, my god. Look at this thing.

593
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,030
The amplitude's fluctuating like crazy.

594
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,910
I thought you checked that before you set the TAPS.

595
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,240
I did. It was fine then.

596
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,820
Let me call Jack.

597
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,330
That cellular customer is out of range.

598
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,940
Yes, I need to speak with Jack Bauer.

599
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,840
He's a CTU agent working in Parris Barnes office.

600
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,820
Hello?

601
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,430
Hello?

602
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,630
What's going on?

603
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,070
That's strange... all of a sudden the land lines around McLennen-Forster are out.

604
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,930
Can we use the network to message him?

605
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,860
Yeah, so far the computers haven't been affected.

606
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,380
All right, open up a window for me, would you?

607
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,890
what the hell's this?

608
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,800
I don't know.

609
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,100
Something's wrong.

610
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,510
I got to respond.

611
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,460
Can you pipe that window over to this computer?

612
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,720
Yeah, just give me an ethernet address.

613
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,640
6-e-f-f-3-2-3-9.

614
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,730
Almost got these files rebuilt.

615
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,260
Sarah, do we have any data points outside that building?

616
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,180
I'm on line with the phone company now.

617
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,630
They're getting complaints as far as eight

618
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,250
blocks away from the McLennen-Forster building.

619
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,780
- Have you still got a connection?  - Yeah, I got it. Look at this.

620
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,500
Son of a bitch. It's encrypted.

621
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,080
It's got to be it. Print it out, now.

622
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:22,700
Now!

623
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,260
Damn it.

624
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,840
They've got something.

625
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:31,930
What?

626
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,700
I can't read it... how much longer till this thing goes off?

627
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,090
Any second now, we should be fine.

628
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,700
We're not fine. He's printing it.

629
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,880
What are you going to do now?

630
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,960
Take care of it.

631
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,750
I don't believe this.

632
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,980
We're dealing with an EMP.

633
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,670
Mclennen-Forster were leading the way in

634
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,700
developing a nonlethal weapon for the military.

635
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,340
What is it?

636
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,480
An electromagnetic pulse bomb.

637
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,670
Once it goes off

638
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,940
everything within its radius that has electrical components gets fried.

639
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,920
Lights, cars, computers.

640
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,220
Every piece of electronic data just disappears.

641
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,330
Vanish forever.

642
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,540
Well, how long have we got?

643
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,500
I don't know.

644
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,430
Its capacitors are still charging.

645
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,990
Come on.

646
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,040
All right, the printer's warmed up.

647
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,340
Sarah, do we have any choppers in that area?

648
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,300
Yeah, one.

649
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,670
If that chopper's in the air when that EMP goes off it's going to

650
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,980
knock out its whole electrical system and that chopper's going down.

651
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,540
Get him out of the area now.

652
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,510
Edgar, where's this coming from?

653
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,610
From McLennen-Forster. I'm trying to get a position now.

654
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,130
CTU 3, do you hear me?

655
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,140
CTU 3, do you copy?

656
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,820
All right, this is coming through.

657
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,480
EMP is on first floor. Room 12.

658
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,900
Okay, they found the EMP. I'm going to try and stop it.

659
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,760
If I don't

660
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,830
I want you to take the hard copy, try and meet me in the front of the building.

661
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,700
Dave, Bauer ran out... he must have found out about the EMP.

662
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,290
Neil, CTU agent's heading down toward you. Don't let him anywhere near it.

663
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,410
Mr. Conlin...

664
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,760
Is everything all right?

665
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,630
As you can see, we're having some problems with the electricity.

666
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,050
Jack just went to check it out.

667
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,450
Saw you were printing something.

668
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,520
How'd you know that?

669
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,690
We were searching the system same time you were.

670
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,140
Trying to help you guys out.

671
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,860
Mind if I take a look?

672
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,560
Sure.

673
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,450
It's, uh, just in the printer.

674
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,180
Yeah?

675
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,590
Two's clear, I'm moving to three.

676
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,560
All right.

677
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,530
Oh, my god.

678
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:47,920
I've got to stop it.

679
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,350
You got nowhere to go, man.

680
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,580
Doors are locked.

681
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,920
Where's the printout?

682
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,040
Where is it?

683
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,820
Come on.

684
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,050
One of our choppers is down.

685
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,620
Send medical in now.

686
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,680
Call all field teams outside the perimeter of the blast.

687
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,870
We have to find Jack and Paul.

688
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,240
Sir, we have a problem.

689
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,660
Someone set off an EMP blast in the McLennen-Forster building.

690
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,200
We believe Jack and Paul are still inside.

691
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,350
I assume that's a response to our presence there.

692
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,180
Someone does not want us to get a hold of Marwan's file.

693
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,430
Jack was able to pull some information before the blast

694
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,990
but we don't know whether it was Marwan or somebody else that set it off.

695
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,820
Excuse me, sir,

696
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,560
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.

697
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,930
She just passed through security.

698
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,120
Thank you.

699
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,740
That was fast.

700
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,910
We got lucky.

701
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,040
Division had someone available with the

702
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,990
appropriate qualifications and CTU experience.

703
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,270
I understand.

704
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,960
Tony, I want to thank you for filling in,

705
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,730
and I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler.

706
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,500
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,450
Who?

708
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,860
Michele Dessler, do you know her?

709
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,170
I used to be married to her.

710
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


711
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,530
Here are all the access codes for CTU and Division.

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:16,960
Thanks.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,630
I'm probably gonna be gone a while.

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,130
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,460
Excuse me, sir.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,060
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,930
Tony, I want to thank you for filling in.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,720
I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:31,720
Who?

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,580
Michelle Dessler, do you know her?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,390
I used to be married to her.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,740
I have to go to McLennan-Forster.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,760
Why there?

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,200
It turns out the man we're looking for works there.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,100
Need to get into their computer system?

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,750
Yeah.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,400
Okay, I'll go with you.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,690
So how can I help CTU?

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,510
One of your employees, a Harris Barnes,

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,000
is actually Habib Marwan,

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,340
one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,120
and the theft of the override device.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,140
We need you to take your IT systems off-line

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,830
so Paul can look into his directory.

25
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,840
CTU will subpoena those files.

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,910
They will find out the truth.

27
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,700
Damn it.

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,930
What's he doing?

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,840
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.

30
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,990
Look at this.

31
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,770
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted. 

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,480
That's it... Print it out, now! Now!

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,750
He's going to find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.

34
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,310
The pulse bomb, we have to use it, now.

35
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,070
We're dealing with an EMP.

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,260
Once it goes off,

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,770
everything within its radius that has an electrical component gets fried.

38
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,880
I'm going to try and stop it. If I don't,

39
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,270
I want you to take the hard copy

40
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,750
and try to meet me in the front of the building.

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,280
A CTU agent is heading down near you.

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,340
Don't let him anywhere near it!

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,660
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,480
Are any electronic devices working?

45
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,300
Only the most basic battery-powered devices.

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,070
How many square miles were affected by the blackout?

47
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,850
Approximately 8, including the southeast quadrant of downtown.

48
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,990
- Okay, hold your position until the readings stabilize.  - Got it.

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,960
Any word from Jack or Paul?

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,690
No. Once the pulse bomb went off,

51
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,980
we lost all communication with them.

52
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,240
What was the last word we heard from them?

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,200
Well, Jack and Paul found something.

54
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,330
It seems it must have been incriminating to McLennan-Forster.

55
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,030
So that's why they set off the EMP, to destroy the evidence.

56
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,240
That'd be my guess.

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,300
That doesn't make sense.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,650
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking aggressive action

59
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,130
is evidence against them.

60
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,890
Yeah, but it's not proof.

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,970
Curtis, could Jack or Paul been injured from the detonation?

62
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,020
No, an EMP only damages electronics.

63
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,650
But it doesn't mean they're safe.

64
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,060
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.

65
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,850
Where is it?

66
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,440
It's up to you.

67
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,730
You decide when the pain stops.

68
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,430
Call me when he talks.

69
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,480
No.

70
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,260
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,290
I said drop it!

72
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,050
Paul?

73
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,950
Where's the data printout?

74
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,220
I hid it...

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,210
in an office down the hallway.

76
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,940
I know you're hurt,

77
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,190
but we've got to get it and get out of here. Let's go.

78
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,210
It's here.

79
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,180
Take a seat.

80
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,060
Where is it?

81
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,930
Bottom drawer, under some folders.

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,590
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.

83
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,460
Is this it?

84
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,630
Yeah, it's in code.

85
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,270
I couldn't make any sense out of it.

86
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,090
We need to get it back to CTU.

87
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,940
I don't think I could have held out much longer.

88
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,260
You did great.

89
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,210
Let's go.

90
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,600
For those of you who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.

91
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,290
She'll be taking over

92
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,380
as acting director of CTU, effective immediately.

93
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,530
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball

94
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,860
until Michelle got here.

95
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,660
Why don't you bring her and everyone else up to speed?

96
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,450
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,200
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man

98
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,340
responsible for planning today's attacks, Habib Marwan,

99
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,050
has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster,

100
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,840
the third largest defense contractor in the country.

101
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,280
Now we know that Marwan's been using the alias Harris Barnes.

102
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,520
What we don't know yet

103
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,550
is how he managed to evade their security checks.

104
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,520
Marwan knows we're looking for him, so he's probably gone dark.

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,480
But his association with McLennan-Forster

106
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,940
has become our primary focus.

107
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
Jack Bauer and Paul Raines went to the company

108
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,310
to inspect his computer files.

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,460
But as they were doing so,

110
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,780
an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated,

111
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,970
wiping out the company's entire database.

112
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,720
It also fried every electrical device

113
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,110
within an eight-mile radius.

114
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,540
Streetlights, computers, cars, cell phones, everything.

115
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,050
Were Jack and Paul able to find anything before detonation?

116
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,760
Yes, but we haven't been able to contact them since the blast.

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,260
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP

118
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
thinks Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated.

119
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,170
Have rescue teams been sent into the area?

120
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,570
Not yet. Once we've confirmed that the affects have subsided,

121
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,470
we'll send two teams in with fully-functional electronics.

122
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,650
The only problem is, until we find Jack and Paul,

123
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,030
they're not going to be able to do much.

124
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,100
We want to do everything we can

125
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,050
to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines.

126
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,590
But the priority is to retrieve any information

127
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,430
they found at McLennan-Forster.

128
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,670
That's all.

129
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,790
Tony?

130
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,780
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.

131
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,870
Thank you.

132
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,200
What do you want me to do?

133
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,170
Division is sending over a supplemental list

134
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,240
of terrorists that supposedly had contacts with Habib Marwan.

135
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,870
I want you to check any names

136
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,410
that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.

137
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,350
Given what's happening right now,

138
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,950
it doesn't seem like the best use of my time.

139
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,420
It has to be done.

140
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,040
And I'd like you to do it.

141
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,490
Michelle, Jack and Paul

142
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,960
have information that could be vital

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,970
in helping us end this crisis.

144
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,470
I should be helping us find them.

145
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,050
Michelle...

146
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,980
The last time I saw you,

147
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,530
you couldn't stay sober long enough to keep a job.

148
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,000
That was six months ago.

149
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,120
This is what I need you to do.

150
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,330
If you don't like it, you can resign.

151
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,010
I'm gonna need a security clearance.

152
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,520
I'll make sure you get a level three.

153
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,280
A level three?

154
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,360
I used to have a six.

155
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,190
Right now, all you need is three.

156
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,640
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?

157
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Not at all.

158
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,800
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflictson the job.

159
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,230
I know your history.

160
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,510
I know that you guys were married

161
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,600
and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.

162
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,640
But if this is going to be a problem...

163
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,340
His being here will not affect my work.

164
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,100
I won't let it.

165
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,310
Now, if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it,

166
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,830
I'll be more than glad to.

167
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,830
We are receiving preliminary reports from LAPD,

168
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,010
indicating that there is widespread looting going on

169
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,540
in the blacked out zone.

170
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,830
A number of cars have been set on fire,

171
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,200
stores have been ransacked, shots were heard.

172
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,650
There may even be casualties.

173
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,460
We just don't know at this time.

174
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,300
Shots were heard? That could be

175
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,560
the same people that are after Jack. I don't get it.

176
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,730
What information could Jack have found

177
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,250
that would be worth setting off a pulse bomb?

178
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,660
Something that implicates McLennan-Forster.

179
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,500
Anything they're doing now is insignificant

180
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
if there's proof that they helped Marwanwith today's attacks.

181
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,830
This is Anderson.

182
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,630
It is time for you to go.

183
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,270
Marwan, your face is all over the news.

184
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,980
Don't worry about it.

185
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,800
Things will proceed as planned.

186
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,750
Are you ready?

187
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,320
Yes, of course.

188
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,260
How long will it take you to get there?

189
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,090
Less than 30 minutes.

190
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,600
I'll inform the others.

191
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,770
The helicopter's heading to McLennan-Forster,

192
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,770
and it's not responding to any of our ID requests.

193
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,290
You sure?

194
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,020
Yeah, I'm positive.

195
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,470
Michelle.

196
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,540
Excuse me.

197
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,100
There's a chopper flying through the dead zone,

198
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,290
not one of ours.

199
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,950
Police?

200
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,100
No. Not one of theirs either, I checked.

201
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,900
- We picked it up by its electronic signature.  - Where's it going?

202
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,700
Straight to McLennan-Forster.

203
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,900
Could it be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?

204
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,900
- They'd give the police a call sign.  - It's a search-and-destroy mission.

205
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,660
A chopper that size carries 20 menfully armed.

206
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,080
Who would have sent it?

207
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,910
Whoever set off the EMP.

208
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,280
They're going in after Jack and Paul.

209
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,960
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.

210
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,430
Contact our field teams in the air.

211
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,120
Let them know about the intruding chopper.

212
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,550
Jack, I can't do this.

213
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,750
Don't have a choice. Come on.

214
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,550
Get me some gear!

215
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,230
These are the men we're looking for. They have an encoded computer print-out.

216
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,510
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.

217
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,110
Just be aware, one of them is a CTU field agent.

218
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,950
- You want us to kill a federal agent?  - I'll take care of him.

219
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,350
He went bad, helped the terrorists, dragged the company into it.

220
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,390
LAPD is responding to this area.

221
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,910
We'll have to do this quickly if we want to stay off their radar. Use that to keep in touch.

222
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,930
We spotted two men headed east on Addison.

223
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,970
Deploy your men in a flanking position a mile down the road and then move in.

224
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,190
We'll fan out and come in from behind.

225
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,220
You got it.

226
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,580
Give me that chopper back on the northwest corner.

227
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,610
Let's move!

228
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,510
Come on, this way.

229
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,220
This way.

230
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,800
Where do we go now?

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,060
Weapons and ammunition.

232
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,560
Get away from me! Get down!

233
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,420
Get out of here, or the next one won't miss!

234
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,300
I'm a federal agent.

235
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,820
Yeah, sure you are!

236
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,900
Get away from here!

237
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,000
Look, we need your help!

238
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,400
Go! now!

239
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,520
Okay, just relax.

240
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm leaving!

241
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,390
Okay, I'm leaving.

242
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,790
Drop the weapon. Now!

243
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,910
Kick the gun over to me.

244
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,770
Paul!

245
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,360
Get in here.

246
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,250
Pick up that gun.

247
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,190
My name is Jack Bauer.

248
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,850
I am a federal agent.

249
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,290
Well, you should have been here to help us to stop the looting.

250
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,400
You still have any rifles or they get them, too?

251
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,020
Behind the counter

252
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,840
Show me.

253
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,570
We're the first to be hit because everybody knows we're Arab Americans.

254
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,040
And we're good citizens.

255
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,510
We had nothing to do with what happened today!

256
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,760
Be quiet, Safah. He doesn't care.

257
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,740
Take what you need, but leave us two guns.

258
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,400
We've chased the looters off once, but they'll be back.

259
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,190
Just stay there.

260
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,890
Give me the keys.

261
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,520
What are you guys doing here?

262
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,060
We needed to take cover.

263
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,370
What do you mean?

264
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,650
Who's after you?

265
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,750
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.

266
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,820
I have critical evidence that I need to get

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,140
to the authorities.

268
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,140
The men that are chasing us are responsible for this blackout.

269
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,180
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.

270
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,380
It destroys all electrical activity

271
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,960
within an eight-mile radius.

272
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,110
So everything that's happened to us tonight... the looting,

273
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,130
the blackout... it's all because of the terrorists?

274
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,380
Yes, and the evidence that I have

275
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,510
can help prevent further attacks from happening.

276
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,320
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.

277
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,100
Commandos?

278
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,390
He's right.

279
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,460
You both need to leave this store.

280
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,340
Right now, we're their target.

281
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,580
You're not safe here with us.

282
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,530
Why don't you leave? This is our store.

283
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,210
If I had a choice, I would!

284
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,090
You have weapons and shelter.

285
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,870
Right now, there is no other place for us to be.

286
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,840
Can I talk to my brother for a second?

287
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,630
Stay where I can see you.

288
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,100
What's the plan?

289
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,310
CTU knows we're in trouble.

290
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,950
They also know we can't contact them.

291
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,390
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.

292
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,240
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived

293
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,780
in a military helicopter.

294
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,170
CTU had to see that on satellite.

295
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,050
If we can initiate a large enough fire fight,

296
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,810
we can force their commandos to use radio frequency

297
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,350
to communicate their positions.

298
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,160
And CTU will pick up the signal?

299
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,380
Yes.

300
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,060
So you want to engage

301
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,250
the McLennan-Forster army,

302
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,510
just the two of us?

303
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,230
We have a positional advantage,

304
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,610
and we only have to hold out until CTU gets here.

305
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,460
My brother and I talked about this.

306
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,300
We're staying.

307
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,470
I can't force you to leave your own property.

308
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,830
But this is not just a bunch of looters.

309
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,770
This is a very dangerous situation.

310
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,880
I can't guranttee your safety.

311
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,980
You don't understand. For years, we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.

312
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,800
We grew up in this neighborhood.

313
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,850
This country is our home.

314
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,590
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed,

315
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,260
then we'll help you.

316
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,660
I agree. The President should stay in the air

317
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,900
at least another hour, if not longer.

318
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,480
If he wants to speak to the nation,

319
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,490
he should do it from Air Force One.

320
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,910
Keep me informed.

321
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,300
I have an update on the damage

322
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,230
from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.

323
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,750
It's not quite as bad as we had feared.

324
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,740
How are you doing?

325
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,910
Sit down.

326
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,060
Any word from Jack or Paul?

327
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,680
No.

328
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,270
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.

329
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,450
There's something else, isn't there?

330
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,050
A couple of hours ago,

331
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,250
when we thought that Paul was somehow involved with the attacks,

332
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,150
Jack questioned him.

333
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,440
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...

334
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,820
Jack was pretty rough?

335
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,020
Very.

336
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,540
That's his job.

337
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,020
He had to make sure.

338
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,320
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.

339
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,270
I know, I guess it was just a shock to see it.

340
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,180
Somehow he seemed like a different person.

341
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,550
We need people like that, Audrey.

342
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,540
Jack is an incredible man. Just...

343
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,700
But you're not sure you feel the same way as you did before, is that it?

344
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,030
Something like that.

345
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,350
Could I speak to you for a moment?

346
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,540
It's important.

347
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,030
Okay. Um...

348
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,240
I don't have much time.

349
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,620
You're aware I was falsely accused

350
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,410
of leaking information earlier today.

351
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,260
- Yes, I saw the report.  - Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?

352
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,710
Her daughter died. I think she has other things on her mind.

353
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,990
I understand, but there are some things that still need to be handled.

354
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,060
What things?

355
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,190
She promised that it would be expunged from my record,

356
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,430
and I'd be bumped up two pay grades, so I want to make sure that will still happen.

357
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,710
I'II look into it, but not today.

358
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,990
What happened to me was an outrage.

359
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,070
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.

360
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,950
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.

361
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,740
I do. And I am ordering you to go back to work.

362
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,940
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.

363
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,590
- I need security to station one.  - Security?

364
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,630
What for?

365
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,190
I need people whose minds are on their jobs. Yours isn't.

366
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,890
So you're firing me? You can't. You need me. I'm juggling active protocols.

367
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,890
We'll manage.

368
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,390
Please escort Miss Gavin out of the building. Make sure you get her access card.

369
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,390
You'll be sorry for this. I promise you will.

370
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,820
Is the back entrance locked?

371
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,500
Yeah.

372
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,220
Okay.

373
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,200
Put one of these in each window.

374
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,620
Have extra ammunition standing by.

375
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,450
Then I want you to get two hunting vests,

376
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,170
fill all the pockets with empty clips. Go.

377
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,350
Miss Gavin won't be workingwith us anymore.

378
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,480
I'll need you two to divide her workload.

379
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,700
We're stretched pretty thin as it is.

380
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,780
Everyone on the floor is up to their necks already

381
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
or not qualified to replace her.

382
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,870
You may want to reconsider.

383
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,410
No, I don't trust her.

384
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,410
Then what about Agent Almeida?

385
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,900
Michelle, we could use the help, and he's already proved himself useful today.

386
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,500
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.

387
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,320
Yeah.

388
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,260
You'll be working with Agent Stiles

389
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,610
and manning for the rest of the day.

390
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,840
Edgar, I need you to call up Sarah's protocols.

391
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,650
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.

392
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,360
Okay.

393
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,010
I'll advise internal stations of the personnel changes.

394
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,180
Give me an update first.

395
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,910
The zone is still pretty quiet, except for emergency vehicle chatter.

396
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,720
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.

397
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,630
CTU's tact teams are standing by.

398
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,750
But the best we can do

399
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,270
is spread them around the perimeter, and wait for some sign of Jack.

400
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,470
I think that's a mistake.

401
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,770
We should consolidate our teams, meet strength with strength.

402
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,680
- Where would you place them?  - At McLennan-Forster.

403
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,680
Jack won't be far from there.

404
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,980
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.

405
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,580
He's gonna help us by starting a firefight. I know the way he thinks.

406
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,380
The hostiles will break radio silence when they attack.

407
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
When they do, we can follow the signal straight to where he is.

408
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,060
He's going to deliberately engage an entire team of commandos?

409
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,740
It's the most efficient way to be found.

410
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,740
And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.

411
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,740
Stick with the plan. Cover the perimeter.

412
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,540
Michelle.

413
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,770
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong,

414
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,830
Jack and Paul won't survive an attack.

415
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,450
If we cover the perimeter,

416
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,890
we may have a chance to save them.

417
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,590
Do it.

418
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,940
Castle, go ahead as planned. Be ready to move.

419
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,130
There's one of them.

420
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,230
It's time.

421
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,290
No one fires until I give the order.

422
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,420
- OK.  - All right.

423
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,680
Team leader, this is Specter.

424
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,040
I was just shot at.

425
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,750
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer, between Flower and Third.

426
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,900
Copy that.

427
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,720
- He's not returning fire.  - Because he's alone.

428
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,020
He's calling for backup now.

429
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,620
- And what do we do?  - Wait for them to come full force.

430
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,020
Just stay ready.

431
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,690
Audrey?

432
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,540
Yes?

433
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,910
Could you let DOD know that we've piggybacked

434
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,610
onto local law enforcement channels in the blackout zone?

435
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,320
I told them earlier we might need to use their feeds.

436
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,710
- So you don't need them any more?  - No.

437
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,030
All right, no problem.

438
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,790
Um, look, I didn't mean to be confrontational before.

439
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,630
Just... when you walk into a hailstorm,

440
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,850
you have to be decisive.

441
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,450
I understand, and I know where you're coming from.

442
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,910
I think that you're making the right decisions, but...

443
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,030
But what?

444
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,790
I think that you should reevaluate your professional opinion of Tony.

445
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,090
Why's that?

446
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,670
This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.

447
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,360
And he went to the one person that he knew

448
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,990
would come through for him and that was Tony.

449
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,160
Tony saved our lives.

450
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,360
I didn't know that.

451
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,020
After that, we just spent a couple hours with him.

452
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,010
It's true, Tony does have a lot of issues,

453
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,800
but he is good at what he does,

454
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,810
and I think that we could use him on a day like today.

455
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,500
Fair enough.

456
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,760
And business aside,

457
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,930
he still cares about you.

458
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,570
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.

459
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,600
Thanks.

460
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,500
Tony, look, I just want you to know that...

461
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,730
just because I overruled you a few minutes ago

462
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,010
doesn't mean that I don't value your input.

463
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,810
Don't patronize me, Michelle.

464
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,810
I'm not.

465
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,810
Look, you ran CTU for two years.

466
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,100
Anything that you have to say, I will consider seriously.

467
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:26,270
Don't worry. I'm gonna tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?

468
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,870
Good.

469
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,710
You guys scared?

470
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,400
You sure you both want to do this?

471
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,330
Yeah.

472
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,860
My brother and I,

473
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,410
we're more angry about these attacks today than you are.

474
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,910
So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna try to be part of the solution.

475
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,670
- I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.  - Yeah.

476
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,710
Our father left us this business when he died.

477
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,470
And he worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.

478
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,050
This store is his legacy,

479
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,810
but if he were here right now,

480
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,130
he'd be standing next to you,

481
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,930
just as we are.

482
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,690
Just stay low and do what I tell you.

483
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,070
Thank you...

484
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,180
for saving my life.

485
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,830
Yeah.

486
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,280
They're here.

487
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,450
Tony, Michelle just said that you were doing a search

488
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,400
on possible ties to Marwan. May I help?

489
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,640
Do you have a sign-on for the Zeitgeist server?

490
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,510
In Washington?

491
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,890
Yeah, it would save me time

492
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,280
if I could use it on this search.

493
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,810
Yeah.

494
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,300
There you go.

495
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,490
Thanks.

496
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,510
Anything else?

497
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,640
It should kick off a few names. You can help me

498
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,110
run them down once it's done searching.

499
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay, great.

500
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,370
So, um...

501
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,190
did you tell Michelle what happened today?

502
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,500
I said that Jack called you.

503
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,630
Anything else?

504
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,050
I didn't say that you were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.

505
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,890
She probably already knows that, and I'm sure she couldn't care less.

506
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,370
So how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?

507
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,450
It's different.

508
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,090
- A lot different than Washington.  - Yeah.

509
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,330
It is different.

510
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:45,710
To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when I heard that Jack had taken a deskjob in DC.

511
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,930
He said he was happier this way.

512
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,570
Uh-huh.

513
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,570
Well, you've gotten a chance to see him in both worlds today.

514
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,730
Think he'll go back to wearing a suit?

515
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,130
After the hell Jack's been through today, you think he'd want to come back to this?

516
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,210
Some people are more comfortable in hell.

517
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,180
Are you talking about Jack...

518
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,860
or yourself?

519
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,610
I think we found them!

520
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,240
See those signals underground?

521
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,130
Each one's a radio, all using the same frequency.

522
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,540
That's because they're planning an attack.

523
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,710
They converged on a location on Flower and Third,

524
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,460
about a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.

525
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,640
You were right, he's actually drawing them in.

526
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,620
Go, go!

527
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,900
Sporting goods store, across the street.

528
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,070
Let's move.

529
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,180
Bravo One, move in.

530
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,550
Infrared is picking up automatic weapon fire

531
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,860
at the site of the radio transmission.

532
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,710
How much longer before our teams get there?

533
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,420
The ground teams are closest. They'll get there first.

534
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,090
When?

535
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,790
At least five or six minutes.

536
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,140
Who's helping him?

537
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,150
I don't know.

538
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,030
They've got to be civilians.

539
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,900
We need to end this quickly and get that document.

540
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,300
Is that understood?

541
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,160
Yeah. I understand.

542
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,420
Let's go.

543
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,270
Hey, Naji! Hey!

544
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,390
Hey, are you hit? Hey?

545
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,350
You OK? Naji!

546
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,470
It hit the clip.

547
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,830
Naji.

548
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:49,890
Fall back!

549
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,600
All right! Now! Now!

550
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,650
Move forward!

551
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,710
Hurry! Take my shotgun.

552
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,710
Because of their night goggles, if they get within ten feet of you,

553
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,830
shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.

554
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,000
Jack!

555
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,560
Jack!

556
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,590
The gunfire stopped.

557
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,910
The teams on site?

558
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,640
Not yet.

559
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,950
Without enforce the commandos could have taken over the location.

560
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,520
Which means they might have taken the information back from Jack and Paul.

561
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,600
Get in touch with the teams.

562
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,460
I'll update Division.

563
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,080
If McLennan-Forster win the firefight,

564
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,700
what about Jack and Paul?

565
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,310
There is no way to tell.

566
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,380
CTU personnel are approaching the location.

567
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,030
CTU, this is Castle, we're about to engage.

568
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,110
How many hostiles have been sighted?

569
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,790
Six down outside, unknown number inside.

570
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,220
Lee, it's Tony. Are Jack and Paul still alive?

571
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,380
Unknown at this point.

572
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,440
All right, look, the hostiles cannot be allowed

573
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,960
to leave the area with the information Jack took from McLennan-Forster.

574
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,590
Do you understand?

575
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,810
We'll do the best we can.

576
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,060
No, Lee, listen to me.

577
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,920
Failure is not an option.

578
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,170
That information is what this whole thing is about.

579
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,590
Roger that.

580
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,170
Jack!

581
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,340
Yeah? I'm here!

582
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,990
- You and Raines safe?  - Yeah.

583
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,790
- All hostiles are down. We're clear.  - OK.

584
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,030
Go ahead.

585
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,870
This way.

586
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,810
- This is Castle. Get me CTU.  - Stand by.

587
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,970
- Curtis.  - It's Castle.

588
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,810
- Lee, what's your status?  - Location secured. Jack and Raines are safe.

589
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,590
- What about their information?  - Unknown at this point.

590
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,030
Keep this line open. Jack's OK. The team secured the store.

591
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,990
- What about Paul?  - He's with him.

592
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,150
- Has he anything from McLennan-Forster?  - We don't know yet.

593
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,150
Stay in touch. Whatever they get, be ready to work up.

594
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,030
You got it.

595
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,180
Yeah?

596
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,110
- You want us to help process?  - No. We'll do it when we sift the data.

597
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,310
- Sure that's not a problem?  - Yeah.

598
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,050
All right. We'll wait for your confirmation. 

599
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,910
Yeah.

600
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,200
Okay.

601
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,780
Jack and Paul are okay.

602
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,780
What about the information?

603
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,250
We don't know if Jack has it yet.

604
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,070
But even if he does, we don't know that he's going

605
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,580
to bring us any closer to finding Marwan.

606
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,350
Well, we know that McLennan-Forster is involved.

607
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,500
That should yield some leads.

608
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,140
Well, it's going to have to be worked up here,

609
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,150
because McLennan-Forster's computers were all knocked out by the EMP.

610
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,530
You want to head that up?

611
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,310
No. You know what? You should probably let Curtis handle that.

612
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,700
All right, I will.

613
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,070
I shouldn't have said that earlier about your drinking. I was out of line.

614
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,150
I'm sorry.

615
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,750
You don't owe me an apology.

616
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,390
My life right now...

617
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,510
Let's just say that I've been better.

618
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,590
Quite frankly, seeing you here today has only made things worse.

619
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,150
Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right?

620
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,030
No.

621
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,900
We can't afford to lose you.

622
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,070
Not today.

623
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,510
You're sure?

624
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,390
Yes.

625
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,060
Yes, I'm sure.

626
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,710
All right.

627
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,030
I'm going to make sure you get some help putting the store back together.

628
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,950
I appreciate that.

629
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,030
Thank you.

630
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,470
Thank you.

631
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,630
Lee, I need you to get this to CTU. It needs to get decoded immediately.

632
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,870
Set up a detail, five of your best men. 

633
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,860
Nothing happens to this store, do you understand me?

634
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,750
Jack, look out!

635
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,390
Paul?

636
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,660
Paul? Paul?

637
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,640
Medic!

638
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,510
Come on, stay with me.

639
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,650
Come on, Paul. Stay with me.

640
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,650
No, no, Paul.

641
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,710
Paul, stay with me. Come on, look at me.

642
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,810
Look at me. There you go.

643
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,660
Look at me.

644
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,690
I owed you.

645
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,240
You don't owe me anything. Just stay with me, okay?

646
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,250
Jack, it's OK. The medic's here.

647
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,490
Jack, let the medic do the work.

648
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,730
- Any problems?  - No, I'm here.

649
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,380
- Are we on schedule?  - Yes.

650
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,510
What about you?

651
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,510
I'm leaving now.

652
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,860
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.

653
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,320
We can't be late.

654
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


655
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,160
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.

2
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,210
Where is it?

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,350
You decide when the pain stops.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,120
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,930
Paul, where's the data printout?

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,790
I hid it.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,930
Is this it?

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,830
Yeah, it's in code.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,790
I couldn't make any sense out of it.

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,320
We're gonna get it back to CTU.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,800
Why don't bring her and everyone else up to speed.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,990
The man responsible for planning today's attacks, Habib

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,870
Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-forster.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,550
Jack Bauer and Paul Raines went to the company to inspect his computer files.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,020
As they were doing so, an electromagnetic pulse bomb

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,730
was detonated, wiping out the company's entire data base.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,200
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP thinks

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,970
Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated.

20
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,660
Where do we go now?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,070
Weapons and ammunition.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,060
Get out of here or the next one won't miss.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,890
I'm a federal agent.

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,170
Look, we need your help!

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,550
Who's after you?

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,800
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,550
I have critical evidence that I need to get to the authorities.

28
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,480
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed,

29
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,110
then we'll help you.

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,130
It's time.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,560
Jack!

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,760
I'm here!

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,860
You and Raines safe?

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,540
Yeah.

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,800
I need you to get this to CTU.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,510
It needs to get decoded immediately.

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,470
Jack, look out!

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,700
Paul...

39
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,790
Paul!

40
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,090
Get me a medic!

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,800
It is time for you to go.

42
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,700
Are you ready?

43
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,450
Yes, of course.

44
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,230
Proceed as planned.

45
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,370
The president of the united states is on a tight schedule.

46
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,760
We can't be late.

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,920
He's bleeding out!

48
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,740
Tell them on the ground we need two liters of a-positive hemo.

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,100
Come on, Paul, stay with us.

50
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,930
We're almost there.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,510
Hello?

52
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,710
Audrey, it's me.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,210
Oh, Jack, thank god you're all right.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,420
Audrey, I need you to listen to me.

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,470
Paul's been shot!

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,850
Audrey?

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,790
Audrey?

58
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,340
How bad is it?

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,780
The medics are working on him.

60
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,040
We'll be there in a few minutes.

61
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,610
Jack, how did this happen?

62
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,360
We were securing the area.

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,950
One of the gunmen tried to shoot me.

64
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,640
Paul pushed me out of the way.

65
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,200
He saved my life.

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,480
Audrey?

67
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,150
I'm here. I just...

68
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,380
Jack, I don't know what to say.

69
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,910
You don't have to say anything.

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,300
Surgeons have been notified.

71
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:35,860
They're standing by.

72
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,320
I want you to know we're going to do everything we have to.

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,490
You understand that?

74
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,460
Yeah, I understand.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,590
I got... I got to go.

77
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,000
See you in a minute.

78
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, okay.

79
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,430
Mr. President, all the evidence we've gathered confirms that this man,

80
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,580
Habib Marwan is directly responsible for everything that's happened today.

81
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,450
The train derailment, my abduction, the sabotage of our nuclear power plants...

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,510
Does any of your evidence suggest that he's planning more attacks?

83
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,390
I'm afraid so.

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
NSA is reporting a spike in chatter.

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,740
They're sifting through the intel now, trying

86
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,400
to determine potential targets and time frames.

87
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,820
"Trying" is not good enough.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
The chopper carrying Paul is about to land, sir.

89
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,250
We need to preempt any further attacks.

90
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,460
I understand, sir.

91
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,060
Our best chance to do that is by capturing Marwan.

92
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,830
How close are you?

93
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Jack Bauer recovered a document we believe contains contact data on Marwan's network.

94
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,140
CTU is using it to track Marwan.

95
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
And if that fails?

96
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,280
Mr. President, we just have to hope that it doesn't.

97
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,700
Jim, today's events are continuing to generate an unprecedented level of fear.

98
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,850
I'm not sure the social and civil fabric of this country can withstand another attack.

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,900
We need to make provisions.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,010
Provisions?

101
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,270
The civil unrest that I believe is inevitable

102
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,170
in the event of another terrorist strike.

103
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,800
Are you saying we should impose martial law?

104
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,420
I've asked General Wakefield to meet with you in Los Angeles to discuss our options.

105
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,350
When?

106
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:18,960
Now.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,930
His plane landed.

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,000
He'll be calling you to confirm a secure location.

109
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,240
And, Jim...

110
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,100
keep this between us.

111
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,130
Of course, Mr. President.

112
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,700
All right, he's losing pressure.

113
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,400
I need ten CC's of adrenaline, no compression.

114
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,070
Let's go.

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,110
Paul?

116
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,470
Paul, can you hear me?

117
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,170
- Got to get him into surgery now go!  -Paul...

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm sorry...

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,410
please, tell me he's not going to die.

120
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,080
Come here.

121
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,490
Jack, tell me.

122
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,060
We don't know.

123
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,060
We just don't know.

124
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,450
Jack, are you okay?

125
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,660
Yeah, I'm fine.

126
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,900
Listen, we were able to decode and pull a name of the list you sent us.

127
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,760
Who is it?

128
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,060
Someone on our watch list.

129
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,700
But we had no idea he was connected to Marwan.

130
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,300
Come on inside. We'll talk you through it.

131
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,210
I'm sorry, Mrs. Raines, you need to stay out

132
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,740
here while your husband's prepped for surgery.

133
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,990
Please, can I just talk to him for a second?

134
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,990
Paul, hey..

135
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,600
hey, it's Audrey.

136
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,930
Listen to me.

137
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,120
I just want you to know that I'm here, okay?

138
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,220
I'm here.

139
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,180
We need to prep him now.

140
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,190
And I will be here when you get out of surgery.

141
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,120
Do you understand me?

142
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,400
Paul...

143
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,040
His name's Joseph Fayed, associate professor at Green University.

144
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,060
Chemical engineering.

145
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,500
He came to the U.S. In 1985 to get his graduate degree.

146
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,490
We're sending in a team to pick him up now.

147
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,090
That's a mistake.

148
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,870
Why?

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,380
From everything that we've seen today,

150
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,200
Marwan's vetted his inner circle very carefully.

151
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,960
That man will die before he says anything.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,280
You're probably right, Jack, but what can we do besides arrest Fayed?

153
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,560
Send someone in undercover.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,260
Take a chance. They might lead us to Marwan.

155
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,690
Come on, Jack, you know we don't have the

156
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,300
time to put one of our own people undercover.

157
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,900
I'm not talking about one of our people.

158
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,050
Dina Araz.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,590
She's already made her deal, Jack.

160
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,890
We granted her son immunity.

161
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,060
We have nothing left to offer her.

162
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,060
Maybe, maybe not.

163
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,360
Let me talk to her while you mobilize a tactical team.

164
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,740
If I can't get her to cooperate by the time they're ready, send them in, but it's

165
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,450
simple we either find Marwan or we will

166
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,290
not be able to stop what he's planning next.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,570
Meet them at the hotel on Old River Road, half a kilometer from the base.

168
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,420
When?

169
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,870
Leave now.

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,810
I'll need his entire flight package,

171
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,180
including clearance and identification codes.

172
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,970
You'll have whatever you need.

173
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,540
Is that all you've got?

174
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,920
Oh, for now it is.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,960
Oh, come on.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,520
I haven't seen you in two weeks.

177
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah, I've got to get to the base.

178
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,240
I'm flying tonight.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
Damn, I'm going to be late as it is.

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,930
Look at me, I'm all wrinkled.

181
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,250
I wouldn't worry about that.

182
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,410
Hello.

183
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,390
It's for you.

184
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,000
What?

185
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,850
It's your wife.

186
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,990
That's your cell phone.

187
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,120
Laurie.

188
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,120
They've got guns, John.

189
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,830
They say they'll kill the children unless you do what they want.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
What's going on, Laurie? Who's there?

191
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,660
I don't know.

192
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,570
Listen to me,Laurie, whoever's there, you put them on the phone.

193
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,990
Please, John, don't let them hurt the children!

194
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,520
Laurie... Laurie.

195
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,920
Put your clothes on, John.

196
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,370
Curtis is prepping the tactical teams.

197
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,060
Which means you have five minutes to do this.

198
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,770
Do you recognize this man?

199
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,110
No.

200
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,140
He's connected to Marwan.

201
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,060
I don't know him.

202
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,390
I already told the other agent.

203
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,980
Marwan doesn't permit communication between cells.

204
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,260
His name is Joseph Fayed.

205
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,400
He's a professor at green university.

206
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,350
You know more about him than I do.

207
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,830
He's also our only way to reach Marwan.

208
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,180
We can't do that without your help.

209
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,090
Why should I help you?

210
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,130
I've already gotten all I'm going to get for cooperating.

211
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,230
That's not necessarily true.

212
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,610
I know you love your son.

213
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,410
You've already shown me that today.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,820
But unless you help us get to Fayed,

215
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,130
that will be the last time you see him for the rest of your life.

216
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,950
This is Dessler.

217
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,710
All right, have them stand by.

218
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,460
Tactical teams are ready.

219
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,640
They can be at Fayed's house in ten minutes.

220
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,920
Let's give him another minute.

221
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,820
I'm offering you your freedom, Dina.

222
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,700
You and Behrooz will be put in a witness protection program.

223
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,150
You'll be given new names, identities, everything.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,750
This is a better deal than you made earlier.

225
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,980
I'm offering you a life with your son.

226
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,040
Right now, the only question is: Which life do you want?

227
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,020
What do you need me to do?

228
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,980
I need you to go to Fayed and tell him that you need to speak to Marwan.

229
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,330
He won't let me through his front door, let alone get near Marwan.

230
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,360
He will when you tell him that you've got a hostage that can help him.

231
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,660
A hostage?

232
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,470
Who?

233
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,870
Me.

234
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,010
So what's this all about?

235
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,400
What are you doing?

236
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm delivering you to someone.

237
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,760
Who?

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,340
I don't know.

239
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,700
You don't know who you work for?

240
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,320
I work for myself.

241
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,160
Somebody's paying you.

242
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,620
I don't ask them who they are and they don't tell me.

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,800
That's how I stay alive.

244
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,590
All right, it's time.

245
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,030
If you don't cooperate, your family will die.

246
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,600
Do you understand?

247
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,370
It's all there.

248
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,280
Get out of here.

249
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,050
Get your things.

250
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,780
We got a plane to catch.

251
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,730
Increased chatter indicates that habib Marwan is planning another strike.

252
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,130
It's imperative that we locate him before he's able to trigger this.

253
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,000
We are mounting an undercover operation that

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,010
we hope will lead us to him through this man...

255
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,180
Joseph Fayed.

256
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,130
We've struck a deal with Dina Araz to work undercover for us,

257
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,290
and approach Fayed.

258
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,830
But Marwan knows we had Dina Araz in custody.

259
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,060
We're trying to use that to our advantage.

260
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,830
Jack will run us through the cover story we've fabricated.

261
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,020
The cover story goes as follows:

262
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,930
An hour ago,

263
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,350
I was transporting Dina Araz to the federal detention center when my vehicle

264
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,680
was attacked by the surviving members of a terrorist cell run by Navi Araz

265
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,350
at the intersection of sepulveda and national.

266
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,700
I managed to kill or wound all of the attackers.

267
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,050
But during the engagement,

268
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,500
Dina Araz secured one of the weapons and took me hostage.

269
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,220
She'll take me to Fayed.

270
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,820
Hopefully, he'll take me to Marwan.

271
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,090
And if Marwan takes the bait, we track you to him.

272
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,820
Yeah.

273
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,870
Now we have to assume they're going to search both Jack and Dina,

274
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,240
which is going to make tracking and surveillance devices a problem.

275
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,660
We're going to have to handle this passively.

276
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,610
We're going to use satellite, parabolics and laser aggregators.

277
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,730
But what about Dina Araz?

278
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,830
Do you think she'll be able to play this convincingly?

279
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,940
Well, she's managed to live here in the united states for

280
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,200
the past five years while part of a terrorist cell undetected.

281
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,160
Yes.

282
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,010
She's an expert at deception.

283
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,780
As long as she doesn't deceive us.

284
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,850
Right now, this is our best and only chance at finding Marwan.

285
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,990
But no matter how well we fabricate this story,

286
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,320
Jack will be in extreme and immediate danger.

287
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,150
We have to be able to move in at the first sign of trouble.

288
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,710
There is zero tolerance for error.

289
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,790
Thank you.

290
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,160
Good luck, everyone.

291
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,620
Curtis...

292
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,000
the detainees from McLennan-Forster have been taken over to division.

293
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,620
I want you to run the interrogation.

294
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,250
You got it.

295
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,320
Thank you.

296
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,190
Edgar...

297
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,360
I want you to call LAPD and Caltrans.

298
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,320
We need their logs to reflect that the ambush on Jack took place.

299
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,860
I need an exact time window.

300
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,100
He just finished telling us.

301
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,910
An hour ago.

302
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,760
I know.

303
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,870
I just didn't know if there was an updated scenario.

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,300
No, Edgar, you weren't paying attention.

305
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,070
Look, we can't afford for you to be losing focus at a time like this, all right?

306
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,620
I'm sick of people talking to me like I don't know what I'm doing.

307
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,870
Especially people who don't really work here.

308
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,380
Is there a problem with Edgar?

309
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,560
Well, his mother was caught in the

310
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,040
contamination zone at the San Gabriel Reactor.

311
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,880
She took her own life.

312
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,960
Now up till now he's been handling it pretty

313
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,240
well, but I think it may be catching up with him.

314
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,570
Do you think he's in good enough shape to run the comm part of this operation?

315
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,580
Based on what just happened?

316
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,230
No.

317
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,630
Where's Chloe?

318
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,290
I didn't see her on the active roster.

319
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,100
Driscoll forced her to resign.

320
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,100
Why?

321
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,120
Well, apparently, Chloe went against Driscoll's orders,

322
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,790
sided with Jack.

323
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,300
Turns out, Jack was right.

324
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,450
Thank you.

325
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,710
Hello?

326
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,030
Chloe, it's Michelle Dessler.

327
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,700
You're calling me from division?

328
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,720
Actually, I'm back at CTU.

329
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,310
Secretary Heller asked me to take Erin Driscoll's place.

330
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,610
She got fired?

331
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,850
That's too bad.

332
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,300
Listen, could you tell Edgar to upgrade the langley pattern recognition software?

333
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,970
He gets a little overwhelmed sometimes.

334
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
Yeah, I'll make sure he takes care of that.

335
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,570
Thanks.

336
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,350
Listen, Chloe,

337
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,010
you're better at what you do than anyone I've ever worked with.

338
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,550
I need you here.

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,950
Thank you for saying that, but I think I've had enough for today.

340
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,870
Chloe, this would be for Jack.

341
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,190
not just for CTU.

342
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,410
What are you talking about?

343
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,460
He's about to go undercover in a high-risk operation.

344
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,140
We need to mount a massive surveillance in very little time.

345
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,440
I don't have confidence that Edgar can do this on his own.

346
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,550
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.

347
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,480
Chloe...

348
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,650
I just need a few hours of your time, and then you can move on.

349
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
I just want to do everything I can to ensure Jack's safety.

350
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,360
Fine.

351
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,940
But it's just for today.

352
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,710
Thank you, Chloe.

353
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,730
You're welcome.

354
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,240
They're setting cars up at the ambush site in case Marwan wants to verify.

355
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,310
We're using the dead bodies of terrorists from Heller's rescue.

356
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,460
All right, the follow team will stay as close as they can,

357
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,660
but to tell you the truth, Jack,

358
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,360
you're flying without a net on this one.

359
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,920
If a hostile decides to take you out without warning,

360
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,790
there's nothing we can do.

361
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,400
I know.

362
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,250
Look, Audrey's still at the clinic.

363
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,010
There's time if you want to say good-bye.

364
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,430
She's got a lot on her mind right now.

365
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,340
Jack, she should know what you're about to do.

366
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,200
She's been through enough today.

367
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,020
Want you to look over the time line,

368
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,710
then we'll talk through the details.

369
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,220
I'm not doing anything until I see my son.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,560
We don't have time for that right now.

371
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,500
Seeing my son is non-negotiable.

372
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,800
Tony.

373
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,400
You need to learn every aspect of the cover story- your life depends on it.

374
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,500
Don't worry about me.

375
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
You can see your son, but only for a minute.

376
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,100
That's all.

377
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,400
Let's go.

378
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,700
Mom...

379
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,100
they wouldn't tell me where you were, or even if I was going to see you again.

380
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,700
We're going to be together.

381
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,100
What are you talking about?

382
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,400
They wouldn't let you come with me.

383
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,860
Everything has changed.

384
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,600
I agreed to do something for them, and they'll let me go with you.

385
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
What do they want you to do?

386
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,000
Help them find Marwan.

387
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,100
He's too dangerous.

388
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,900
Oh, I can handle Marwan.

389
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Please, mom...

390
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,600
no.

391
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,700
Don't worry.

392
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,500
I'll be fine.

393
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,500
Please, mom.

394
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,800
Mrs. Araz, it's time.

395
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,300
Is field surveillance in place yet?

396
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
We have audio.

397
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,400
There might be some dead spots, but we should be able to hear inside the house.

398
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,200
That's assuming they get that far.

399
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,400
Okay, thank you

400
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah.

401
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,800
Come on, come on.

402
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,300
Why aren't you going through?

403
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,260
Damn it!

404
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,260
Use a danziger filter.

405
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,700
You can download it internally if you know what you're doing.

406
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
There, you're in.

407
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,900
Chloe, what are you doing here?

408
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,700
Michelle thought you could use some help.

409
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,400
Offload your task list at station 12.

410
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,200
I'll cover your overflow.

411
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,700
I can handle my assignment.

412
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,360
Well, obviously you can't.

413
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Otherwise Michelle wouldn't have called me in.

414
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,900
Edgar, I meant to tell you before Chloe got here.

415
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,710
Look, ms. Dessler.

416
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,360
I can do my job.

417
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,960
I don't need any help.

418
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm not saying you can't, but I'm not taking any chances either.

419
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,600
Look, I realize we got off to a rocky start, but...

420
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,600
Edgar, this isn't a debate.

421
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,500
It's an order.

422
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,800
Now, brief Chloe so she can run satellite with you, and do it fast.

423
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,800
Jack's approaching the staging area.

424
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,900
This is Baron.

425
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,600
This is Dessler, we're set on our end.

426
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Satellite and surveillance teams are in place.

427
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,800
Go in at your discretion.

428
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,660
Roger that.

429
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,600
We'll leave this line open.

430
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,600
We're going in alone?

431
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Our agents are conducting audio surveillance with mobile parabolics.

432
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,400
What does that mean?

433
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,600
Acknowledge that you hear me.

434
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,700
Copy that.

435
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,800
What are you doing?

436
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,300
I have to make it look like I was injured during the attack.

437
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Take my gun.

438
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,000
This has to look as convincing as possible.

439
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,000
Take my gun.

440
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,600
You must know that I want to kill you.

441
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,100
Yes.

442
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,800
But I know you won't because of Behrooz.

443
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,800
Let's go.

444
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,100
They're going in.

445
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,300
We're standing by.

446
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,700
What if Fayed doesn't believe us?

447
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,400
Then we're both dead.

448
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,700
Who is it?

449
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Joseph, it's Dina Araz.

450
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,800
Who?

451
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,100
Dina Araz.

452
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm a friend.

453
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,100
My husband is Navi.

454
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,200
He's been killed.

455
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

456
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,560
Now please go away.

457
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
I need to speak to Marwan.

458
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I don't know any Marwan.

459
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,200
Yes, you do.

460
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,760
Go away before I call the police.

461
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,000
You won't call the police, and we both know why.

462
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,400
What do you want?

463
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,200
I have a hostage.

464
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,500
Someone Marwan will want.

465
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,200
His name is Jack Bauer.

466
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,800
He's a CTU agent.

467
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,100
Now please, let me in before someone sees me.

468
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,360
Close the door!

469
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:04,900
Put your gun over there!

470
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,800
Do it!

471
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
How did you find me?

472
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,860
My husband told me.

473
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,300
I don't know your husband.

474
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,300
He knew you.

475
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,100
Tell me what happened.

476
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,770
My husband was killed and I was arrested.

477
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,100
They were transporting me to CTU.

478
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,300
I heard an explosion, and the van we were driving crashed.

479
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,900
It was our people...

480
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,900
they came to rescue me.

481
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,760
Everyone fell except Bauer and me.

482
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,900
He was wounded, and I managed to get his gun.

483
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Where did this happen?

484
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,700
At the intersection of sepulveda and national.

485
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Half a mile from here.

486
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Don't move.

487
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,700
What is it?

488
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
The is Fayed.

489
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,100
A woman named Dina Araz came to me.

490
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,700
How did she find you?

491
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,700
She claims her husband told her.

492
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,900
What does she want?

493
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,700
She wants to bring you a hostage.

494
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,400
A CTU agent named Jack Bauer.

495
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Jack Bauer?

496
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,500
Can you break into the other side of the conversation?

497
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,400
No. The call's being piped through a satellite switcher.

498
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,700
The signal's scrambled.

499
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,400
As she was being transported our people ambushed the

500
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,900
vehicle at the intersection of sepulveda and national.

501
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,500
Everyone was killed, but she managed to escape with Bauer.

502
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,100
What do you want me to do?

503
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,800
Bring them to me.

504
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,100
I will call you back in five minutes with the details.

505
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,200
Be ready.

506
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,000
Do you understand?

507
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,600
Yes.

508
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I understand.

509
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,200
Marwan wants to see him.

510
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Baron, it's a go.

511
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,760
I heard.

512
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,900
Set a follow grid, and we'll coordinate from our end.

513
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,800
Evening, sir.

514
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,100
Evening.

515
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,400
Pop the trunk for me, sir.

516
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,700
Since when are you searching officer's cars at the gate, sergeant?

517
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,300
An elevated threat level.

518
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,600
Okay, you're good to go, sir.

519
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,300
Thank you.

520
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,400
I'm on base.

521
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,000
Continue to the next phase.

522
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,150
Okay, I got you on base.

523
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,060
Let me talk to my family.

524
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,520
- Open the trunk, captain.  - Let me talk to my wife.

525
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,900
I said open the trunk.

526
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,100
Please...

527
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,720
let me talk to my family.

528
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,250
Your family is dead...

529
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,500
And so are you.

530
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,860
Mrs. Raines, your husband sustained bullet wounds to his chest and abdomen.

531
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,650
Now, we were able to extract one of the bullets, but I've called

532
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,500
a neurosurgeon in from Cedars to help extract the second bullet.

533
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,100
Why a neurosurgeon?

534
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,870
Well, the bullet is lodged against his t-5 vertebrae and

535
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,100
we want to be careful to avoid any further spinal trauma.

536
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,800
I can't believe this is happening.

537
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,900
I'll let you know as soon as I get any news on his condition.

538
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,600
Thank you.

539
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,300
Dad...

540
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,400
I don't think I realized how much I cared for Paul until now.

541
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,000
I know this is terrible timing, but the president has called and I have to leave.

542
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,300
You'll be able to reach me on my number.

543
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,500
The doctors will keep me up to speed here.

544
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
Okay.

545
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,000
I love you, Audrey.

546
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,400
And I'm proud to be your dad.

547
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,600
I love you, too.

548
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,100
Be careful.

549
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,800
Where are you taking me?

550
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,400
Shut up!

551
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,200
How far are we going?

552
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,300
It won't be long.

553
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,600
You look nervous.

554
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,600
What do you expect?

555
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,800
I wouldn't have contacted you if I felt I had a choice.

556
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,200
And as a result, I have no choice.

557
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,800
We do whatever we have to for the cause.

558
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,500
So what's the problem?

559
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,000
There is no problem.

560
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,000
He's approaching an intersection.

561
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,560
They're turning off olympic.

562
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,100
Moving to next sub-channel.

563
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,300
He's turning onto a side street.

564
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Collier avenue.

565
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,800
Hold that distance.

566
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,900
Understood.

567
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,700
He's heading towards the broad street tunnel.

568
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,800
He's slowing down.

569
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,900
Baron, drop back.

570
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,700
Can't afford to have them spot the tail.

571
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,600
We're backing off.

572
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,700
He's turning into the tunnel.

573
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,500
Maintain your distance.

574
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,900
He's too far ahead for the parabolic.

575
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,900
I couldn't be able to hear what's going on in there.

576
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,560
The tunnel's 400 yards long.

577
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,700
They'll be out of satellite view for approximately 20 seconds.

578
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,900
Pull in front of this truck.

579
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,700
What's going on?

580
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,960
Out of the car!

581
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,500
What are you doing?!

582
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,700
From Marwan.

583
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,000
Yes.

584
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,700
This is taking too long.

585
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,800
We got them. They're out of the tunnel.

586
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,900
Do you have a visual?

587
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,100
That's it.

588
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,200
We've got them up ahead.

589
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,000
Fayed's turning onto Napier.

590
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,700
Napier loops back around to olympic.

591
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,500
That means he just spent the last five minutes driving in a circle.

592
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,200
Maybe he's trying to detect surveillance.

593
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,900
Chloe, can you switch to infrared?

594
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,700
Hold on.

595
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,700
There's only one person in the car!

596
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,000
They made a switch in the tunnel!

597
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,300
Baron, the covert part of the operation is over.

598
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,200
All teams move in on the target car.

599
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Alpha team, cut him off at the bridge. We're right behind.

600
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,200
Establish a perimeter around the area.

601
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,960
Stop and search all vehicles.

602
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,960
Chloe, do you have anything on satellite?

603
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,150
Nothing around the immediate area of the target's car.

604
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,300
Can you go back into archives and find out what happened?

605
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,900
Yeah, it's going to take a few minutes.

606
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,760
Do it.

607
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,200
Baron, what's your status?

608
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,300
Closing in now.

609
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,200
We got him surrounded on the bridge.

610
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,770
Passenger side.

611
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,770
On your left.

612
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,680
Flank him.

613
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,800
Get out of the car and put your hands up now!

614
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,000
Out of the car!

615
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,500
Bomb!

616
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
Oh, my god.

617
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,600
Marwan set us up.

618
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,260
Almeida.

619
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,900
Agent Baron's dead.

620
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,060
So is Fayed.

621
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Is there any sign of Jack?

622
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,660
No, not yet.

623
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,200
Any other hostiles in the area?

624
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,600
The area looks secure.

625
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,360
Okay.

626
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,200
I'll get you another back up team as soon as I can.

627
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,800
I've the archives satellite footage.

628
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,700
Play it back..

629
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,100
Okay, during the time Fayed's car is in the tunnel, three vehicles exit.

630
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,100
Check the van.

631
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,500
Can you get me a license number on that?

632
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,500
Not from the satellite. Let me check the traffic cameras.

633
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,900
Edgar, get me the caltrans interface.

634
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,800
We have a socket open.

635
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,600
Logging in.

636
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,300
Done.

637
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,000
Okay, there's a camera at the entrance to the tunnel.

638
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,500
Looking for the right frame.

639
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,200
Got it.

640
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,660
Send this out to all the field teams.

641
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
I want interagency support on setting up the grid.

642
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,400
I'm on it.

643
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,730
We have an ID on the vehicle: White chevy van, late

644
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,600
'90s, license plate charlie victor alpha, three-two-two.

645
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,900
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

646
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm sorry for your loss, Dina.

647
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,900
Navi was a great man.

648
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
I hope my men weren't too rough with you.

649
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,900
It was necessary, in case you were under surveillance.

650
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,700
I understand.

651
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,500
But we weren't followed, I was careful.

652
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,500
You're a good liar, Dina.

653
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,860
What?

654
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,860
Fayed martyred himself.

655
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,200
The men who were following you are dead.

656
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,060
What men?

657
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,800
Enough with the lies!

658
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,200
Marwan, please believe me.

659
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
I did not betray you.

660
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,800
Prove it to me.

661
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,500
Kill him.

662
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,000
Just what I thought.

663
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,800
Get him out of here.

664
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


665
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,400
Jack, look out!

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,120
Paul!

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,410
Get me a Medic!

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,200
Medic!

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,960
Losing pressure, I need 10ccs...

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,460
It happened so fast, he was hit before I could do anything

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,590
How bad is it?

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,390
We don't know.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,100
We just don't know.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Please tell me he's not going to Die.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,990
Why should I help you?

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,990
I'm offering you your Freedom, Dina.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,290
You and behrooz will be put in the witness protection program.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,210
You'll be given new Names, identities, everything.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,090
What do you need me to do?

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,010
I need you to go to Fayed and tell him that you need to speak to marwan.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,230
He won't let me through his front door let alone get near marwan.

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,030
He will when you tell him that you've got a hostage that can help him.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,700
Who?

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,620
Me.

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,330
What If rayed doesn't believe us?

22
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,290
Then we're both dead.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,170
Close the door!

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,670
Put your Gun over there.

25
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,680
Do it!

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,390
What is it?

27
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,390
A woman named Dina araz came to me.

28
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,610
What does she want?

29
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,980
She wants to bring you a hostage.

30
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,110
A ctu agent name Jack bauer.

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,500
Caused me a lot of trouble, Mr. Bauer.

32
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,100
kill him.

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,530
just what I thought.

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,530
Dina!

35
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,540
No!

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,480
Meet them at the hotel.

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,990
I'll need his entire flight package, including clearance and identification codes.

38
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,610
You'll have whatever you need.

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,490
Get your things.

40
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,500
We got a plane to catch.

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,290
Let me talk to my family.

42
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,590
Your family is dead.

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,590
And so are you.

44
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,690
Edgar, have you found any way to locate Jack?

45
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,200
We're trying, but marwan wasn't stupid, he covered his tracks.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Michelle.

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,000
What do we have, Chloe?

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,210
Local pd found the Van that Jack and Dina were in.

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,920
Where?

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,930
It was abandoned at an industrial warehouse at the far end of San Fernando road.

51
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,930
Dina's body was in it.

52
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,430
Okay.

53
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,810
Tell local police to look for witnesses.

54
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,820
We need a license Plate, something to follow.

55
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,530
Edgar, pull up satellite from 8:45 to 9:00.

56
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:57,910
I'm on it.

57
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,910
All right, everyone, listen up.

58
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,330
Jack bauer is missing.

59
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,220
There's a good chance he's being held by our primary target, Habib marwan.

60
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,810
Because we believe marwan is preparing for another domestic attack today, 

61
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,810
we need to Pool all our resources to find him.

62
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,110
All comm teams coordinate with Edgar.

63
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,620
Thank you.

64
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,720
yes?

65
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,220
There's a problem.

66
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,930
What?

67
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,480
I got onto the Base and through both layers of security using the pilot's Id.

68
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,110
Just as I was about to do a pre-flight check, they grounded the plane.

69
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,400
Why?

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
Checking a trouble sensor.

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,290
Might have to swap out a defective part.

72
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,100
How long will it take?

73
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,020
I don't know yet.

74
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,810
Resolve this now.

75
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,820
It's time to earn your money, Mr. Anderson.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,910
Your window of opportunity on the target closes in an hour.

77
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,120
I understand.

78
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,320
Excuse me.

79
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,900
Yes, Sir?

80
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,490
You working on the Phoenix?

81
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,910
Yes, Captain, they sent me down from Hawkins.

82
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,120
You taking her up?

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,500
That's the plan, what's the ETA on getting me in the air?

84
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,300
Well, trouble sensor was correct, Sir.

85
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,220
There was a hairline fracture in one of your strut pins.

86
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,600
But, uh, replacement won't be in till morning.

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,610
is that the only problem, strut pin?

88
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,610
Well, yes, Sir, but it would be one Hell of problem when you tried to land.

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,040
Rear assembly would disintegrate on Impact.

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,420
Only way out would be to Parachute out and Hope the jet doesn't come down on anyone.

91
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,550
Did you make your report to the chief mechanical Officer?

92
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,550
I was just about to head over there right now, Captain.

93
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,640
And then I'm going to head up to Ventura for a little rest

94
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,400
Sounds great.

95
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,190
Don't let me hold you up.

96
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,190
Thank you, Sir.

97
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,420
Thanks.

98
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,010
M.E. Says Dina's been dead for less than 30 minutes.

99
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,440
We can only assume that's when marwan grabbed Jack.

100
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,530
What's the search Range on Jack and marwan?

101
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,820
1500 Square miles, but it's increasing by the minute.

102
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
What about chatter?

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,620
Well, I filtered through everything that came from Langley, Nsa and interpol.

104
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,630
None of it's correlating right now.

105
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,550
And volume?

106
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,220
It's actually slowing down.

107
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,060
Which May mean that we've incurred all the damage we will today.

108
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,850
Or it could be the calm before the Storm.

109
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,060
Yeah.

110
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,910
The one thing we know for sure is If Jack's alive, he'll find a way to contact us.

111
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,620
We'll just have to wait until we pick up a thread on marwan.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah.

113
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,130
Tony.

114
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,140
Yup?

115
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,640
I heard Jack called you earlier today.

116
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,730
Yeah.

117
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,740
And that you saved his life?

118
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,830
Well, we both know I owed him one, right?

119
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,640
Look, Audrey's been waiting for her husband to get out of surgery.

120
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,440
I think we should tell her about Jack.

121
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Why?

122
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,820
They're involved.

123
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,620
She's married.

124
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
Separated.

125
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,420
Well, then I'd prefer not to tell her anything.

126
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,210
Why?

127
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,630
Because we May have to make a very tough call on how Jack's capture plays out.

128
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,220
Well, Michelle, she's a professional.

129
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,520
She knows that's a possibility.

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,310
I think it'd be wrong to keep it from her.

131
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,110
I don't want her interfering.

132
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,110
I think she has a right to know.

133
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,250
But, Hey, you're the boss, it's your call.

134
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,120
excuse me.

135
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,420
How's Paul doing?

136
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,840
He's still in surgery.

137
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
I won't know until he gets out.

138
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,930
Have you heard anything from Jack?

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,570
Jack is missing.

140
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,950
Missing?

141
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,910
We think he was taken by Habib marwan.

142
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,000
My God...

143
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,420
What are we doing to get him back?

144
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
everything we can.

145
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,800
How did this happen?

146
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,140
I thought we were tracking him.

147
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,310
He's supposed to be protected.

148
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,440
No one is fully protected in the field.

149
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,530
Who was in charge of this operation?

150
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,030
I was.

151
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,250
Get him back, Michelle.

152
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,870
I have a few simple questions.

153
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,620
If you answer them, there's a chance you might survive today.

154
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Don't waste your time.

155
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,020
You located me through a man named Joseph fayed, who you might be interested to know has since martyred himself.

156
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,240
It would help me If I knew he was the only Link you had to me.

157
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,960
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail.

158
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,130
Just like everything else you've tried today.

159
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,630
Fail?

160
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,770
Almost 40 dead in a Train crash, many more near the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.

161
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,070
That wasn't really your plan, was it?

162
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,660
We managed to stop the other 103 power plants from melting down.

163
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,450
That's what America will remember, that we stopped you.

164
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,120
No.

165
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,510
They'll remember the image of Secretary of defense heller held hostage on your own soil,

166
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,510
and it will Burn in their psyches.

167
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,520
This country will forever be afraid to let their leaders appear in public.

168
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,530
For all the hatred that you have for this country, you don't understand it very well.

169
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,130
Whatever you throw at us, I promise you, that'll never happen.

170
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,160
Marwan, we have a problem.

171
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,240
What is it?

172
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,250
The family of the pilot that we killed.

173
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,170
What about them?

174
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,210
We disposed of the bodies, right?

175
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,930
Yes, yes, but a relative showed up at the house and became suspicious when no one was home.

176
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,930
He called the police who are now looking into it.

177
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,730
Has it gotten to ctu yet?

178
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,320
No, but this man was a military pilot.

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,530
It will be flagged by other agencies and it will get to ctu within the hour.

180
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,330
What do you think we should do?

181
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,130
We have to make sure ctu is too busy to realize its significance.

182
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,550
Distract them.

183
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,550
How?

184
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,750
Tell me about the boy.

185
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:02,880
What boy?

186
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,840
Behrooz araz.

187
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,510
What do you care about him for?

188
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,640
Does ctu have him in custody?

189
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Yes. He's safe.

190
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,660
You answered the question, but are you telling me the truth?

191
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,250
Call ctu, ask them yourself.

192
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,820
Edgar Stiles.

193
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,950
What's the new password for the Server?

194
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,250
For the central Server?

195
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,040
I'll get you on.

196
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,550
No, don't get me on. Give me the password so I can access it whenever I want to.

197
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,550
It's not your area anymore.

198
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,260
What are you talking about?

199
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,850
You work for me.

200
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,350
No. I worked for you. Worked. With an -ed at the end. Past tense.

201
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,940
Edgar, I've been reinstated.

202
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,150
So quit being territorial and just give me the password.

203
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,160
No.

204
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,820
Curtis, could you please explain to Edgar that I have been re-hired to resume my position as head of comm?

205
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,030
Things have changed, Chloe.

206
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,160
Edgar took over for you.

207
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
You'll be working for him now.

208
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,250
You're kidding.

209
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,260
Michelle called me in because things were falling apart here under Edgar.

210
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,770
Now give me my command or I walk.

211
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,070
You'll have equal authority, just on Paper it has to look like you work for him.

212
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,360
Well, I'm not going to do that. It's a matter of Principle.

213
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,780
You'll be bumped up to a term four analyst.

214
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,580
That's a 35% Increase in salary plus bonus.

215
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,960
Well, I should be getting that anyway.

216
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,380
That's not my point.

217
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,470
Edgar works for me.

218
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,470
Not today, Chloe.

219
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,520
Fine...

220
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,650
What's the password to the central Server?

221
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,150
C-I-s-one-five-a.

222
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,160
Thanks.

223
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,530
Curtis!

224
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,750
A man who says he's Habib marwan is on line one.

225
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,670
He wants to speak to the director of ctu.

226
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,750
Put it through a Hi-res filter.

227
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,760
Activate all tracers and recorders.

228
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,470
Michelle, someone claiming to be Habib marwan is on the line.

229
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,980
Are you prepped for the call?

230
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,350
Yeah.

231
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,360
Take it there.

232
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Put him through.

233
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,670
This is Michelle dessler, director of ctu.

234
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,880
To whom am I speaking?

235
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,590
This is Habib marwan.

236
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,180
Jack bauer is alive and in my custody.

237
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,470
I'll need to speak to him.

238
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,900
I will return him to you unharmed in exchange for behrooz araz.

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,740
I will give you ten minutes to secure clearances with your people.

240
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,660
I need more time before I can agree to that.

241
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,950
Ten minutes.

242
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,460
I will call you then with exact details on how the exchange is to proceed.

243
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,470
Did you get a Trace?

244
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,970
No.

245
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,260
Okay, confirm marwan's identity off voice.

246
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,270
And process behrooz araz.

247
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,850
got it.

248
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,280
Why is behrooz araz Worth trading for Jack?

249
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,780
I don't know.

250
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,080
Have all tactical teams meet me in the situation room.

251
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Yeah.

252
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,280
Sent the report about the pilot and his missing family to ctu yet?

253
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,780
I don't think so.

254
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,580
But our contact at lapd said that the report has been flagged.

255
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,460
It will go out to all the agencies within the next 15 minutes.

256
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,180
If ctu gets a hold of it, even a minute too soon, they'll be able to stop us.

257
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,770
You need to tell me the second that report gets released.

258
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,770
Yes, marwan.

259
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,740
Marwan wants to exchange Jack bauer for behrooz araz.

260
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,870
The obvious question is why.

261
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
The way I see it, there are two possibilities.

262
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,040
One, there's a personal connection.

263
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,470
Two, behrooz has information that can damage marwan.

264
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,760
I agree.

265
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,770
Edgar, have your team sift through everything we have on behrooz araz.

266
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,480
Go back as far as you can and see If there's a family Link between him and marwan.

267
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,380
Did the initial interrogation reveal that behrooz knew anything

268
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,080
that might make him valuable to marwan?

269
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,170
No, but main focus was on the mother.

270
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,960
We really didn't push him very hard.

271
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,470
Curtis, push harder.

272
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,970
See what you can find.

273
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,970
But do it now.

274
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,770
My guess is marwan will want to make this exchange within the hour.

275
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,400
Tony, monitor him from the observation room.

276
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,780
Chloe, what do we have on audio?

277
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,240
I was able to get some voice memos from mclennan-Forster.

278
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,450
The voice print matched.

279
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,160
It was marwan's.

280
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,670
How are you going to handle this?

281
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,750
The kid thinks his mother made a deal to protect him.

282
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,180
The first thing I have to do is let him think that the deal is off.

283
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,050
We can't use a psychological approach.

284
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,760
It's too slow.

285
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,850
What are you suggesting?

286
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,270
I think he's just going to drag his feet unless we put some physical pressure on him.

287
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,780
He's just a scared kid.

288
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,780
I'm pretty sure he's given us everything he knows.

289
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,780
You're pretty sure?

290
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,580
I'll call Richards.

291
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,670
Tony...

292
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,670
Go ahead... I'll catch up.

293
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,180
Have you heard anything on Jack?

294
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,390
Yeah, we just got some information a couple of minutes ago.

295
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,890
Why didn't you let me know?

296
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,900
I'm sorry, Audrey, but things are going pretty fast here.

297
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,990
Look, Jack's alive.

298
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,700
He is being held by marwan.

299
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,160
How did you confirm that?

300
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,740
Marwan contacted us.

301
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,370
He contacted you?

302
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,460
Why would he do that?

303
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,250
He wants to make a trade.

304
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,260
Jack for behrooz.

305
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,350
When is that going to happen?

306
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,770
We don't know If it is.

307
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,190
What do you mean?

308
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,480
Look, If he wants to make this trade, that means behrooz has tactical value.

309
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,990
If that's the case, then we May have to hold on to him.

310
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,870
Look, there's a lot of stuff we have to go over before anything happens.

311
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,170
I'll keep you posted, but right now I have to get in that room with behrooz, all right?

312
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,600
Thank you.

313
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,690
All right, keep it at that level.

314
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,910
Let me know If the readings fluctuate.

315
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,980
Remember, he doesn't know that his mother's dead.

316
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
I know.

317
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,580
Hello, behrooz.

318
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
How much longer do I have to stay here?

319
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,090
These things take time.

320
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,670
Where is my mother?

321
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,670
She's still in the field.

322
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,590
With Jack bauer?

323
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,600
Is she okay?

324
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah.

325
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
She's fine.

326
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,910
Tell me about Habib marwan.

327
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,870
Why are you doing this?

328
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,960
Habib marwan.

329
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,470
Your mother gave us a little information.

330
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,970
She said you could give us some more.

331
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,180
You promised you wouldn't Hurt me!

332
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,350
Please, get this Guy away from me.

333
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,860
Back over here.

334
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
We're just going to have a little talk.

335
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,990
Marwan's the leader.

336
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,990
That's all I know.

337
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,160
I heard my parents talk about him, that's it.

338
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,600
Go ahead.

339
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,190
What are you going to do?

340
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,990
What is he going to do to me?

341
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,910
sorry, behrooz.

342
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:37,990
We just don't have a lot of time.

343
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,420
No, no, no!

344
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,880
This is marwan.

345
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,550
Get me Michelle dessler.

346
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,560
Miss dessler, it's marwan!

347
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Everyone, on this!

348
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,290
This is dessler.

349
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,790
Union conduit dam, 

350
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,500
North entrance. 30 Minutes.

351
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,670
I need to know Jack bauer's still alive.

352
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,800
Very well.

353
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,810
Michelle dessler wants to make sure you're alive.

354
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,820
I'm being held in an abandoned warehouse, somewhere downtown...

355
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,120
Satisfied?

356
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,200
I don't know If I can make this happen in 30 minutes.

357
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,920
You'll find a way.

358
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Wait...

359
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,680
Damn it!

360
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,060
Ctu will never go through with the exchange.

361
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,900
I'm expendable.

362
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,990
Yes. You are.

363
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
If behrooz is a value to you, he's a value to them.

364
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,160
They'll never let you have him back.

365
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,330
Marwan.

366
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,420
The police report file has been distributed.

367
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,210
In the next few minutes, ctu will be alerted that a military pilot and his family are missing.

368
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,050
All right.

369
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,700
Chloe, the hourlies from lapd are here.

370
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,000
What do you usually do with them?

371
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I go through them and promote any flagged items to the analysts.

372
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't do that now.

373
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,380
I have to get ready for the call from marwan.

374
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,510
Well, I can't do it either.

375
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,590
I'm working on tracking behrooz.

376
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,180
But I'd get on those hourlies If I were you.

377
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,390
Well, you're not me.

378
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,400
I'll hand it off to Meg, tell her to sift through it, and deal with any flagged items when we're done with the exchange.

379
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,490
Okay, boss.

380
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,710
this is Meg.

381
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,710
Meg, hourlies from local Law enforcement just came in.

382
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,300
Chloe and I need you to sift through them.

383
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,930
Do you know how backed up we are down here?

384
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,180
Yeah, well, it's worse up here.

385
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,180
Just do it, okay?

386
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Fine. Send us a four.

387
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,890
Phoenix is ready to go.

388
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,400
I thought we were waiting on a part.

389
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,190
It's a good thing they called me in for a second opinion.

390
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,110
Aft strut's fine... It was just a faulty trouble sensor.

391
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,200
You sure?

392
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,700
Absolutely, I triple checked it.

393
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,420
It was just a false alarm.

394
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,420
Here is my report.

395
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,190
All right, I'll clear it for take-off.

396
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,790
This is Miller.

397
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,210
Phoenix is clear for take-off all right.

398
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,720
Chloe, what's wrong?

399
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,220
Nothing.

400
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,020
I mean, there's no bad news about Jack yet, If that's what you're asking.

401
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,970
Since Jack and your father aren't here, 

402
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,770
you're the Official dod representative,

403
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,780
so these are some Standard non-disclosures.

404
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,290
Read them whenever you get a chance. I flagged where you need to sign.

405
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
I'll do that now.

406
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm really sorry about your husband.

407
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,690
Thank you.

408
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,490
I can't imagine how I'd be feeling right now If I were you.

409
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm feeling like someone who's afraid of losing her husband.

410
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,630
No, I meant you know, you and your husband are separated...

411
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,010
And you've fallen in love with Jack, I guess,

412
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,310
and then you end up together, and your husband takes a bullet but saves Jack's life?

413
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,520
What do you do with that?

414
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,730
I can't think about that right now, Chloe, okay?

415
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,190
I just need Paul to pull through this.

416
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,490
What about Jack?

417
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,280
You just assume the terrorists aren't going to kill him?

418
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,370
Chloe, I don't want to talk about it.

419
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,090
Here.

420
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,090
I was inappropriately Blunt, wasn't I?

421
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,590
I do that a lot.

422
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Sorry.

423
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Sorry, I'm going to go.

424
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,820
I have a... A field meeting anyway.

425
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,140
when you said your father spoke to marwan, was that on the phone or did he come to your house?

426
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,150
Both.

427
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,990
Did you ever speak to marwan alone, away from your parents?

428
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,000
No.

429
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,800
When they made the preparation for today's attacks, were you in the room?

430
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,890
I told you.

431
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,890
They didn't want me in there.

432
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,610
Almeida.

433
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,110
Tony, the briefing's about to start.

434
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,110
All right, I'll be right there.

435
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,330
If he produces something relevant,

436
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,330
let me know. I'll be in the briefing.

437
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,800
O'Brian.

438
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,810
Chloe, is anything you're doing up there yielding a military connection?

439
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,230
No. Why?

440
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,240
It May be nothing, but the county hourly's contain an incident report that might be Worth looking at.

441
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,410
What is it?

442
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,500
An air force pilot's wife and kids reported missing as of two hours ago.

443
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,800
Two hours ago?

444
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,590
How can someone be missing in two hours?

445
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,380
I don't know, Chloe.

446
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,510
I'm just telling you what it says here. Should I run it?

447
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,890
No, we have to do it up here.

448
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,100
Then why did you send it down here in the first place?

449
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,320
It was Edgar's executive decision.

450
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Should I give it to you?

451
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,620
No, I'm the primary tactical in a trade for Jack.

452
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,620
Give it to Edgar.

453
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
He said he's too busy.

454
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,130
Just run it through county and get it to him.

455
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,130
Okay.

456
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,200
Edgar

457
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,710
What?

458
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,000
Meg found something in the hourly.

459
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,090
I need you to look at it.

460
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,300
Can't Meg do it?

461
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
I'm preparing for this briefing.

462
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,100
No, it's the job of the lead tactical.

463
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,020
Isn't that what you think you are?

464
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,520
I don't need your sarcasm, okay?

465
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
I'll take care of it.

466
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,530
Fantastic.

467
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,010
Hey. Is this briefing about the trade for Jack?

468
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,840
Yeah. Marwan us called again.

469
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,010
Has a decision been made whether to go through with it or not?

470
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,640
- No. That's going to be decided in this meeting.  - By whom

471
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,520
Division.

472
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,820
Look, they sent someone down to run point.

473
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,030
Is Division thinking about not going through with this exchange?

474
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,620
Honestly, it could go either way.

475
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,910
Look, I don't need to tell you that Jack would want us to do what's best for the operation and the country, 

476
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,010
not what's best for him.

477
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,510
I know.

478
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,220
All right. I'll let you know what's going on as soon as I can.

479
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,230
All right. Thanks, Tony.

480
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,700
Were you able to get anything out of behrooz?

481
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,540
I don't think he knows anything but Curtis is still trying.

482
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,210
Okay.

483
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,210
Bill,

484
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,130
are we up to speed?

485
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,140
Yeah, I got briefed on the way here.

486
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,350
All right, everyone, listen up.

487
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,730
This is Bill Buchanan from Division.

488
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,310
He'll be overseeing the operation.

489
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,440
All department heads run everything through him.

490
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,240
Bill.

491
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,960
In less than half an hour, Habib marwan wants to make an exchange at the Union conduit dam;

492
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,920
behrooz araz for Jack bauer.

493
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,510
Now, before we decide whether or not to go forward,

494
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,510
I need to know a few things.

495
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,810
Why does marwan want the boy?

496
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,520
What's his value?

497
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,820
We were unable to find any evidence that behrooz had any critical information.

498
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,740
Did you push him?

499
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,910
Yeah.

500
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,200
I don't think the kid knows anything.

501
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Who's doing backgrounds?

502
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,700
Me.

503
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,210
There's nothing that specifically ties these two people together.

504
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,710
The parents, yes, behrooz, no.

505
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,430
Could behrooz have had something implanted in his body, 

506
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,010
something neither he or his parents knew about?

507
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,850
No.

508
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,350
We had him scanned when he was brought in.

509
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,350
Did you do an mri?

510
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,360
Yeah.

511
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,030
I don't like giving something up unless I know its value.

512
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,740
Let's talk about what happens If we don't agree to the exchange.

513
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,540
We don't get Jack bauer back, for one thing.

514
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,290
That can't be the deciding Factor here.

515
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,090
Well, most importantly, 

516
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,720
If we don't go through with this exchange, we May be lose an opportunity to trap marwan.

517
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,810
Marwan has to know that's what we're thinking.

518
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,820
The chances of him actually being in prison at the exchange are small.

519
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,320
I agree, but we could put a tracer on behrooz.

520
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,740
He might lead us to marwan.

521
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,910
You tried to Trace Dina araz and Jack an hour ago.

522
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,040
They grabbed Jack and killed Dina.

523
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,210
We'll take a different approach.

524
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,630
Use tracers, two of them.

525
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,930
One for marwan to find, the other subcutaneous.

526
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
There's no guarantee he won't find that one, too.

527
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,640
No, Sir, there are no guarantees, period.

528
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,440
But the fact is we have no viable leads on marwan.

529
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,740
We have to run with every chance we get.

530
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,460
Have tactical finish up the profiles in five minutes.

531
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,260
Let's get field teams on their way to the dam now.

532
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,800
How do you want to approach the site?

533
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,230
We'll figure that out when marwan calls back with the details of the exchange.

534
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,610
Go.

535
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,710
yeah.

536
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,130
What's your status?

537
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,130
I should be airborne in 30 minutes.

538
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
Very well.

539
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Get bauer.

540
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,230
No, we have to have the satellite in position, 

541
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,520
before the exchange takes the place.

542
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Edgar, Chloe wants you to take a look at this when you have the time.

543
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,040
Hang on. Let me write that down.

544
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Just put that down.

545
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,130
Thank you.

546
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,630
Yeah, okay, got it.

547
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,030
Mrs. Raines?

548
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,540
The doctor wanted me to tell you that your husband should be out of surgery within the next hour.

549
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,750
How's it going?

550
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,330
That's all he said.

551
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,340
Thank you.

552
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,480
Audrey, any word on Paul?

553
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,730
We still don't know yet.

554
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,030
Look, I thought you'd want to know we decided to go ahead with the exchange.

555
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,240
We're getting behrooz ready right now.

556
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,330
It's not going to be as simple as that, is it?

557
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,620
These things are never simple,

558
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,540
but, uh, 

559
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,130
if marwan really wants the kid, he's got no reason to Hurt Jack.

560
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,050
And If he doesn't, and it's just a trap?

561
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,430
We'll be prepared.

562
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,560
Our field agents will have the area fully covered.

563
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,150
Tony, will you be there?

564
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,150
No, I'm going to be running point from here.

565
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,160
Curtis will be on the ground.

566
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,170
Is the operational objective to get Jack?

567
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,180
No, it isn't.

568
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,240
Audrey...

569
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,830
We have to consider Jack expendable.

570
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,830
This whole thing's about creating an exposure point for marwan.

571
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,420
I know.

572
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,940
Thank you for being straight with me, Tony.

573
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,450
Look...

574
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
Jack's about the only friend I have left, so I'm going to do everything -

575
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,050
I can to keep him safe, all right?

576
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,350
Okay.

577
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,130
What are you doing?

578
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,140
Where are you taking me?

579
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,730
Habib marwan offered to exchange one of our operatives for you.

580
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,070
We accepted that offer.

581
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,150
What are you talking about?

582
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,570
What does he want from me?

583
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,740
We don't know.

584
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,750
But we'll be behind you every step of the way, and recover you as soon as possible.

585
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,750
Does my mother know about this?

586
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Yes.

587
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,350
You made a deal with her, to put us both in witness protection.

588
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,190
And we'll do everything to abide by that deal.

589
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,190
Then don't do this!

590
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,530
That's not an option.

591
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,450
Put this watch on.

592
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,340
No.

593
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,050
Go away from me.

594
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,050
These devices will help us track you.

595
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,940
And I give you my word I'll do everything in my power for you.

596
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Hang on, behrooz, this will stick.

597
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,040
it's a Micro tracker implanted under your skin.

598
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,550
You don't care about me, or your word.

599
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,850
You're just using me!

600
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,780
Let's go.

601
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,250
Edgar, I need you to sterilize a video feed to Curtis's Van.

602
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,250
Tony, I'm stacked up.

603
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,130
I got teams that need tactical uploads.

604
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,850
These hourlies need to be looked at.

605
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,260
They're 30 minutes past due.

606
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,770
And now I got to put video together?

607
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,770
Video's a priority.

608
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,440
I'll take care of the uploads.

609
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
What about the hourlies?

610
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Get on it as soon as the Link's in place.

611
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,680
Is that tracker working?

612
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,770
The red Dot is the decoy.

613
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,980
When they find the watch and remove it, we can still Trace the tracker in the back of his neck.

614
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:14,690
All right.

615
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,070
Edgar, make sure all cellular stations in that area are put on auto-trace.

616
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,240
Got it.

617
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,250
When our vehicles get within two miles of the dam on the West, have them hold.

618
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,260
Nobody goes into that area until we hear from marwan again.

619
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,140
Castle and his team will be there as soon as possible.

620
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,050
Behrooz is on his way.

621
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,140
The tracer's in place.

622
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,940
We don't have time to send in sweep teams, make sure it's not a trap.

623
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,070
We don't have a choice.

624
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,360
CTU, Edgar Stiles.

625
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,240
This is marwan.

626
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,160
Get dessler.

627
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Miss dessler, it's marwan.

628
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,550
This is dessler.

629
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,550
I'm going to give you final instructions now.

630
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,560
Make sure you follow them explicitly.

631
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,190
Are you ready?

632
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,690
Go ahead.

633
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,690
How are you transporting behrooz?

634
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,700
In one of our tactical vehicles.

635
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,490
Good.

636
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,870
Now...

637
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,450
Approach Via the frontage road.

638
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,050
Pull up by the back gate of the dam and have behrooz get out by himself 

639
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,050
and walk toward the gate.

640
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,640
A Van will be there to pick him up.

641
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
What about Jack bauer?

642
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,640
He'll be in the Van.

643
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,780
That doesn't work for me.

644
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,950
I want to see Jack before I give up behrooz.

645
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,240
That's acceptable.

646
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,370
And I want him unharmed.

647
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,380
Your boy scout is just fine.

648
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,670
Okay.

649
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,550
Remember, behrooz gets out by himself.

650
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,390
If any of your agents interfere, bauer dies.

651
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,770
Understood.

652
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,690
Don't be late.

653
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,360
Our vehicle's five minutes away.

654
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Then we'll see you in five minutes.

655
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
That should keep them busy.

656
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,540
What do you want to do about bauer?

657
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,470
As soon as we have behrooz...

658
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,470
We kill bauer.

659
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,770
Who's going to protect me?

660
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,060
We are.

661
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,070
That's why we put trackers on you.

662
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,660
You don't think marwan will find them?

663
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,870
He will.

664
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,870
Hopefully, it won't come to that, behrooz.

665
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,670
What does that mean?

666
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,680
We're gonna have the area surrounded.

667
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,470
We will protect you.

668
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,390
Why would you protect me?

669
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,900
I'm nothing to you people.

670
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
You think I'm a terrorist.

671
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,780
I don't believe you are.

672
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,000
If marwan is going to be there, 

673
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,710
why don't you just grab him when we get there?

674
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,720
He's probably not going to be there.

675
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,760
We needyou to lead us to him.

676
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,270
Oh, God.

677
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,140
It's going to be all right.

678
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,150
It's not!

679
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,580
I'm in position.

680
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
Does CTU have anyone there yet?

681
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,670
No, but Rashid has spotted vehicles at the edge of the access road.

682
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,680
He thinks that it might be them.

683
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Okay.

684
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,560
Wait until the exchange.

685
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Then I'll give you the word to take out bauer.

686
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,690
All right.

687
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,580
Once the trade is made, how much longer do we need to keep ctu distracted?

688
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,580
Ideally, until we hit the target.

689
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,210
In any event, as long as possible.

690
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,590
And what should my men do with behrooz once we have him?

691
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,850
I haven't decided yet.

692
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,870
yes.

693
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,880
They're here.

694
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,000
Good.

695
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,800
Send in the Van.

696
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,090
I don't want to do this.

697
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,890
Please. I'm afraid.

698
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,560
I told you, behrooz, we'll be behind you every step of the way.

699
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,270
What good will that do If he wants me dead?

700
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,570
He's not going through all of this just so that he can kill you.

701
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,090
All right, the Van's here.

702
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,290
Come on.

703
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,300
All right, I see Jack.

704
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,590
This might be all we're gonna get.

705
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,800
We could converge on them now.

706
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,890
Edgar.

707
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,100
Is there any indication that marwan has other personnel or vehicles in the area?

708
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,060
No. Just a Van.

709
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Marwan's not gonna be there.

710
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,370
If we close in now, they could take the Van out themselves.

711
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
We proceed.

712
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,090
Curtis, it's a go.

713
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,170
All right.

714
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,180
I'm sending behrooz.

715
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,270
Go ahead

716
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,270
It's all right.

717
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,990
Go.

718
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,080
Is my mother in the Van?

719
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,580
She was working with you. Where is she?

720
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,170
I don't know.

721
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,170
I don't want to die.

722
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,390
We've got behrooz, and I've got bauer in my sights.

723
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,770
Take him out.

724
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,380
I got their sniper.

725
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,380
Let's move out.

726
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,230
Why'd you give them the kid?

727
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,230
It's okay. He's been double-tagged.

728
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,900
We're tracking him.

729
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,150
All right, you two, secure the area.

730
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,580
You two, let's go.

731
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,100
Almeida.

732
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,390
Tony, it's Jack.

733
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,900
I got Buchanan and Michelle here.

734
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
I'm putting you on speaker.

735
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Okay.

736
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,490
You okay?

737
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,110
Yeah, I'm fine.

738
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,910
Look, Tony, I need you to pick up a phone matrix within a 20-Mile radius of the dam.

739
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,710
What are you thinking?

740
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,800
I managed to short-circuit some phone lines in the building that I was being held.

741
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,310
Look, If you can find two Service obstructions at the same coordinates, we can get to marwan.

742
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,520
I'm opening up an interface with the phone company right now.

743
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,810
Tony, we don't have a lot of time.

744
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,820
Marwan was at the building when they moved me, but he's not gonna stay there long.

745
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,570
We have tactical teams ready to go.

746
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,490
Once we get a location, I'll reposition for an assault.

747
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,660
Okay, I know the layout.

748
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,370
I'll run point.

749
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,380
Copy that.

750
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,090
The Van's heading West on center.

751
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,880
Both trackers are registering so far.

752
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,590
Good.

753
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,810
Let me know If anything changes.

754
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,810
Okay, I will.

755
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,610
Marwan.

756
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,410
We have the boy.

757
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:40,080
I know they will have placed tracking devices on him.

758
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,420
Find them.

759
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,000
We're looking for them now.

760
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,010
When you've destroyed them, report back to me.

761
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,510
Very well.

762
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,030
where is my mother?

763
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,990
Your mother is dead.

764
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,290
No.

765
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,590
I don't believe you.

766
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,910
what are you going to do to me?

767
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,910
No! No!

768
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,220
Curtis.

769
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,090
We lost one of the tags.

770
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,300
They found the decoy.

771
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,810
How's the injected device looking?

772
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,810
Still tracking.

773
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,320
Wait.

774
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
No, it's not.

775
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,530
They must have found it.

776
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,790
Damn it. Can you get me a visual on the Van?

777
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,790
Hold on.

778
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,100
yeah, Chloe.

779
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,320
We need a satellite plugged into the tactical Server.

780
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,990
Chloe, I got something you should see.

781
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,780
Okay, I'll get to it.

782
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,500
Right now we need that satellite to find behrooz araz before they kill him.

783
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,630
I'm on it.

784
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,980
We have a location from the phone company.

785
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,700
I repeat, we have the location where marwan was holding Jack.

786
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,290
Edgar, download these coordinates to tactical right now.

787
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,710
Our window is closing.

788
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,800
we will only have this one opportunity.

789
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,720
You got to get it into the air right now.

790
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,520
No problem.

791
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
I am ready and on the move.

792
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


793
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,480
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail.

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,650
Just like everything else you've tried today.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Almost 40 dead in a train crash,

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,080
many more near the San Gabriel Island Nuclear Plant.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,770
We managed to stop the other 103 power plants from melting down.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,690
That's what America will remember... that we stopped you.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,640
No, this country will forever be afraid 

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,640
to let their leaders appear in public.

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,290
For all the hatred that you have for this country,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,730
you don't understand it very well.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,000
Marwan...

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,200
The police report file has been distributed.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,080
In the next few minutes, CTU will be alerted that

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,500
the military pilot and his family are missing.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,660
What do you think we should do?

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,200
We have to make sure CTU

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,160
is too busy to realize its significance.

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,920
Jack Bauer is alive and in my custody.

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,040
I will return him to you unharmed

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,750
in exchange for Behrooz Araz.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,300
This is Bill Buchanan from Division.

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,470
He'll be overseeing the operation.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,120
Let's talk about what happens

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,610
if we don't agree to the exchange.

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,940
We don't get Jack Bauer back, for one thing.

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,850
That can't be the deciding factor here.

27
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,450
Well, most importantly,

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,480
if we don't go through with this exchange,

29
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,150
we may lose an oportunity to trap Marwan.

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,960
Is my mother in the van?

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,260
She was working with you. Where is she?

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,070
- I don't know.  - I don't want to die.

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,940
The sniper's down! Let's move out!

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,740
Why do you give them the kid?!

35
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,780
It's okay, he's been double tagged.

36
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,500
We'll be tracking him.

37
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,550
I managed to short-circuit the phone lines

38
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,940
in the building that I was being held.

39
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,430
If you can find two service obstructions

40
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,240
at the same coordinates, we can get to Marwan.

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,990
We have a location where Marwan was holding Jack.

42
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,030
Yes?

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,670
There'a problem.

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,730
Just as I was about to do a preflight check,

45
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,930
they grounded the plane.

46
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,460
Resolve this now.

47
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,090
Did you make your report to the chief mechanical officer?

48
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,020
I was just about to head over there right now.

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,990
Don't let me hold you up.

50
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,390
It was just a false alarm.

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,040
All right.

52
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,900
I'll clear it for takeoff.

53
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,450
We placed multiple trackers on Behrooz Araz,

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,250
but those are no longer transmitting,

55
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,820
which means that Marwan's men found and destroyed them.

56
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,150
Are you close to finding Marwan?

57
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,390
We may be, sir.

58
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,920
Jack Bauer managed to tag the location

59
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,490
where he was being held.

60
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,090
We're preparing to mount a raid on that location as we speak.

61
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,650
I want Marwan found... now.

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,150
I've asked Secret Service to secure a landing site

63
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,620
so I can be on the ground to address the nation

64
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,190
before the 11:00 news.

65
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,920
Sir, we believe that you're safer in the air right now.

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,890
I have been flying for 20 hours.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,960
The American people need to hear from me now, not tomorrow.

68
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,790
Then may I like to suggest you do it from Air Force One?

69
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,060
It may not be optimal,

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,860
but at least you'll get your message across.

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,320
I appreciate your concerns, 

72
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,220
but I'm going to give my speech when I get to Los Angeles.

73
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,660
I'll inform the press corp,

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,790
give them enough time to notify their outlets.

75
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,320
Yes, Mr. President.

76
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,220
Just make sure I'm briefed on Bauer's progress

77
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,560
before I go on the air.

78
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,520
Of course.

79
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,860
What's Jack's status?

80
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,760
His team just arrived at Marwan's location.

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,460
They should be in place in a few minutes.

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,090
CTU Com.

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,360
This is Bauer.

84
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,690
Strike teams are moving into final positions.

85
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
We're about five minutes out.

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,290
How are you on your end?

87
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,460
We're coordinating backup teams, we have building plans on line.

88
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,890
- Chloe?  - Yeah, it's me.

89
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,660
- Michelle brought me back in.  - Good.

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,590
Are the satellites in position?

91
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,160
Yes. We've been monitoring the area

92
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,060
for the past five minutes, but there's been no activity.

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,720
How's Paul Raines doing? Is he still in surgery?

94
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,190
Uh, no, he just got out.

95
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
Chloe, I'm glad to have you back.

96
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,820
We're going to need your help. Look, is Audrey there?

97
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,360
I think so.

98
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,320
Let me speak to her.

99
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,420
Hold on.

100
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,360
Hello.

101
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,220
Audrey, I have Jack on the line.

102
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,520
Are you there?

103
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,560
Yeah, I'm here.

104
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,320
Hold for Jack.

105
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,820
Okay.

106
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,120
Audrey?

107
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,490
Jack... you okay?

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah, I'm fine. How's Paul doing?

109
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,660
They just finished operating,

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
they said he's going to make it.

111
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,860
I'm waiting to talk to the doctors.

112
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,360
Good. I'm glad.

113
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,120
Look, Audrey, I know we have to talk about how

114
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,190
I handled everything with Paul.

115
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,360
Yeah, we do.

116
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,660
It's just...

117
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,390
It's really hard right now.

118
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,920
Yeah, I... I understand.

119
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,020
Are you still out in the field?

120
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,190
Yeah. We're getting ready to move on Marwan.

121
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,690
Be careful.

122
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,490
Yeah, I'll call you as soon as it's done.

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,660
Yeah... right.

124
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,290
I just got off the phone with DOD.

125
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
They want to know what our status is.

126
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,190
Jack's team has been deployed to Marwan's location.

127
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,790
He should begin the assault in any minute.

128
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,260
Did you get a read on how many hostiles are inside?

129
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,090
Based on the infrared scan, we counted eight.

130
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,990
Did we pick up voice transmission

131
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,820
that could indicate that one of them is Marwan?

132
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,820
No, but we know he was there 25 minutes ago

133
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,020
when Jack left the building.

134
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,060
If the information on that hard drive

135
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,520
is discovered by the Americans,

136
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,460
it will jeopardize the next phase of our plan.

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,160
Well, it's not here.

138
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,990
No, you haven't looked hard enough.

139
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,920
I've been searching for almost an hour.

140
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,490
Aziz told one of his men he hid a backup copy

141
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,090
of those files in his apartment.

142
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,390
Well, why didn't Aziz tell you where he hid it?

143
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,860
Because he was killed before he could tell me.

144
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,520
Look, Anderson shared this apartment with Aziz.

145
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,360
Maybe Anderson knows where the hard drive is.

146
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,420
Keep looking. I'll try to contact him.

147
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,590
Bravo three-niner in the air, heading 55-2.

148
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,420
Roger, Bravo three-niner, you are cleared for 3-5 thousand feet.

149
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,890
Bravo three-niner, ascending to 3-5 thousand feet.

150
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,860
I'm in the air.

151
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,160
I should reach the target in 45 minutes.

152
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,190
We have a problem.

153
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,620
What kind of problem?

154
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,320
Aziz, he hid a backup copy of his files

155
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,160
in your apartment on hard drive.

156
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,060
We haven't been able to find it.

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Ask Aziz.

158
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,590
Aziz is dead.

159
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,320
I don't know about a hard drive.

160
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,690
You have no idea where he might have kept it?

161
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,860
If I knew where it was, I'd tell you.

162
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,060
I'm not trying to get myself killed.

163
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,260
I'll get back to you.

164
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,960
Okay, in order to flush Marwan out,

165
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,220
I want you to lead your men down the main corridor.

166
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,860
He'll try to escape through the left flank.

167
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,060
That's where I'll find him.

168
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
Tac's team's ready to go in on your word.

169
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,990
Have they set the charges on the door?

170
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,990
- Yes.  - Gentlemen, we are a go.

171
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,860
We've got a green light.

172
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,820
Teams A and B, move into position.

173
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,620
All teams, move in on target.

174
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,960
Prepare to ignite charges on my mark.

175
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,790
Three, two, one.

176
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,990
Blow the door!

177
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,960
Go! Go! Move! Move! Move!

178
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,390
Delete the files! Delete everything!

179
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
Fire! Let's go! Let's go!

180
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,200
Get out of here!

181
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,920
Hold your fire!

182
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,660
Clear!

183
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,880
Marwan's not here. Notify the perimeter.

184
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,350
Team One and Team Two, come in.

185
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,970
Marwan is not in the building. Maintain your perimeter.

186
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,070
Come on!

187
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,340
I can't stop this thing from deleting.

188
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,980
This doesn't make sense.

189
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,390
This room's hot. Get your men out of here!

190
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,790
Get your men out of here now!

191
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,740
Jack, what's happening?

192
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,040
What's going on over there?

193
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,220
- You OK?  - Yeah, I think so.

194
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,480
Check your men!

195
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,270
Jack, if you can hear me, respond!

196
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,780
Michelle, Marwan's escaped.

197
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,950
He just blew up the hard drives to all his computers.

198
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,920
He's trying to cover his tracks.

199
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm going off comin'.

200
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,600
If you want me I'm gona be on my cell.

201
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,160
Chloe, Get data forensics in there now,

202
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,730
and start a hard target search for Marwan.

203
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,020
Get me a medic! Medic!

204
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,470
You can't stop it

205
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,650
Stop what?

206
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,040
The course you'll be on

207
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,460
What's going to happen within the hour?

208
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,410
What's going to happen within the hour?

209
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,890
Mrs. Raines?

210
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,390
Yes.

211
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,180
Your husband is in Recovery.

212
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,780
How is he?

213
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,210
He's stable, but one of the bullets

214
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,050
did some damage to his spine.

215
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,550
Right now he's paralyzed from the waist down.

216
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,350
Is it permanent... ?

217
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,580
It's too early to tell.

218
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,110
That'll take weeks, maybe months,

219
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,780
before we fully understand the extent

220
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,180
of damage to his spine.

221
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,480
So it's possible he could regain the use of his legs.

222
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,850
It's possible, yes.

223
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,750
But not likely.

224
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,910
Again, it's too early to tell.

225
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
We could go over the details later,

226
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,980
but I'd be lying to you if I told you I was optimistic.

227
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,780
A lot depends on his attitude,

228
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,850
his support system... emotional as well as medical.

229
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,710
Does he know?

230
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,550
Yes. I just told him.

231
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,050
I'm sure he'd like to see you.

232
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,100
Thank you.

233
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,280
Excuse me, can you give us a minute?

234
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,650
Oh, no, don't even think of feeling sorry for me.

235
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,580
Whatever they say, I'm going to walk again.

236
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,750
I know you will.

237
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,110
So, where's Jack?

238
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,050
He's still out in the field.

239
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,750
He called a little while ago,

240
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,280
wanted to know how you're doing.

241
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,710
He knows that bullet was meant for him.

242
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,050
I was just trying to push him out of the way,

243
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,150
I didn't expect to get shot myself.

244
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,010
What you did was very, very brave, Paul.

245
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,380
LAPD's widening their search perimeter,

246
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,250
but so far they're coming up empty.

247
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,350
Jack said something might happen within the hour.

248
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,450
If we don't find Marwan...

249
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,780
We're going to find him.

250
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,310
Did you secure Marwan yet?

251
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,550
No. He must've slipped through the perimeter.

252
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,210
How the hell could you let that happen?

253
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,580
Doesn't matter how it happened.

254
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,950
What matters is that he's gone

255
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,950
and we're doing everything we can to find him.

256
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,150
What exactly are you doing to find him?

257
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,280
We've widened the perimeter, set up a search grid.

258
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,710
State police and LAPD are conducting a sweep.

259
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,910
Jack's on line two.

260
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,250
He says he's got something.

261
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,880
Put him on the speaker.

262
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,080
Jack, it's Michelle.

263
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,350
You're also on with Tony and Bill Buchanan from Division.

264
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,810
Okay, look, Marwan had an area set up for forging documents.

265
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,380
Some of them made it through the explosion.

266
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,480
We managed to secure a number of names and faces.

267
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,410
Agent Castle is uploading them to your server now.

268
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,510
I want you to cross-reference them with the watch lists.

269
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,080
We'll get on it right away.

270
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,610
Okay, get back to me if you've got a match.

271
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,250
Edgar...

272
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,280
I'm initializing the facial recognition software now.

273
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,450
Good.

274
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,610
Michelle...

275
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,310
Listen, I'm sorry if I snapped.

276
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,310
It's okay.

277
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,550
We're all under a lot of pressure.

278
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,110
You holding up?

279
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,380
Fine.

280
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,080
Edgar, how's that uplink?

281
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,180
Coming up.

282
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,910
Chloe, how long has Buchanan beenat Division?

283
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,610
I don't know.

284
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,010
It took them a while to fill Chapelle's position. 6 months?

285
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,080
Where he was before that?

286
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,950
Seattle, I think.

287
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,710
Seattle?

288
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,750
Yeah, that's where Michelle was posted

289
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,950
while you were in jail, right?

290
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,910
Yeah.

291
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,910
Thanks.

292
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,380
Got a match.

293
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,410
This is Bauer.

294
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,610
Jack, we have got a match on one of those photos.

295
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,380
He's on the FBI's watch list. His name is Mitch Anderson.

296
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,680
What do we got on him?

297
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,550
Ex-military, arrested for drug possession.

298
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,880
Served time in military prison,

299
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,110
was dishonorably discharged four years ago.

300
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,450
Since then he's been hired as a mercenary

301
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,950
in a number of conflicts around the world,

302
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,380
came back to the U.S. about a year ago.

303
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,110
Is he under active investigation?

304
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,280
He was moved up the list when we raised the alert,

305
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,850
but he wasn't made a priority.

306
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,950
The Bureau sent an agent over to check out his apartment.

307
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,350
Has the agent checked back in yet?

308
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,910
They may still be in transit.

309
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,880
Okay, I want you to get me an address on Anderson.

310
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,780
Start digging up as much information as you can.

311
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,810
And get me a contact number for the FBI agent.

312
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,050
I'm on it.

313
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,110
FBI.

314
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,650
I'm looking for Mitch Anderson.

315
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,810
This FBI Agent Drake. Please open the door.

316
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,650
Agent Drake.

317
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,110
Hi, my name is Jack Bauer. I'm working with CTU.

318
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm looking for a man named Mitch Anderson.

319
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,910
Your office said you were investigating him.

320
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
I just got to his apartment a few minutes ago.

321
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,310
What do you mean, he's not there?

322
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,410
No. Why is CTU involved?

323
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,250
Is there new information about Anderson?

324
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,280
We have evidence connecting him to a man named Habib Marwan.

325
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,510
Marwan's been responsible

326
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,480
for all the terrorist activity earlier today.

327
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,480
We also have reason to believe

328
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,350
he's planning another attack.

329
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,980
Well, how is Anderson involved?

330
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,680
I'll advise you when I get there.

331
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,850
How far away are you?

332
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,250
About ten minutes out.

333
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,210
I'll be here.

334
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,550
Thank you.

335
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,890
Yes?

336
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,460
We had a slight delay.

337
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,030
I'm heading over there now.

338
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,390
What about Anderson?

339
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,760
He's in the air, on his way to the target.

340
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,230
Everything's on schedule.

341
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,790
Are your people in place?

342
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,830
Yes. We're ready to deploy.

343
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,090
Good. I'll see you when we arrive.

344
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,960
Sorry, but this just isn't cutting it.

345
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,590
The tone is all wrong.

346
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,860
Sir, maybe I could give the speechwriters

347
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,360
a clearer idea of what you want.

348
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,290
This is one of the most traumatic days

349
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,130
in the history of this country.

350
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,830
What I want is a speech that is equal to the occasion.

351
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,760
Give me a few minutes, will you, Robert?

352
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,590
Let me... think about this a little while longer.

353
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,890
Of course, Mr. President.

354
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,090
Oh, and, Robert, ask my son to step in, will you?

355
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,830
Yes, sir.

356
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,030
Dad?

357
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,630
Well, a quick trip to Mexico, a low-key state visit,

358
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,090
and then we'd finally have some time to spend together.

359
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,490
It's okay. The, uh, press corp's been keeping me entertained.

360
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,590
You know, ever since your mother died,

361
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,360
I promised myself I'd be there for you.

362
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,890
You've been doing what you had to do.

363
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,430
I could, uh, use your help right about now.

364
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,960
I'm going to be addressing the nation in about one hour,

365
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,730
and I still don't have a speech that I'm happy with.

366
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,360
I'm no speechwriter.

367
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,300
No, I know.

368
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,730
But you've got a level head,

369
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,830
and you're about the most decent person I know.

370
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,690
As far as I'm concerned,

371
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,260
you represent the very best this country has to offer.

372
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,960
So... what do you want to hear the president say 

373
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,790
when he addresses you tonight?

374
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,260
The truth.

375
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,490
We've been attacked by terrorists.

376
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,490
Americans are dead.

377
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,460
The man responsible is still at large,

378
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,060
and we are by no means certain

379
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,530
that we can catch him before he strikes again.

380
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,830
What happened earlier...

381
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,260
may be nothing compared to what happens next.

382
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,660
That's the truth, Kevin.

383
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,360
Is that what you think I should say?

384
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,360
I don't know.

385
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,030
Neither do I.

386
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,930
But the fact remains... I have to say something.

387
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,830
Y... You want me to help you figure it out?

388
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,030
Absolutely.

389
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,860
Agent Drake?

390
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,590
Agent Drake?

391
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,930
Drop the weapon!

392
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,160
Drop the weapon now!

393
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,960
- Are you Agent Bauer?  - Yes!

394
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,160
Now, holster your weapon!

395
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,880
- I need to se your I.D.  - I don't have identification...

396
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,330
I'm working with CTU on a provisional basis.

397
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,730
I talked to you ten minutes ago.

398
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,290
Call Division and confirm.

399
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,930
Agent Drake, just take it easy.

400
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,490
He's with me.

401
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,060
Agent Hart, CTU.

402
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,830
Now, I'm gonna holster my gun.

403
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,390
I'm gonna show you my credentials.

404
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,590
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,130
With everything that happened today,

406
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,330
you can't be too careful.

407
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,660
I understand.

408
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,760
Agent Bauer, we just intercepted a call

409
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,130
indicating that Anderson was in possession

410
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,130
of computer files that could tell us Marwan's next target.

411
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,560
What's the source of the intercepted call?

412
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,030
I'm still waiting for the details.

413
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,790
Did you find the apartment in this condition?

414
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,360
No. My ASAC thinks that Anderson

415
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,760
may have hidden a backup copy of the files here.

416
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,730
I was trying to find it.

417
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,790
Right now Anderson's our only lead.

418
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,360
We're gonna stay here and help you finish the job.

419
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,660
Do a canvass. We'll take upstairs.

420
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,630
Where are you?

421
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,230
I'm almost in position.

422
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,360
What's the problem?

423
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,390
Is my cover in place?

424
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,860
I've told you before... yes.

425
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,890
You'll be 100% safe.

426
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,930
Marwan, they have to believe I'm dead.

427
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,060
They will. My people have taken care of this.

428
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,560
They better.

429
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,160
Because once this is done,

430
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,990
the entire world is gonna be looking for me.

431
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,060
Mhmm. I understand.

432
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,930
Yeah, I'll tell him.

433
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,630
Thanks, Ruben.

434
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,400
- Edgar.  - Yeah?

435
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,330
I have some bad news.

436
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,160
Do you want me to tell you here or somewhere private?

437
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,530
- What?  - I just got off the phone with Ruben Weiss from OSHA,

438
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,830
and he said they're not gonna be able to get in the area

439
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,960
where your mother died for a few weeks, maybe months.

440
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,400
Why not?

441
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,660
Think about it.

442
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,990
Half-life? Radiation?

443
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,430
What does that mean?

444
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,790
Well, he didn't spell it out, but I think that means

445
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,630
you're gonna have to have your funeral

446
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,560
without the body... of your mother

447
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,530
I can't deal with this right now, Chloe.

448
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,530
Michelle needs prioritized lists for Marwan's pursuit plan.

449
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,400
Oh.

450
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,960
Okay, good.

451
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,990
Do you want me to do that for you?

452
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,830
No.

453
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,560
LAPD's locked down the area where Marwan was last seen.

454
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,330
I need you to review the search grid.

455
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,330
- All right.  - Okay, thanks.

456
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,890
Michelle. When were you planning on telling me?

457
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,790
About what?

458
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,890
About you and Buchanan.

459
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,560
Never. Because it's none of your business.

460
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,300
Michelle.

461
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,890
Before you worked with him at Division, you worked with him in Seattle

462
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,760
on Homeland Security restructuring, right?

463
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,200
- Yeah.  - We were still married then.

464
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,430
Legally, yes.

465
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,730
Did you sleep with him while we were married?

466
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,930
No.

467
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,430
I didn't.

468
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,560
But you are now.

469
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,090
Like I said, it's none of your business.

470
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,760
Edgar, where are those updates?

471
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,530
Coming right up.

472
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,660
Edgar, what are you doing?

473
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,300
- Miss Dessler.  - Edgar, wait.

474
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,430
- What?  - Wait, before you turn that in,

475
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,560
I made a mistake... I used Row-Major format

476
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,890
instead of Column-Major.

477
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,460
Why would you do that, Chloe?

478
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,200
You know Row-Major isn't compatible with our software.

479
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,790
It'll bring all our processors to a crawl.

480
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,990
I know. It was a mistake.

481
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,460
I thought it was going to Division.

482
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,660
Well, fix it.

483
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,990
Chloe, that was my mistake.

484
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,660
Why'd you cover for me?

485
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,630
- You're welcome.  - You'd have had your job back

486
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,400
if you would've let me hand her the disk.

487
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,160
I thought you had a lot on your mind.

488
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,690
Agent Bauer?

489
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,160
Yeah?

490
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,930
I checked with the neighbors...

491
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,500
nobody's seen Mitch Anderson today.

492
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,500
Did you talk to the manager?

493
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,030
Yeah, Anderson kept to himself,

494
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,990
paid his rent on time... the ideal tenant.

495
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,760
Okay, thanks.

496
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,090
Agent Drake?

497
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,530
Yes?

498
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,400
Anderson was ex-military, dishonorably discharged.

499
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,330
This bag is from Vanguard Mills.

500
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,460
They manufacture medals for the armed forces.

501
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,990
There's a date stamp on it, three months old.

502
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,560
Anderson left the military four years ago.

503
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,890
You think he's currently posing as military.

504
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,600
It's a distinct possibility...

505
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,030
I want you to let your people know: we'll do the same.

506
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,630
Have this scanned and send it over to Chloe at CTU.

507
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,600
You got it.

508
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,600
This is Special Agent Drake.

509
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,830
Can you put me through to Dawson, please?

510
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,690
Thank you.

511
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,960
- CTU. Almeida.  - Tony, it's Jack.

512
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,660
We just found some evidence that indicates

513
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,400
that Anderson might be posing as military.

514
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,830
I want you to update the profiles, see if anything comes back.

515
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,990
All right, I'm on it.

516
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,260
Okay, thanks.

517
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,790
Yeah, this is Drake.

518
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,090
Listen, we just found credible evidence suggesting

519
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,430
that Anderson is disguised as military.

520
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,230
That's right.

521
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,360
Yes.

522
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,560
Fine.

523
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,930
Yes.

524
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,300
No, that's not a problem.

525
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,890
Good.

526
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,660
All right. Well, thanks.

527
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,730
I'll let you know if we find anything else.

528
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,960
Hey. I found something.

529
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,560
It's an external hard drive.

530
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,860
This is exactly what we're looking for.

531
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,860
That's good work.

532
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,530
Drop the weapon!

533
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,430
Come on.

534
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,160
Edgar Stiles.

535
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,830
Edgar, it's Jack. Where's Chloe?

536
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,090
She's busy doing a systems update.

537
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,830
Okay. I need you to tell Michelle and Tony

538
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,060
that the FBI agent that I met at Anderson's apartment

539
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,530
was an impostor working for Marwan.

540
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,530
I killed her, but not before she took out my backup.

541
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,530
CTU needs to send out a team,

542
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,890
lock down the apartment and initiate an investigation.

543
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,690
Do you want to tell them yourself?

544
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,230
No, you can tell them in a second.

545
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,660
Right now, I need you to help me pull some data off a hard drive.

546
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,400
The directory's locked. Hold on one second.

547
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,730
I'm going to put you on speakerphone.

548
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,730
Okay, go ahead.

549
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,990
Can you get into the root?

550
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,560
Yeah, but I can't open the files.

551
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,960
Okay, hold down tab and arrow

552
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,260
until the manufacturer's code appears.

553
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,160
Okay, I got it.

554
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,630
What are the last three digits on the part code?

555
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,690
R-Two-Five.

556
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,730
Escape out and enter pass code C-I-S-Eight-Three-R.

557
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,960
That should backdoor you into the files.

558
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,400
Oh, my God.

559
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,500
Jack, did it work?

560
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,630
Yeah, I'm in. I need to speak to Michelle and Tony now.

561
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,730
Hold on, I'll get 'em.

562
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,900
Jack's on the line.

563
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,830
Jack, what is it?

564
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,160
I pulled some data off a hard drive

565
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,890
that we found hidden in Anderson's apartment.

566
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,730
On it is a flight simulator and

567
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,530
full schematics to an F-117A Stealth fighter.

568
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,460
Anderson's an experienced pilot.

569
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,200
- I know.  - I also think he's posing as military.

570
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,030
I believe Mitch Anderson's trying to steal a Stealth fighter.

571
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,130
Almeida.

572
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,910
Tony, I'm on my way in.

573
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,970
Have you gotten anything from the airport?

574
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,610
Hang on, it's coming through.

575
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,470
Central Air Command reports that an F-117A Stealth fighter

576
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,640
took off on a scheduled mission about 40 minutes ago.

577
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,840
Now, the pilot did not call in on schedule.

578
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,470
That was about six minutes ago.

579
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,870
All attempts to contact that pilot have failed.

580
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,610
Okay, that's it.

581
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,070
We have to assume Anderson's flying that plane.

582
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,170
Yeah, I agree.

583
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,410
Is the aircraft armed?

584
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,610
Yeah, standard non-nuclear ordinance.

585
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,310
We're going to have to work up a list

586
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,640
of obvious possible targets.

587
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,170
Yeah. Right. I'm working that up right now.

588
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,970
Wait.

589
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,840
Air Force One is headed to L.A.

590
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,110
Jack, did you hear that?

591
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,710
Yeah, what's the ETA?

592
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,440
11:00 p.m.

593
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,810
Oh, my God.

594
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,440
They're going after the President.

595
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,870
I'll call Air Force One.

596
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,070
Tony, we don't have a lot of time. I need you to get me

597
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,210
the recall frequency for that plane's squadron.

598
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,370
And send Anderson's bio over to my screen.

599
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,510
Yeah, I'm on it.

600
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,210
Where's Buchanan?

601
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,840
He's in Tactical, talking directly with the military.

602
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,340
Tell him he's going to have to tell the Joint Chiefs of Staff

603
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,510
that we believe the likely target is 

604
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,410
President Keeler aboard Air Force One.

605
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,140
You really have been helpful, Kevin.

606
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,740
I think this speech strikes just the right note.

607
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,170
Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt.

608
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,070
It's Michelle Dessler at CTU.

609
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,940
She says it's urgent.

610
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,940
Yes, what is it, Ms. Dessler?

611
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,370
Mr. President, we have reason to believe that

612
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,410
a Stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist...

613
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,740
and is in your airspace as we speak.

614
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,610
This plane is due to land shortly,

615
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,740
and I'm about to address the country.

616
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,570
Just how sure are we about this?

617
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,670
It's a near certainty, Mr. President.

618
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,640
We've informed your pilot, and he's preparing

619
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,810
to combine evasive action with immediate descent.

620
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,470
You're cleared to land in Palm Springs.

621
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,210
I'm sure my escort fighters are perfectly capable

622
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,840
of protecting Air Force One.

623
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,740
Mr. President, this is a Stealth aircraft,

624
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,110
invisible to radar.

625
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,940
If he finds you, he may be on you

626
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,070
before your fighter escort can react.

627
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,710
What are the chances he'll find us?

628
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,340
We can't be sure, Mr. President.

629
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,010
But the radar signature of a 747 and four fighter planes

630
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,510
is unmistakable.

631
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,610
You're telling me that this stolen Stealth plane

632
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,870
will attempt to shoot me down?

633
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,410
It looks that way, Mr. President.

634
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,570
I see.

635
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,940
Dad...

636
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,070
It's going to be okay.

637
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,570
It seems our plane may come under attack.

638
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,140
We're going to take some precautions.

639
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,140
Get me the Vice President on the phone.

640
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,840
Yes, sir.

641
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,240
All right, Jack, it should be coming through right now.

642
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,970
Yeah, I've got it.

643
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,440
Not much to go on. Parents deceased.

644
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,370
He has a sister named Alicia. 

645
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,910
Looks like they might have lived together at the same address

646
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,840
for a number of years, so they might be close.

647
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,210
Any recent contact information?

648
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,110
No. Let me see if I can find that for you.

649
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,970
No, we don't have any time.

650
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,510
- Have you got the recall frequency?  - Yeah.

651
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,410
Get ready to patch me through to Anderson.

652
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,210
Copy that.

653
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,340
Air Force One is descending through 20,000 feet.

654
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,910
The fighters have formed a protective shield.

655
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,040
How long before it touches down?

656
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,870
Nine minutes.

657
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,910
And the fighters report no sign of Stealth aircraft?

658
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,910
Not yet.

659
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,940
Maybe it's not there.

660
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,770
It's there, we just can't see it.

661
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,140
We're being beaten by our own technology.

662
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,640
Jack, you're set.

663
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,040
When you hit your intercom button,

664
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,070
you'll be patched through to the Stealth fighter.

665
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,170
Copy that.

666
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:12,310
Mitch Anderson, can you hear me?

667
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,010
Captain Anderson, do you read me?

668
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,040
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm a federal agent.

669
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,370
We know who you are, we know what you're trying to do.

670
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,710
Sir, I know you can hear me.

671
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,910
Nothing you've done so far can't be undone.

672
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,310
All you have to do is change your vector

673
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,410
to heading one-one-five-southeast.

674
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,970
That'll put you on a fast track to Andrews Air Force Base.

675
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,240
Once you touch down, then we can discuss how you want to handle his.

676
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,170
Please just talk to me.

677
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,440
Explain to me what you're trying to do,

678
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,910
what you're trying to accomplish.

679
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,710
Why?

680
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,140
I've been going over your service record.

681
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,170
It's very impressive.

682
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,010
Graduated top of your class, Air Force Academy.

683
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,570
Highly decorated for your service in Desert Storm,

684
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,840
including Air Force Silver Star.

685
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,210
What happened to you?

686
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,910
Explain it to me.

687
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,210
Because what you're trying to do right now...

688
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:24,070
I don't think that's who you are.

689
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,370
I don't think that's how you want to be remembered.

690
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,940
If I go down, you have to stay the course.

691
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,510
Do you understand?

692
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,370
Mr. President, I'm... I'm sure it won't come to that.

693
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,410
Charles, you're the Vice President.

694
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,040
The nation will be relying on you.

695
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,970
If the worst happens,

696
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,970
think of me as a casualty of war.

697
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,470
Don't waste time.

698
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,510
Just pick up the torch and move forward.

699
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,010
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

700
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,470
Mr. President, we think CTU is in communication

701
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,370
with the pilot of the stolen aircraft.

702
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,140
Patch it through.

703
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,670
I've just been notified by the FBI 

704
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,910
that they've contacted your sister, Alicia.

705
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,970
They've advised her of what's happening.

706
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,240
She's scared.

707
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,810
She wants to talk to you.

708
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,810
All you have to do, Captain Anderson, is respond to me,

709
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,840
and I'll put her right through.

710
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,440
Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson?!

711
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,440
Chloe, I think we've been cut off.

712
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,710
Is there an override channel?

713
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,140
He's cut off all communication circuits.

714
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,770
I don't think there's anything we can do.

715
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,870
Damn it!

716
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,910
Dad...

717
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,470
I'm scared.

718
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,970
Oh, my God.

719
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,240
Was Air Force One just hit?

720
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,070
Was Air Force One just hit?!

721
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,710
Escort pilots report...

722
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,470
Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit

723
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,240
by an air-to-air missile.

724
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,910
Pieces are falling to the ground over the desert...

725
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


726
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,400
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,400
We have a problem. If the information on that hard drive is discovered by the Americans,

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,700
it'll jeopardize the next phase of our plan.

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,200
Well, it's not here.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,300
Keep looking.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,200
Agent Drake? Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon now!

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,500
Jack's on the line.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,600
Jack, what is it?

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,600
I pulled some data off a hard drive that we found hidden in Anderson's apartment.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,200
I believe Mitch Anderson's trying to steal a stealth fighter.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,100
Mr. President, we have reason to believe that a stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,800
- He's in your airspace as we speak.  - Just how sure are we about this?

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,760
It's a near-certainty, Mr. President. This is a stealth aircraft.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,500
If he finds you, he may be on you before your fighter escort can react.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,100
Mitch Anderson, we know who you are. We know what you're trying to do.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,600
Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson? Chloe, I think we've been cut off. Is there an override channel?

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,400
He's cut off all communication circuits. I don't think there's anything we can do.

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,100
Dad. I'm scared.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,300
Air Force One has been fired on. I repeat, Air Force One has been fired on.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,400
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Was Air Force One just hit? Was Air Force One just hit?!

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,100
Escort pilots report Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit by an air-to-air missile.

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,500
Pieces are falling to the ground over the desert.

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,800
The following takes place between 11:00 P.M. and 12:00 A.M.

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,800
This is Air Force One. We are declaring an emergency. Repeat, Air Force One is declaring an emergency.

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Copy, Air Force One. What is your condition? Over.

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,500
Extensive damage to the port side wing and fuse lines. 

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,000
We've lost our pressurization, losing fuel pressure. Low hydraulics. 

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,400
Chloe, are those the coordinates?

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Yeah. They're 20 knot of the miles northeast to the city of Indio.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Edgar. Contact local PD and EMS. Alert them of the situation with Air Force One.

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,900
On it.

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,000
Tony, do we have any CTU support teams in the area?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,600
The Las Vegas office has two satellites search and rescue teams available.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm gonna dispatch Air Force One's coordinates to all of the search and rescue teams

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,900
over in LA and Vegas so they can start for the landing site now.

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,700
Edgar, pull up satellite on the National Park. Pinpoint any possible landing scenarios.

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,200
Chloe, what's happening?

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
We've lost the signal. They're still moving fast and losing altitude.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,100
Change the frequency.

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,400
OK, I've got it.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,800
All engines are out.

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Going through 7500 and 210 knots.

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,300
Roger, 210 knots.

45
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,800
Chloe, are you still waiting coordinates?

46
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,700
Yeah, they're making a turn.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,700
Roger, I'm close to a stall. Yeah, I'm putting you down now.

48
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,800
Don't get redeployed, we are still hard and fast.

49
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,000
Air Traffic Control, this is CTU.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,700
We are sending EMS, Police and rescue teams to the site ASAP.

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,000
Copy that, CTU.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,500
This is Air Force One, descending through 5500, 169...

53
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Chloe, what's showing on radar?

54
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,000
Air Force One is down.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Air Force One? Air Force One, do you read? Air Force One is down.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,200
I just got a confirm of scattered ground flashes from DOD satellite.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,800
Edgar, bring that up.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
What's the status of Air Force One?

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's down.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,100
What's its crash signature like?

61
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,700
It was a rough landing, radio's down. We don't know if there are any survivors.

62
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,900
Match your coordinates to the satellite. Send it to all agencies.

63
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,700
Got it.

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,200
Anybody tried sub-channel com-sat?

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,000
No.

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,100
Secret Service has at least five personnel on board, all of them have private channels.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,000
Com-sat 3 operator.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,100
This is Jack Bauer. Login password: F-H-Ralfie-4.

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,000
Go ahead.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,600
I want you to flood all AF1 channels with an acknowledge signal.

71
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,550
Copy. This is com-sat 3 operator, calling AF1 channels 1 through 5,

72
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,500
please acknowledge. AF1 channels 1 through 5, please acknowledge.

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
This is channel 3.

74
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,400
Who's this?

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Peterson. We're down.

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,200
What is the status of the President?

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
I don't know. I can't move yet.

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,200
Agent Peterson, my name is Jack Bauer. I'm with CTU.

79
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,600
Rescue units are on route. What else can you tell me?

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,900
I see some bodies. I... I think we have some survivors.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,700
Mr. Vice President, I just received confirmation.

82
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,900
Air Force One sustained an indirect hit from an air-to-air missile fired from a stolen stealth fighter.

83
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,300
Is the President alive?

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,300
We don't know at this time.

85
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,800
When will we know?

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Hopefully within the next few minutes.

87
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:38,300
Charles, we've known each other for 15 years. If I can offer some advice?

88
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,500
Of course.

89
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,300
We all hope President Keeler is alive, but even if he is,

90
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,300
it's very likely he won't be in any shape to run the country.

91
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,500
You need to make arrangements to be sworn into office as soon as possible,

92
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,100
and the media should provide live coverage.

93
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,000
The American people need to be reassured that their leadership is intact.

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,900
It's good advice, Mike. I'll take it under consideration, but I don't wanna act prematurely.

95
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,800
I understand.

96
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,700
Well, we have to get to the White House. I've arranged for a security briefing with the Pentagon.

97
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,200
That's great.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
By now, you all know that Air Force One has been shot down.

99
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,300
The escort pilots following Air Force One managed to get a visual of the stealth fighter used to commit the act,

100
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,350
pilot engaged, then shot down the stealth. The status of the President is unclear at this time.

101
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,400
Rescue teams are minutes away. We'll know very soon.

102
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,300
The man responsible for what has transpired today, Habib Marwan, is still out there,

103
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,900
and most likely planning further attacks. I want every one of you to rededicate yourselves to finding Marwan.

104
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't want a single lead ignored or a shred of evidence missed.

105
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,900
Let's get back to work.

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,500
Michelle, let me talk to you.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,000
I want you to uplink all curtainlies to a station, so you and I can start working on a priority list.

108
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,900
We might not know exactly where Marwan is, but he has to be within a 15 mile radius...

109
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,400
Jack.

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,100
Jack. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I just got off the phone with the Secretary of Defense,

111
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,800
and right now there's a higher priority than finding Marwan.

112
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,400
What is it?

113
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,700
Recovering the Nuclear Football.

114
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,400
Didn't it go down with Air Force One?

115
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,900
Not exactly. The missile inflicted enough damage that the plane left a trail of debris as it went down.

116
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,000
A lot of things were sucked out, including the Football.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,100
There's a transponder embedded in the casing, so we know its exact location.

118
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, good, then the retrieval team should have no problem recovering it.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,600
The Secretary wants you to head up that team, Jack.

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,100
Why?

121
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,100
It's his top priority.

122
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,200
That case contains the codes and locations of out entire nuclear arsenal.

123
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,500
Nothing is more critical than getting it back, and as quickly as possible.

124
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,200
Fine.

125
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll organize your team, mobilize the units.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,900
Thanks.

127
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,600
What's the location of the Football?

128
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,800
Forty miles northeast of here, in the middle of the desert.

129
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Hey. Hey.

130
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,000
What's wrong? What else is happening?

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,400
Paul may have to go back into surgery. Apparently the bullet did more damage than they thought.

132
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,600
I keep thinking if I had handled things differently, if I had trusted him more, that...

134
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Audrey, you are not responsible for this.

135
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,000
I, and I alone, made the decision on how to handle Paul. If you wanna remain affective,

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,700
be able to do your job, you have to let it go.

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,300
Jack, that's your gift. You're able to block things out. I can't do that.

138
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,900
Jack, the chopper's waiting.

139
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,200
I have to change and get ready.

140
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,900
All right.

141
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,500
Honey.

142
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,600
What's wrong?

143
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,800
I don't know. Something woke me up. It sounded like some kind of an explosion or something.

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Explosion? Nearby?

145
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,900
I'm not sure.

146
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,100
It was probably just a bad dream.

147
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,300
Yeah.

148
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,600
You're still stressed, aren't you? I want you to try and forget about work, OK?

149
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,200
Just focus on what we came out here for...to relax,

150
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,900
and to make a baby.

151
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,700
Look.

152
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
What?

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,300
Watch your step.

154
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,100
Oh, my God.

155
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,500
Kelly.

156
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,900
What is it?

157
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,500
If the President is unable to fulfill his duties, Vice President Logan will have to assume office, at least on temporary basis.

158
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,700
Cabinet members will need to be briefed on the circumstances surrounding the crash.

159
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,500
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

160
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,300
Not all Cabinet members are equal. State and Defense need more detail than say, Aviculture and Treasury.

161
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,400
Yeah, I can handle it.

162
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
I just wanna make sure that the transition is smooth.

163
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,400
I understand, but uh... I do know what to do.

164
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,000
All right.

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,500
Tony.

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,600
I've noticed a little hostility on your part. If it's because of me and Michelle...

167
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,700
It's none of my business.

168
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,100
As far as the hostility goes, I can promise you. It's over with.

169
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,300
Whatever you say.

170
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:23,000
One more thing: I think the world of Michelle, love working with her.

171
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,500
Outside work, we never got off the ground,

172
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,100
she never said why but it didn't take a genius to figure it out. She cared about you.

173
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,600
If you ask me, she still does.

174
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,700
Mr. Buchanan, rescue teams are inside Air Force One.

175
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,300
We're picking up the live feed now.

176
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Go ahead. Check to see if he's alive.

177
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
She's dead too.

178
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Copy that. They said he was in the conference room.

179
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,460
We got a survivor.

180
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,940
I'm going in.

181
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Looks like the President's son. He's dead.

182
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,600
Where's the President? This may be him. Wait, hold on. This may be him.

183
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,800
Mr. President? He's still alive.

184
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,500
I repeat, the President is alive.

185
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,100
We need medivac teams in here ASAP. Did you read that? We need medivac teams in here.

186
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,000
I have Agent Buchanan for the Vice President.

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Yes, he's right here. Bill Buchanan.

188
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,700
Bill.

189
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:02,900
Mr. Vice President. I'm in direct contact with the rescue teams at the crash site of Air Force One. President Keeler is alive.

190
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,400
Thank God!

191
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Yes, Sir.

192
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,300
But he's in critical condition. He is unconscious, he's lost a lot of blood,

193
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,950
there's no chance he's going to be able to lead this country,

194
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,600
certainly not for a few days, and probably much longer.

195
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,100
Mr. Vice President?

196
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,300
Yes, I'm here.

197
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,600
This is all confirmed?

198
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,100
The President is being medivaced to the nearest emergency center as we speak.

199
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,600
Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th amendment, and take control of things as soon as possible.

200
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,100
I understand. Thank you, Bill.

201
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,100
President Keeler is alive but he's incapacitated.

202
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,000
We should, uh... we should probably contact the Cabinet members.

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,200
Actually, sir, I've already put that in motion.

204
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,400
Most of the Cabinet members are standing by. The others will be very soon.

205
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,900
You did without my permission?

206
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,700
I... You had enough to worry about, sir. I thought it'd be best to be prepared.

207
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Yes. All right.

208
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,300
Thank you.

209
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,000
Shall I begin the process of collecting votes?

210
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes, go ahead.

211
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,700
I can't get a signal.

212
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,400
Try up here.

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,200
Got it.

214
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,900
Kelly. Look at this.

215
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,400
what is it?

216
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,900
I'm not sure, but if it's what I think it is...

217
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,100
I read this article once, I think it's got a funny name, umm... I can't remember

218
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,800
but it's got our nuclear codes. It goes everywhere the President goes, and he can launch an attack from it.

219
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,300
We gotta call somebody.

220
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,800
Who are you gonna call?

221
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,200
I'll start with the police, I guess. They'll put us through to the right people.

222
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,600
The Football transponder's signal's still strong.

223
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,400
Hello?

224
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,300
Hey, it's me.

225
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,100
Look, when I walked away from you at CTU, I felt like you didn't understand what I was trying to say.

226
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,950
I'm not telling you that you shouldn't care. I care. I care about you.

227
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,800
I care about what happened to Paul, I feel completely responsible for it.

228
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,400
But right now this country is under attack, and I've got a job to do, and I don't have a choice.

229
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,200
Jack, I understand. What you have to do is very important.

230
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,600
I just didn't want us to leave things like that.

231
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm glad. Me neither.

232
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,800
Audrey, hold on a second. I gotta take this call.

233
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,100
Wait, Jack. Take the call. Stay focused on what you have to do.

234
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,600
Yeah, I'll talk to you in a little while.

235
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,700
OK.

236
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This is Bauer.

237
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Jack, it's Tony.

238
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I got a guy on the line the police put through. He's in the desert, says he found a case.

239
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,500
Jack, this guy found the Football.

240
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
OK. Let me speak to him.

241
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
All right. His name's Jason Gerard. We're running a background check as we speak.

242
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
I'm patching him through right now.

243
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,800
OK. Tony, stay on the other line.

244
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Mr. Gerard?

245
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,100
Yeah. Hey, call me Jason. I'm with my wife Kelly. Who's this?

246
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,900
Jason, my name is Jack Bauer. I'm a Federal Agent with the Department of Defense.

247
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,700
My colleague Agent Almeida says you found what we refer to as "the Football".

248
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,100
Yeah, it sure looks that way.

249
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,500
I mean, I don't know very much about this sort of thing. My wife and I are just out here on a camping trip.

250
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,300
OK, fine. Why don't you just describe to me what you found?

251
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,700
Sure. It's a black-leather briefcase; it's got a number paneling over by the handle.

252
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,700
It was in a protective case that had the Presidential seal on it.

253
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,800
Well, that sounds like it.

254
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,650
Right now I'm in a helicopter. I'm about 20 minutes away from you.

255
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,500
Look, I just want you to hang out there and wait for me.

256
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,000
I think someone beat you to the punch. I see headlights.

257
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,800
How far away?

258
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,900
Uh, it's hard to tell. A few miles?

259
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,500
OK, just hold on a second, Jason.

260
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,200
Tony. This kid Jason says he's got headlights headed towards him. Do we have any ground units in his vicinity?

261
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,000
No.

262
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,100
How about patrol park rangers, anything?

263
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,200
No, nobody.

264
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,300
How can that be?

265
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,500
We're spread thin, Jack. All state agencies are still assisting with the evacuation.

266
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,000
Jason, are the headlights headed straight for you?

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,800
Yeah. They're pretty much coming this way.

268
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Damn it. This situation just got a lot more complicated than we thought.

269
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,900
What do you mean?

270
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,700
The Football has a transponder. It's a tracking device that allows anyone to

271
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,500
pinpoint its exact location, as long as they've got the right frequency.

272
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,200
Do you think someone got a hold of the frequency who's not supposed to have it?

273
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,100
Right now we're gonna have to make that assumption.

274
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,200
Well, who do you think it is?

275
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,300
The terrorists who carried out today's attacks.

276
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,200
Listen, if I'm right we don't have a lot of time.

277
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,500
I need you to remove the transponder and take the Football, and get away from there as far as you can.

278
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,300
Uh... All right.

279
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,200
Flashlight. Get your light.

280
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
OK, uh... Go ahead.

281
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,600
The transponder's tiny, and it's hidden in the surface of the case. It's designed not to be found.

282
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,500
Then how am I supposed to find it?

283
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,400
Do you have a compass and a flashlight?

284
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,700
Uh, yeah. Get the compass.

285
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,500
OK, I want you to move the compass over the surface of the case slowly.

286
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,200
The transponder puts out an electromagnetic field.

287
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,700
It's not very strong, but it should move the needle.

288
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,400
Just move the compass over the surface of the case slowly,

289
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
and watch the needle.

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Here, here, here. Get the beam of the compass.

291
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,300
I think I got it. I found it. I found it.

292
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,300
OK, good. Take a knife or a sharp rock, and start scratching the surface hard.

293
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Hurry.

294
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,400
- Damn it.  - Jason, they're coming.

295
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,900
Come on, Jason, talk to me.

296
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,500
I'm working on it.

297
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,200
OK, I think I got it.

298
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,400
OK, I want you to take the compass, put it over the scraped area and tell me, is the needle moving?

299
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,600
No, no, it's not.

300
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,500
OK, you've disabled it. Good work. How far away is the vehicle?

301
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,600
Not far!

302
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,400
OK, I need you to take the Football and start moving.

303
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
I don't care which direction, just start moving now. I'll get back to you.

304
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
We gotta go. We gotta go now.

305
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,900
Tony, I'm gonna need surveillance of the entire area put up to my screen.

306
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,300
Why are we stopping?

307
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,900
We've lost the signal.

308
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
How is that possible?

309
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,600
I don't know. Maybe it was damaged on impact.

310
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,700
And it just happens to malfunction now that we're getting closer?

311
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,000
Scan the area for cell phones, active and passive signals.

312
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,500
Yeah?

313
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,200
Jason. OK, we found a reserve power station about a half a mile north of you.

314
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,100
Yeah, that's right. I remember it from the map.

315
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,000
OK, I want you to go there now.

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
It's OK. Yeah. Yeah, we'll get there.

317
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,150
The station's a large unmanned facility. I want you to break in and find a place to hide.

318
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,800
I want you to avoid using your flashlight, and as soon as you hang up,

319
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,300
I want you to take your cell batteries out.

320
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,100
The batteries?

321
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,650
Yeah, to prevent something called passive triangulation.

322
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,200
In other words, it'll stop you from being followed.

323
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,700
What if I need to contact you?

324
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,500
If you need to contact me, put the batteries back in, but only if you have to.

325
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,400
Now, I'm gonna give you my direct line. Have you got a pen?

326
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,900
Yeah. Hold on.

327
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,500
Go ahead.

328
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,400
310-597-3781

329
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
OK, yeah, I got it.

330
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,100
Start moving now.

331
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,700
OK.

332
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,600
He said to take the battery out of the cell phone. Come on.

333
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,000
I had a cell phone signal for a few seconds. It's moving, but it's gone now.

334
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
Did it move enough to yield a vector?

335
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Wait. Yes, it was headed a few degrees west of north, just before we cut off.

336
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,700
Check the map. See if there's anything near there.

337
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:49,000
There's a reserve power plant. A kilometer away, maybe less.

338
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,700
Whoever has the Football, that's where they're heading.

339
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,700
This is it.

340
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,900
Stay back.

341
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,400
We're not in any danger, right?

342
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,500
I mean, how can anyone even know that we're here?

343
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,500
We're just being safe.

344
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,400
Not a relaxing weekend in the desert, just like I said...

345
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,800
They're here. I gotta call Jack.

346
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,300
Come on.

347
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,200
This is Bauer.

348
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,800
It's Jason. These terrorists you talked about? They're here.

349
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,800
How many?

350
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
I just saw two jeeps.

351
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,700
Where are you?

352
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
Just inside the power plant. When are you going to get here?

353
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,900
Soon, just stand by.

354
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,900
Go, Kelly, go, go.

355
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,700
Tony, it's Jack. We're out of time. We need the schematics for the power plant now.

356
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,300
Yeah, it should be on your screen in a few seconds.

357
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,100
OK, I got it. Thanks.

358
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Jason, you're still with me?

359
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,200
Yeah, I'm with you.

360
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,100
Which side of the building did you enter?

361
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,900
Uh... The, the south side.

362
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,500
This is a large facility.

363
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,000
I want you to go to the lower level, southeast corner.

364
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,000
I'll find you there as soon as we land.

365
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,500
Ok.

366
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,000
Hey, hey, Agent Bauer? Please hurry.

367
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,700
We are.

368
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,100
Find them.

369
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,900
There's got to be stairs somewhere.

370
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Here they are, here they are.

371
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,900
Wait. What if it's a dead end?

372
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,500
There's a man and a woman.

373
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,700
Where are they?

374
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,000
This way.

375
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,400
They were down here.

376
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,300
Follow them and flush them out.

377
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,800
Go around and cut off the exits.

378
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,000
Go up there, go up there.

379
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,700
Come on, come on, come on.

380
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,600
Ok.

381
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,400
Anything?

382
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,500
Nothing.

383
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,200
Helicopter.

384
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Intercept it.

385
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Ok.

386
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Jason.

387
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Where are you?

388
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,500
We just landed. We're approaching the building. Where are you?

389
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,100
We're inside the plant, on the lower level.

390
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,500
Jack! Jack!

391
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,900
Jason, you're still there?

392
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,300
I'm here. They're inside the building. We cannot keep hiding. They are gonna find us.

393
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,100
I know. You gotta keep moving. I'll get back right back to you.

394
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,900
Edgar Stiles.

395
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,900
Edgar, it's Jack. I need to speak to Audrey Raines now.

396
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,900
Ms. Raines, Jack's on line one.

397
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,600
Jack.

398
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,600
Audrey, I'm taking fire. The other agent's been killed.

399
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
I need the last code for the Football now.

400
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,000
All right. Hang on.

401
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,400
Take the Football, take the Football! Come on.

402
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Jack. star76114.

403
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,700
I got it.

404
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,300
Hey.

405
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,900
Jason, I need you to open the case. The combination is star76114.

406
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
Why? Where does that plant us?

407
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,600
Just do it. *76114.

408
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,500
He wants us to open the briefcase. *76114.

409
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,500
OK, it's open.

410
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,900
OK. Inside should be a phone, a control board and a book with colored pages. It's called the Playbook.

411
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,900
I want you to remove the Playbook. Give the case with the control board back to your wife. The two items need to stay separated.

412
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,600
Why?

413
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,600
Because the control board is useless without the Playbook.

414
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,290
I need you and your wife to split up.

415
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,000
He wants us to split up.

416
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,400
I can hear him.

417
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,800
I am not leaving my wife.

418
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,700
You have to.

419
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,900
Forget it.

420
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Jason, please listen to me. I know how scared you are

421
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,900
but if this man gets what he wants, he's gonna kill both of you.

422
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,700
Right now the only chance you have to survive is to separate, do you understand me?

423
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,900
It's OK, Jason. He's kept us alive this far. Let's just do what he says.

424
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,000
Just get here as fast as you can.

425
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,900
I will.

426
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,200
I love you.

427
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,000
I love you.

428
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,500
Give me the Playbook.

429
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,700
Here, you take the phone.

430
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,350
I want you to go to that top wile over there, all right?

431
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,500
I'm gonna stay down here. You just find a place to hide, all right?

432
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,100
Go, go, go, go. Go. Hide, hide.

433
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,900
I've got him!

434
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,200
He's clean.

435
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,400
Where's the control board?

436
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,900
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

437
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
Tell me what I want to know.

438
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,900
I swear, I don't know what you're talking about. Please.

439
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,100
It doesn't have to be this painful.

440
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,900
This is Bauer.

441
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
They've got my husband. They're hurting him.

442
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,700
Where are you? I'm on the lower level.

443
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,400
We had to leave. We're on the second floor. I don't know where.

444
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,900
OK, I'm on my way.

445
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
They're gonna kill him.

446
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,900
Kelly, stay on the phone. Keep talking to me.

447
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,100
I can't.

448
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,900
Kelly!

449
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,300
Please...

450
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,000
Where is the control board?

451
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,400
Stop.

452
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,000
I have what you want.

453
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,800
Give it to me.

454
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,300
First, you let my husband go.

455
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
No!

456
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,700
OK. OK.

457
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,700
I'll give it to you if you promise not to kill us.

458
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,200
I won't kill you. I promise.

459
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,800
It's over there.

460
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
It's behind the pillar.

461
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,700
It's locked.

462
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,600
What is the code?

463
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,000
It's uh... *76114.

464
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,300
It's here.

465
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,900
Let's go.

466
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,500
Kill them.

467
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,500
This is Jack Bauer. I need a medic. Second level, north end of the building.

468
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,900
It's all right. He's gonna be OK. Help is on the way.

469
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
Where is the Football?

470
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,700
They have it. They went out that door.

471
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,700
Don't be. You did great. Thank you.

473
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,700
Air support, two hostiles just left the building.

474
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,600
I do not have possession of the Football. I repeat, I do not have possession of the Football.

475
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,900
Air support, the Football is in the lead jeep headed north. Take it out.

476
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,500
I repeat, take it out.

477
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,700
Put your hands where I can see them!

478
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,700
Air support, I cannot see the Football in the vehicle.

479
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,500
Shine your spotlight on me and follow.

480
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,300
Air support, I'm in possession of the Football. Go after the other jeep.

481
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,400
Almeida.

482
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,200
Tony, it's Jack.

483
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,300
I'm in possession of the Football. Three hostiles are down, one escaped.

484
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan.

485
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,600
I'm sorry, but I had to make a choice.

486
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,100
Marwan gave us the Football to buy his freedom?

487
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,800
Yeah, that doesn't sound right to me either.

488
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,200
What are you thinking?

489
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,000
I don't know.

490
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,300
Let me ask you something. Is anything missing?

491
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,700
No. All the components are here.

492
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,800
Hold on one second.

493
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,200
Tony, I was wrong. There are some pages missing.

494
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,000
All right, look, Jack, the sections are color-coded. What's missing?

495
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,300
Red Chapter, Section Three.

496
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,700
Get Audrey.

497
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,200
All right. We'll call you right back.

498
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,300
You're worried about him.

499
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,500
I am. He seems unsure of himself.

500
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
No, Mike, trust me.

501
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,300
He spent his whole life preparing for this.

502
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,900
He's just being cautious, feeling his way along. He'll be fine.

503
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,300
Yeah?

504
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,100
Well, the vote was unanimous. The 25th amendment's been officially invoked.

505
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,600
Tell the press we're ready. Let's get this done.

506
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,200
Mr. Vice President,

507
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,800
the 25th amendment is in effect.

508
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,700
Any descending votes?

509
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,700
None, sir.

510
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,700
Well, we should proceed with the sworning then.

511
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Yes, sir. The sworning will only take a minute, and then we'll take a short break and you can address the nation.

512
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,700
I'm still not entirely certain that a live address makes much sense this time of night.

513
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:54,100
After what's happened today, sir, an awful lot of people are wide awake. I'm sure they'd like to hear from you directly.

514
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,700
Yes, of course.

515
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,300
We're ready, sir.

516
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,700
Please. Please. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

517
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,400
Yeah?

518
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,300
Jack, it's Tony.

519
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,700
Is Audrey there?

520
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Jack, I'm here.

521
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Tell me what the contents are of the missing pages.

522
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,600
Jack, it's the Red Section which contains warhead locations and activation codes.

523
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,200
But we started canceling all the activation codes as soon as Air Force One went down.

524
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,700
Yes, but there are thousands of warheads. It's gonna take an hour to clear the slate.

525
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,500
Jack, in the meantime, if they get a hold of a warhead and a matching activation code, we will not be able to stop them.

526
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,700
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

527
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,300
Mr. Novick's office.

528
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,800
Let me speak to Mike Novick.

529
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Yes, sir, right away.

530
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:15,300
I soundly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States, and will, in the best of my ability,

531
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,000
preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.

532
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,180
Mr. President, I appreciate it.

533
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,700
Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you coming at this late hour.

534
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Novick.

535
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,400
Mike, it's Jack. We got a problem.

536
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,900
... to take this oath under tragic circumstances. Words cannot express the sense of sadness...

537
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,700
Part of the Football's been compromised.

538
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,600
Yes, I'll tell him.

539
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,900
Mr. President.

540
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,100
I just received a phone call from CTU.

541
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm sorry to tell you, sir, but it appears that part of the Nuclear Football has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,270
This is Air Force One. We are declaring an emergency.

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,760
We're not gonna make it. I have to put it down now.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,750
Chloe, what's happening?

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:22,720
Chloe!

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,110
Air Force One is down.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,070
This may be him.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,590
It's the President.

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,200
He's still alive.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,860
I repeat, the President is alive.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,540
Marwan has to be within a 50-mile radius...

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:39,970
Jack.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,070
There's a higher priority than finding Marwan.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,820
What is it?

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,290
Recovering the nuclear football.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,560
Didn't it go down with Air Force One?

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,620
The missile inflicted enough damage that 

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,440
the plane left a trail of debris as it went down.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,660
A lot of things were sucked out, including the football.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,610
That case contains the  

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,110
codes and locations of our entire nuclear arsenal.

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,410
What's the location of the football?

22
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,560
40 miles northeast of here in the middle of the desert.

23
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,490
Air support!

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,820
Football is in the lead jeep headed north.

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,570
Take it out!

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm in possession of the football.

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Three hostiles are down,

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,450
one escaped.

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,650
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan.

30
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,960
There's some pages missing.

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,260
Tell me what the contents are of the missing pages.

32
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,900
Jack, it's the red section 

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,460
which contains warhead locations and activation codes.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,790
If they get ahold of a warhead and a matching activation code,

35
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,180
we will not be able to stop them.

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,460
Mr. vice President...

37
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,250
President Keeler is alive.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,430
But he's in critical condition.

39
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,200
Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th amendment

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,430
and take control of things as soon as possible.

41
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,740
You're worried about him?

42
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,910
I am.

43
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,890
He seems unsure of himself.

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,190
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute

45
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,200
the office of the President of the united states,

46
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,530
preserve, protect and defend 

47
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,780
the constitution of the united states.

48
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,260
Mr. President, I have just received a phone call from CTU.

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,450
Part of the nuclear football 

50
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,770
has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,200
Vice President Logan has been sworn into office.

52
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,000
He's now President of the united states.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
His office called, they want an update from us in 15 minutes.

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,500
We're working on several protocols related to the plane crash.

55
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,900
What is he going to want to focus on?

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,070
He's going to want to know how a stealth fighter was

57
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,300
stolen from one of our air bases and, more to the point,

58
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,400
how it was able to take down 

59
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Air Force One with one of our own missiles.

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
Has he been briefed on Marwan?

61
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,400
He knows Marwan is the mastermind behind today's events, yes.

62
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,200
But he's going to want more specifics on the football.

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Where are we on that?

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Jack's at the debris field outside of Indio.

65
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,500
He's trying to reconstruct the 

66
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,600
red chapter of the playbook that was stolen by Marwan.

67
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,560
How's he doing that?

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,300
He's working with Fred Laughton from the department of defense.

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
He wrote the codes, so he'll know what's missing.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,700
Good.

71
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,200
Who's going to run point on this update?

72
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,100
You and Tony.

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,110
All right, everyone, we don't have a lot of time, 

74
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,000
so we're going to have to fast-track this.

75
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,000
Double source all intel through homeland security and CIA.

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,700
Skip the usual request procedures,

77
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,200
tie into their data directly.

78
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,660
Yes?

79
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,500
Ms. Dessler, I've got Jack Bauer on the line.

80
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,300
Put him through.

81
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,200
Go ahead, Jack.

82
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,100
Michelle, are you still in briefing?

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,500
Yes, Jack, you're on speaker.

84
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,500
What have you found?

85
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,650
Fred Laughton and I just finished a rough reconstruction

86
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,700
of the red chapter- we're getting that over to you now.

87
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Jack, it's Bill Buchanan.

88
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
Summarize our exposure.

89
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,060
What information exactly does Marwan now have in his possession?

90
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,650
Well, the red chapter lays out 

91
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,900
the location of our domestic nuclear arsenal.

92
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,560
The inventory is in the thousands.

93
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,070
Many of the weapons are in transit 

94
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,800
as part of our standard shift operations.

95
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Why can't DOD just secure these weapons?

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,300
Because a number of the weapons are in between checkpoints.

97
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,700
It would take over an hour to account for all of them.

98
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,620
Listen, everyone, we've got to remember, 

99
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,600
Marwan only needs one.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
All right, Jack, we'll get on this immediately.

101
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,370
Get back here as soon as you can 

102
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,950
and help Audrey liaison with DOD.

103
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,100
We need to account for every single weapon documented in that chapter.

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,900
I'm on my way.

105
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,630
The coordinates for the third one are 

106
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,100
latitude 37 degrees, 14 minutes.

107
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,800
Longitude 115 degrees, 21 minutes.

108
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,100
There it is.

109
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
Jefferson City, Iowa.

110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,900
When is the warhead due to arrive?

111
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,700
7:00 a.m., Local time.

112
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,200
Five hours from now.

113
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,700
That puts it somewhere 200 miles east.

114
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
It's still in Illinois.

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,600
We can intercept it anywhere from this point to here.

116
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,800
All right.

117
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Let's put our people in place.

118
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,540
The warheads that are in transit because of the daily

119
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,600
shift-and-hide operations pose the biggest problem.

120
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,000
We can verify military traffic in the coastal areas from here.

121
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,500
Why don't we find out what DOD has in the midwest.

122
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,760
Yeah, that's already underway.

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Audrey said she should have it in a few minutes.

124
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,900
Look, Tony...

125
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Am I interrupting something?

126
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,950
No, Chloe.

127
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,600
What is it?

128
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,200
Are you logged on to division three?

129
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,600
Yeah.

130
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,500
Look at this,

131
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,150
15 minutes ago, the credit card of Eric Murphy

132
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,200
was used at the western gas station in Torrance.

133
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,300
Who's Eric Murphy?

134
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,300
His real name is Yosik Khatami.

135
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
He's a terrorist affiliated with Marwan.

136
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,100
How do we know that?

137
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Through a watch list.

138
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,500
We put out a net asking for anybody connected to the name Habib Marwan.

139
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,300
We didn't expect to get any hits so soon.

140
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Why was he so careless?

141
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,900
Maybe he wasn't.

142
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,300
Maybe it's some sort of decoy.

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,650
Well, it wouldn't be much of a decoy 

144
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,100
because we don't know where he is or what direction they're traveling in.

145
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
This was a mistake.

146
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,100
Did the gas station have a surveillance camera?

147
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,100
Yes. He's driving a black lexus 300.

148
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,800
Are we hooked into satellite?

149
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes, we're monitoring them now.

150
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,200
If this guy's still on the road, we'll find him.

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,100
Who do we have in the area to run point?

152
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,560
Curtis just left division.

153
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,900
He's heading over here right now.

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,250
Divert him to western gas station.

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,500
Have field ops meet him there.

156
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,400
All right.

157
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
This is Audrey.

158
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,500
Hey, it's me.

159
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey.

160
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,500
Are you on your way back here?

161
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Yeah.

162
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,400
How much of the weaponry has been accounted for so far?

163
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,260
72 percent.

164
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,900
We're having problems getting confirmations from the midwest.

165
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,900
Why?

166
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,130
There are several convoys shipping weapons to be

167
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,500
dismantled in accordance with the arms reduction treaty.

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,230
A lot of them were re-routed 

169
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,800
after the train bombing this morning.

170
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,260
Just use local channels.

171
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,400
All weapon transports have to check in with regional substations.

172
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,500
Just call them directly.

173
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
All right, I'll do that.

174
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,400
How you holding up?

175
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm okay.

176
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,700
What have the doctors told you about Paul?

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
They're having a hard time keeping him stable.

178
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,350
You just hang in there.

179
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,200
He'll fight through it.

180
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,800
Yeah.

181
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,900
Tell Michelle I'll be there in 20 minutes.

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,900
All right, will do.

183
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,500
Bye.

184
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,200
Yes.

185
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Marwan, it's me.

186
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Is everything all right?

187
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,300
No.

188
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,400
No, it's not.

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,800
I made a stupid mistake.

190
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,700
They're going to find me.

191
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,100
What happened?

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
I stopped to get gas.

193
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,880
While I was driving away, I realized I used the wrong credit card, 

194
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,800
the one with the name Eric Murphy,

195
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,400
the one you gave me.

196
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,100
I told you to get rid of that one.

197
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
I was in a hurry, Habib.

198
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,400
I had to make the arrangements for the delivery of the warhead.

199
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,100
When that transaction gets flagged, they'll be searching the highways.

200
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,700
I know, that's why I'm not on the highway anymore.

201
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,700
Where are you?

202
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Inglewood.

203
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,900
I'm on my way to Prado's now.

204
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,800
You're closer to the marina.

205
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,360
Go straight there.

206
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
I'll have him meet you.

207
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,500
Prado can make arrangements to get you out of the country.

208
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Thank you, Habib.

209
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,300
Thank you.

210
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,600
Mr. President, it may be precipitous moving to the bunker now.

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,090
Working from the oval office might exhibit a greater

212
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,600
sense of confidence in our abilities to handle this crisis.

213
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,370
The purpose of the bunker is to 

214
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,600
protect the President in times of crises, is it not?

215
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,400
Yes, sir.

216
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,200
Now, I feel it's always wiser to take the prudent course.

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
Will I be able to function at 100 percent down here, Mike?

218
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,400
Absolutely, Mr. President.

219
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,100
What kind of protection does this bunker afford?

220
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,900
Total.

221
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,100
You're 200 feet below the surface.

222
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,300
If the white house suffers a direct hit,

223
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,900
everyone in the bunker would be safe,

224
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,600
as would the communication infrastructure to the rest of the country.

225
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Let's hope that's not needed.

226
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,690
Mr. President...

227
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Bill Buchanan from CTU is on the line.

228
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,100
Hello, Bill.

229
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
What do you have for me?

230
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,990
Mr. President, I'm here with Michelle Dessler,

231
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,270
director of CTU Los Angeles 

232
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,000
and Tony Almeida, heading up tactical.

233
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,700
Good.

234
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,500
Let's get started.

235
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,300
Have all of our armaments referenced in the red chapter been secured?

236
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,760
Not completely, Mr. President,

237
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,400
but we're working with DOD on that.

238
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,100
What else do we know?

239
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,780
The man who has choreographed today's events, 

240
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,300
Habib Marwan, is still at large.

241
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,800
Most likely he is in possession of the red chapter.

242
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,100
What are we doing to find him?

243
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
We just picked up a thread, sir.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,280
We have a location where 

245
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,100
one of Marwan's associates was detected 20 minutes ago.

246
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,500
That sounds promising.

247
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,900
What else?

248
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,100
We're sifting through all of our intel now.

249
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,000
We're hoping to put together a pursuit scenario soon.

250
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,320
So you're pretty confident you'll be able to 

251
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,300
catch this terrorist, this Habib Marwan,

252
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,100
before he strikes again?

253
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,600
It's not an exact science, sir.

254
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,700
All we can do is maximize the probability for success.

255
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,100
There are no guarantees.

256
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,860
Of course.

257
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
I understand that.

258
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,400
We need to get control of the situation.

259
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I can't run the government from down here indefinitely,

260
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,200
but I'm not going upstairs until it's safe.

261
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Sir...

262
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
I think their time is better spent working up what they have.

263
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,800
I recommend we let them get back to it.

264
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay, Bill...

265
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Call us when you have something more concrete.

266
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,700
Yes, sir, I will.

267
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,300
All right, let's get back to it.

268
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,460
Wait a second. Wait a second. 

269
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Does anybody else feel uneasy about what we just heard here?

270
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,800
In what way?

271
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Logan's supposed to the man who speaks to the

272
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
people of this country and exudes confidence.

273
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,200
Not fear.

274
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,980
Air Force One was just attacked, 

275
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,100
President Keeler is in critical conditional.

276
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Logan was just sworn in, give him time.

277
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,600
We don't have time.

278
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,560
We've got Yosik Khatami.

279
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
A traffic cam picked him up, heading towards the coast.

280
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,260
We have him on satellite.

281
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,240
Link this up to Curtis, 

282
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,900
I want him running point on this takedown.

283
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,500
Tell Curtis to remain discreet.

284
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,090
I want to know what Khatami's doing, 

285
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,800
who he's meeting, before we take him down.

286
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,300
Michelle...

287
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,300
I was out of line before, about you and Bill.

288
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,500
It's your life, and I've got no right to judge you.

289
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,500
I appreciate that.

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,890
And whatever tension there is between us, 

291
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,600
I want to apologize for my part in it.

292
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,720
I'd like it if we could just let it go, 

293
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,700
so we could do our jobs.

294
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,000
Leave the past in the past and move on.

295
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,400
Sounds good.

296
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,100
All right.

297
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,230
Curtis just called in.

298
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,830
He's about to arrive at the marina and set up.

299
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,470
Good, set up a satellite, also patch in an audio link.

300
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,470
I'll take care of it now.

301
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,170
Thanks, Edgar.

302
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,670
You want me to run point on that?

303
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,770
No, Bill and I will do that, but I want you in on others.

304
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:33,770
To do what?

305
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,870
I'd like your tactical input.

306
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,170
Fine, uh, I'll have Edgar transfer everything over to the situation room.

307
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,430
I get the feeling Tony's not entirely

308
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,970
comfortable with the configuration here today.

309
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,870
We haven't seen each other for a very long time.

310
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,570
It's uncomfortable for both of us.

311
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,770
The difference is, you seem to be able to stay on point.

312
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,570
I'm not so sure about him.

313
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:01,870
I am.

314
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,670
He'll be fine.

315
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,170
He's alone.

316
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,470
What's he doing?

317
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,070
It looks like a meet.

318
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,970
He's waiting for someone.

319
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,670
Is the marine unit in place?

320
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,570
Yeah, behind the jetty.

321
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,790
Looks like the man Yosik's meeting just arrived, 

322
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,870
he's walking towards him.

323
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,970
Is it Marwan?

324
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:24,970
I can't tell.

325
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,370
Remember, Curtis, we need them both alive.

326
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,570
All right, copy.

327
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,070
All right, all teams, I'll close off the foot of the pier.

328
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,770
Keep them contained, but do not shoot to kill.

329
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,070
Repeat, do not shoot to kill.

330
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,870
Damn it.

331
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,070
Teams respond.

332
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,570
Who is that?

333
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,070
This is Macallan at point three.

334
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,370
It looks like a private patrol.

335
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,470
All right, hold your positions.

336
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:01,670
Yosik...

337
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:03,970
Brother.

338
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,270
You're late.

339
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,070
I've been standing here waiting for you.

340
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,070
Well, I'm here now.

341
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,370
Let's go.

342
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,970
Come on.

343
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,270
What are you waiting for?

344
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,970
Wait.

345
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,120
What's the matter?

346
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,870
Someone's here.

347
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,470
It's okay.

348
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,620
It's just marina security.

349
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,170
No, something's wrong.

350
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,270
They're onto us.

351
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,370
Yosik, now.

352
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,970
The man he's meeting is not Marwan.

353
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,770
Is there anybody else there besides the two of them?

354
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,370
Not unless there's someone else on the boat.

355
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,570
All right, marine units, move into position.

356
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,570
All teams, move in.

357
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,570
We're okay.

358
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,570
I think we should just get out of here.

359
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,170
There was a police officer out there.

360
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,570
I told you, that's harbor security.

361
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,870
They stop by all the time.

362
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,330
Damn it.

363
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:48,970
Who the hell's that?

364
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,370
This is CTU.

365
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,170
We have you completely surrounded.

366
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,630
Yes?

367
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,470
They found us!

368
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,270
Where are you?

369
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:01,630
It doesn't matter.

370
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,520
It's over, they're going to get us.

371
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,370
Yosik, you can't let that happen.

372
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,870
You cannot allow yourself to be captured.

373
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,370
I understand.

374
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,270
Also, you have to kill Prado.

375
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,570
He knows too much.

376
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,070
I'll do what's necessary.

377
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,170
Yosik?

378
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,070
Yosik?

379
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,970
Come out with your hands up!

380
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,370
You're completely surrounded.

381
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,270
There's no escape.

382
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,870
Drop the gun!

383
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,170
Put the gun down!

384
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:35,770
Step off the boat.

385
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,970
Get off the boat.

386
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,970
There's a man inside.

387
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,520
I shot him, he was gonna kill me.

388
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,570
He was trying to steal my boat.

389
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,270
It was self-defense.

390
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,270
Put your hands on your head.

391
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,070
Who are you?

392
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,670
Who are you?

393
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,270
My name's Joe Prado.

394
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,570
I'm innocent.

395
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,670
I have nothing to hide.

396
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,370
Where's Yosik?

397
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,070
He's dead.

398
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,470
This phone was lying next to him.

399
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,370
Get him out of here.

400
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:07,970
Let's go.

401
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,470
Secure the boat.

402
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,170
Yosik's dead.

403
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,670
We have the man he was meeting.

404
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,870
He says his name is Joe Prado.

405
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,770
Bring him in.

406
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,070
We also recovered Yosik's cell phone.

407
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,470
We'll try and pull something off it.

408
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,370
I'll report to you en route.

409
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,280
Good work, Curtis.

410
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,170
We're standing by.

411
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,670
What do you want to do?

412
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,170
Control the situation.

413
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,370
Make sure Prado doesn't talk to the authorities.

414
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,170
He can hurt us.

415
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,970
How do we get to him?

416
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,070
We can't.

417
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,270
Not directly.

418
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,430
Hello?

419
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,470
This is Marwan.

420
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,670
Yes, Marwan?

421
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,170
Can you reach Amnesty Global at this hour?

422
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,370
What do you need?

423
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,970
An attorney.

424
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:05,830
I'm sure I can.

425
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,780
Tell them that an innocent man is being held without charges

426
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,870
and is about to be tortured at CTU Los Angeles.

427
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,880
By god's grace, President Keeler survived, 

428
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,970
but more than 75 others did not.

429
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,570
I share in your grief and anger from this tragedy.

430
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,270
My family and I feel no differently than each and every one of you.

431
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,870
We are shocked, saddened and maybe a little afraid.

432
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,680
These terrorists have displayed,

433
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,370
once again, their indifference toward human life.

434
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,670
They will pay for what they have done, I assure you.

435
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,670
Bill, excuse me.

436
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,870
There's a convoy missing.

437
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,770
What?

438
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,040
It was headed from Illinois to Jefferson city, Iowa,

439
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,170
it disappeared just inside the border.

440
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,830
Disappeared?

441
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,770
They were due to call in at their checkpoint every 20 minutes, they didn't.

442
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,170
I tried to reach them on comsat.

443
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,170
There was no reply.

444
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,070
What about satellite?

445
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:58,970
Nothing showing up.

446
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,270
What was on the trucks?

447
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,870
A nuclear warhead.

448
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,070
Our faith and our resolve will prevail.

449
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,170
Okay, we've got the fingerprints.

450
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,970
I'll run them through our databases.

451
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:25,570
Thanks.

452
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,770
What do we know about the prisoner Curtis is bringing in?

453
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,770
Just the name he gave, Joe Prado.

454
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,970
Curtis just uploaded his picture and prints.

455
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,170
I'm running them through now.

456
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,320
Prep holding so Curtis can begin interrogation 

457
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,270
as soon as they arrive.

458
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,570
I want this man broken in minutes, not hours.

459
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,500
Clear all directories,

460
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,360
put all resources into finding this warhead.

461
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,070
Believe me, Mike, I wish I had known about this sooner, too.

462
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,170
Look, I'm not pointing fingers here.

463
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,360
I'm on your side,

464
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,480
but the President is not going to be happy

465
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,880
that the statement he made could be invalidated.

466
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,670
I don't know what to tell you.

467
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,570
We're putting everything we've got into finding this missing warhead.

468
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,870
All right, we'll get back to you.

469
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,570
Move!

470
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,170
Inside!

471
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:09,540
Let's go!

472
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,870
Move, move, move!

473
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,770
We've got it and we're heading out now.

474
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,970
General Thomas just told me we're missing a nuclear warhead.

475
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,370
Yes, I just heard some of the details from Bill Buchanan.

476
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,270
When did this happen?

477
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,470
It disappeared somewhere between 1:45 A.M.

478
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,840
And 2:15 central time.

479
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,670
None of our satellites was able to pick this up?

480
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,340
It was in mountain terrain at night.

481
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,580
Our people are analyzing the imagery now, 

482
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,370
but it's going to be hard to find.

483
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,340
What are we going to do if we don't find this man Marwan?

484
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,320
Our people are doing everything they can 

485
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,170
to contain him to the Los Angeles area.

486
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,140
It's going to be difficult for him to leave.

487
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,360
Yeah, well, it's difficult to shoot down Air Force One

488
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,670
with our own stealth fighters, but he managed to do that.

489
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,070
Who knows what else they're planning?

490
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,870
I'm sure he's going to come after me next.

491
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,570
Mr. President, there's no indication that that's his plan...

492
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,490
You don't know that!

493
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,340
I don't know that!

494
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,570
We don't have enough information to know what his plan is!

495
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,370
The head of Secret service is on his way over now.

496
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,030
He has a revised plan that 

497
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,270
I'm certain will ease your mind about your safety.

498
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,070
That's the bastard Curtis found at the marina.

499
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,670
The one that's helping the terrorists.

500
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,470
I guess.

501
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,570
I'd like to get him in a room for a few minutes.

502
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:02,770
What?

503
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,370
He'd talk to me in about two seconds.

504
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,870
Oh, you want to hurt him to get revenge for your mother dying.

505
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,670
I can understand that.

506
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:14,870
Take him to holding.

507
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,370
Did Edgar run the prints I sent?

508
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,170
Yeah. The name checks out.

509
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,770
Joseph Prado, ex-marine.

510
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,790
No criminal record, but over the last five

511
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,070
years, he's got no record of employment, either.

512
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,870
Which means he's a criminal or a mercenary.

513
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:27,670
That's right.

514
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,270
I'll find out if he knows anything about the missing warhead.

515
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,020
All right.

516
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:32,870
Tony.

517
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,270
What do you got?

518
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,240
I found the convoy.

519
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,470
I've just got off the Iowa highway patrol,

520
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,150
Millitary transfer was ambushed.

521
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,130
Everyone's dead.

522
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,640
What about the warhead?

523
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,640
Gone.

524
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,230
Alright, find out what kind of vechile being used to transport

525
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,400
also tell the local law-enforcement to put up premiters

526
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,300
I want you to check for any airstrip server remotely clearence 

527
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,090
they might be able to put down a chopper.

528
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,660
Yeah.

529
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,910
Remember he's ex-marine.

530
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,160
He won't cave easily.

531
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,230
I just need to establish that 

532
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,600
even we're in the government building.

533
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,870
I'm gonna go as far as it takes.

534
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,960
How are you gonna start?

535
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,870
I will use Richard.

536
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,400
Ok.

537
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,710
I've told you I'm not talking to you, pal.

538
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,070
I haven't been charged with anything and doing anything wrong.

539
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,870
I killed that man,it was a self-defence,

540
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,090
he was trying to steal my boat.

541
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,220
We both know it's a lie

542
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,510
So let's not wasting our time,what do you say,John?

543
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,780
I'm not saying anyting to you.

544
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,010
Now, you're lying to me.

545
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,230
What the hell is this?

546
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,380
Yes.

547
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,670
Michelle, where's Curtis?

548
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,420
He's just about start with Pardo.

549
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,370
Tell him to stop.

550
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:16,830
What?

551
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,940
That's an order, both of you, come to the floor, now.

552
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,790
- It was a self-defence.  - Curtis.

553
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,490
- You can't do this to me.  - Curtis.

554
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,490
What?

555
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,440
Bill wants to see us before you start.

556
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,460
Wait till I get back.

557
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,160
What's this about?

558
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,950
I don't know.

559
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,630
We have a problem.

560
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,500
This is David Winston from Mmnesty Global.

561
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,710
And I have a signed court order here protecting the

562
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,430
rights of Joesff Prado who knew have been in custody.

563
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,790
You see US Marshals are here to assure that 

564
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm taking to the prisoner immediately.

565
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,040
That's ridiculous.

566
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,080
That's your opinion.

567
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,750
But Mr. Prado's rights will not be violated

568
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,070
Take me to him now.

569
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,960
We are not assured Curtis. Do as he says.

570
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,320
There is a nuclear warhead missing.

571
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,650
This is our only lead, Bill.

572
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,610
I'll get into this with the Justice Department. 

573
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,780
In the meantime do what he says

574
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,770
When can I expect his call?

575
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,170
It's extremely important.

576
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,950
Yes,I understand that but I need to talk to the judge presonally, 

577
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,870
please have him called me back.

578
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,370
Mr. Buchanan.

579
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,720
Do you have those hourleads for me?

580
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,000
No, I don't.

581
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,070
but I'm here on another matter.

582
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,270
You what?

583
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,920
I heard the interrogation on Prado have been put on hold.

584
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,670
That's right.

585
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,000
Why?

586
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,470
You have a job to do, please get back to work.

587
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,970
I know I'm not supposed to be interfering in the matters of policy,

588
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,070
but considering what I have been through today

589
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,270
my mother dying because of these terrorists.

590
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:13,170
I want to know why you let some slamy lawyer protect the dirty-bag like Prado

591
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,580
We don't happy that either, but we're gonna fix it,

592
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,820
but it's gonna take some time.

593
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,320
That's time we don't have.

594
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,170
Edgar stop.

595
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,570
I'm trying to cut you some slack here,

596
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,970
but you need to get back to your job,

597
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,870
you need to put all that stuff aside and hold for awhile, please.

598
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,570
Yes,sir.

599
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,470
Yeah, Cannon.

600
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,970
Yes.

601
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,870
I'll hold for the judge.

602
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,710
What was that all about?

603
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,970
You're supposed to be doing the hourleads.

604
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,570
I know.

605
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,670
I don't want anybody keeps telling me what I'm supposed to be doing.

606
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,870
I have a photographic memory in case you forgot.

607
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,170
How can I forgot, you tell me like every other of the day.

608
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,170
I don't know why what's happened here,

609
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,070
we have some pc lawyer holding us up from doing our job.

610
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,490
Your job is do the hourleads,

611
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,870
you're holding yourself up.

612
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,370
Chole.

613
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,670
Have you heard of the mising warhead.

614
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,960
Yeah, FBI link up with our department yet?

615
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,520
Yes. I'm sharing both of databases.

616
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,270
OK. Good. Who's questioning the prisoner.

617
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,990
You mean Joseph Prado that Curtis broght in.

618
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,610
Yeah.

619
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,170
No one.

620
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,000
What are you talking about? 

621
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,140
The attorney came in from amnesty globe with a court

622
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,460
order saying we won't be allowed to being-alone with Prado.

623
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,860
Buchanan is on the phone with judge sending the order now.

624
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
I'll be right back.

625
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,360
I don't believe this.

626
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,160
I disagree with you, you honor, 

627
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,460
this does not fall outside the boundary of patriot land.

628
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,360
Yeah, alright thanks.

629
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,420
What the hell is going on here, 

630
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,870
you got the key witness on the missing warhead.

631
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,730
We should be pressing this guy with everything we've got.

632
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,550
Judge's known more about cha.

633
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,430
If you want to appeal we should wait until 7 A.M. take him to the pillar judge.

634
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,450
Does he know what the stakes are?

635
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,060
He does,but he's feeling Prado got no record 

636
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,500
he shouldn't be treated like a terrorist.

637
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,580
What about the fact that he was caught meeting with

638
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,470
known terrorist in the middle of the night on appear?

639
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,560
Circumstantial.

640
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,710
Bill, we need to interrgoate this prisioner, 

641
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,860
I don't care what kind of court order we even get.

642
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,670
I agree, but the attorney is with him

643
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,460
U.S. Marshal's protecing his right.

644
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,860
Where's attorney?

645
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,860
In holding with Prado.

646
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,810
Jack, don't make it worse.

647
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,160
I just want to talk to him.

648
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,060
How much longer do I have to stay here?

649
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,720
I'm trying to get you out as soon as I can.

650
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,960
My office is in the process of filing a complaint.

651
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
They have nothing on me.

652
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,060
I was standing alone on my boat.

653
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,050
I don't even know the man'd going after.

654
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,160
Come in with me, Al.

655
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,120
Who are you?

656
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,660
My name is Jack Bauer, Department of Defense, and you are?

657
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,860
David Weiss, Amnesty Global.

658
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Curtis, why is the suspect not in his restraints?

659
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,860
Amnesty Global's order supersedes our authority.

660
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,060
Mr. Bauer, my client is cooperating.

661
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,220
He's not trying to go anywhere.

662
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,720
All he wants is to be treated like any other U.S. citizen.

663
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,450
Your client aided and abetted people who

664
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,660
attacked the President of the united states today.

665
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
You don't know that.

666
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,060
As a matter of fact, we do.

667
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,860
Then charge him.

668
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,060
May I speak with you privately?

669
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,760
Get the door.

670
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,560
You and I both know that your client isn't clean and

671
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,060
that he conspired to steal a U.S. nuclear warhead.

672
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,660
All my client wants is due process.

673
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Mr. Weiss,

674
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,260
these people are not gonna stop attacking us today

675
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,060
until millions and millions of americans are dead.

676
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,180
Now, I don't want to bypass the constitution,

677
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,260
but these are extraordinary circumstances.

678
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,760
The constitution was born out of extraordinary circumstances, Mr. Bauer.

679
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,060
This plays out by the book, not in a backroom with a rubber hose.

680
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,460
I hope you can live with that.

681
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,660
Sir, can I help you?

682
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,660
No, it's all right.

683
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,060
How did you get here so fast?

684
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,360
What?!

685
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,060
Who asked you to represent Mr. Prado?

686
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,320
I don't have to give you that information.

687
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,930
Curtis, from the time of his arrest, 

688
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,760
did the suspect have time to call a lawyer?

689
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,360
No.

690
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
Marwan called Amnesty Global.

691
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,260
This is his play.

692
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,460
That means Prado definitely knows something Marwan doesn't want us to hear.

693
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,060
We still can't get around that court order.

694
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,560
We need to call the President now.

695
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,160
We cannot have any leaks regarding this missing warhead.

696
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,960
I've contacted General Wilson in Iowa.

697
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,260
He's sealing off the roads while we clean up the ambushed convoy.

698
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,360
What about those highway patrol officers who discovered it?

699
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,060
Wilson's already brought them in and is explaining the situation.

700
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,260
The good news is, this is happening in the middle of the night.

701
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,460
Most of the country's still asleep.

702
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,360
Yes.

703
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,860
CTU Los Angeles is on the line for President Logan.

704
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,160
They say it's urgent.

705
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:36,860
Thank you, gentlemen.

706
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,760
That'll be all.

707
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,360
Walt.

708
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,860
Stay.

709
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,260
Put 'em through.

710
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,560
Go ahead, please.

711
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,960
Mr. President, this is Bill Buchanan.

712
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,160
I'm here with Jack Bauer.

713
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,520
Yes, Bill.

714
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,320
What do you have for me?

715
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,630
Sir, in the process of trying to track down this missing warhead, 

716
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,860
we brought a prime suspect in for questioning.

717
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,160
What have you learned?

718
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,560
Well, that's the problem, sir.

719
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,760
Right now, our hands are tied.

720
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,760
Amnesty Global has interceded on his behalf.

721
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
Interceded on what grounds?

722
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,260
He's a U.S. Citizen with no previous record.

723
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,060
Why is he a suspect?

724
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,770
We found him with Yosik Khatami, 

725
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,860
the man who's linked to today's terrorist events.

726
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,820
I don't understand.

727
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,260
It doesn't violate any law to question a suspect.

728
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,760
Mr. President, if I may...?

729
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,960
Go ahead, Mike.

730
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,860
Jack, it's Mike Novick.

731
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,660
Hi, Mike.

732
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,960
Am I correct in assuming that this suspect is unlikely

733
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,060
to respond to the kind of Q&A his lawyer would permit?

734
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:43,920
That's correct, Mike.

735
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,670
If we want to procure any information from this suspect, 

736
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,660
we're gonna have to do it behind closed doors.

737
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,420
You're talking about torturing this man?

738
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,250
I'm talking about doing what is necessary to

739
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,160
stop this warhead from being used against us.

740
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,060
Give us a moment, Bill.

741
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,660
Mike, what do you think?

742
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,260
I think we need to do whatever it takes to find Marwan.

743
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,160
Walt?

744
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,160
Weigh in.

745
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,460
Well, this makes me nervous.

746
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,860
Why?

747
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,160
Should this man be innocent, as he claims he is,

748
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,060
your first act as President is to sanction his torture.

749
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,060
Well, that'll...

750
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,860
that'll forever haunt your presidency.

751
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,860
Allright, gentalman

752
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,060
Here's what I'll agree to.

753
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,090
I'll call a special session with members of

754
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,360
the Justice Department and we'll discuss this.

755
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,820
I'll have an answer for you in 20 minutes.

756
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,760
Mr. President, this thing could be over in 20 minutes.

757
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,560
That's as far as I'm willing to go right now.

758
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,360
With all due respect, sir,

759
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,860
Please let us do our jobs.

760
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,960
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

761
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,560
I'll have Curtis start the interrogation of Prado.

762
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,460
You and I both know we can't afford to be wasting time like this.

763
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,020
You heard the President.

764
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,360
He's not going to let us touch this guy.

765
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,360
The President's not here- you are.

766
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,960
If I authorize this, they'll know in ten minutes.

767
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,960
We'll all be out the door.

768
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,740
What if I can find another way to handle this

769
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,260
that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me?

770
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,860
I'm not going to authorize that, Jack.

771
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,960
You don't have to.

772
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,460
What do you mean?

773
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,160
Accept my resignation.

774
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,160
And if I do that, what then?

775
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,460
Release the suspect.

776
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,820
Release him?

777
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,960
We don't question him, don't charge him, we just let him go.

778
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,460
He won't need a lawyer, or a marshal.

779
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,160
You're going to take him on as a private citizen.

780
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,060
Yes?

781
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,360
How far away are you?

782
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,660
92 miles.

783
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,760
When you get there, you'll meet with Morris.

784
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,460
Is he the one who's going to configure the detonation?

785
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,760
Yes.

786
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,260
I've given him the codes.

787
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,760
Okay.

788
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,760
You have to follow the plan exactly, Sabir.

789
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,060
We cannot give the americans time to start an evacuation.

790
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,760
Yes, Marwan. I understand.

791
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,260
No delays.

792
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,460
It'd be done.

793
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,460
Hey, when did you get back?

794
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,360
A few minutes ago.

795
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,860
Thanks.

796
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,620
Good.

797
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,360
I could use your help on the DOD interface.

798
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,160
I can't help you right now, Audrey. Sorry.

799
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,360
What are you doing?

800
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,760
I'll tell you when I get back.

801
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,460
Jack...

802
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,120
Jack!

803
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,060
Audrey, please.

804
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,560
What the hell are you trying to pull here?

805
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,960
First you want to torture me, and now you're throwing me out?

806
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:32,960
That's right.

807
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,820
It's okay, Joe.

808
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,680
I'm sure they tried to fight the restraining order, 

809
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,660
then realized they couldn't.

810
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,360
No, that's not what this is.

811
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,460
They're doing something.

812
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,260
Don't be so paranoid.

813
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,760
We're just not interested in you anymore.

814
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,520
I want protection when I get out of here.

815
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,460
The marshal can escort back wherever you want to go.

816
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,040
No, no, no!

817
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,060
You know what?

818
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,860
Change of plan!

819
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,110
I don't want to leave here 

820
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,660
until I know I'm safe for the next few days.

821
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
If you don't leave,

822
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,050
I'm going to have to arrest you for

823
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,660
trespassing in a secured government building.

824
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,360
Once that happens, not even your attorney can protect you.

825
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,060
Correct me if I'm wrong, David.

826
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,560
He's right.

827
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,460
What's going on?

828
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Where are they taking Prado?

829
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,460
He's been released.

830
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:28,860
Why?

831
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,620
I don't know.

832
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,760
It came from Buchanan.

833
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Mr. Buchanan, why are you letting him go?

834
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,020
Edgar, not now, please.

835
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,660
But he's working with the people that killed my mother.

836
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,360
Not now.

837
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,460
Cheer up, Joe, you're a free man.

838
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,760
Yeah, free.

839
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,460
The marshal's going to take you home.

840
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:48,820
No.

841
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,160
You kidding me? I can't go home.

842
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,160
I've got to go somewhere public, like a hotel.

843
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:52,820
Fine.

844
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,760
Tell him where you want to go.

845
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,760
Don't let anyone know you're there.

846
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,060
Here's my card.

847
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,760
You call me if anyone from CTU tries to bother you.

848
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,660
Yeah, okay.

849
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,760
You're going to be fine.

850
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,680
make a sound, and I will blow your brains out, 

851
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,760
all over the windshield.

852
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,660
Handcuff your left arm to the dashboard, now.

853
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,760
Now we're going to talk.

854
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,060
Now...

855
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,060
You and I both know your heart isn't in this.

856
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,160
You just wanted the money.

857
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
I don't want you.

858
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
All I want is Marwan.

859
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,920
I don't know any Marwan.

860
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

861
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,150
Yeah, well, I'm running out of time here, 

862
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,860
so why don't we just cut to the chase.

863
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,560
Where's Marwan?

864
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,760
I don't know!

865
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,560
Where is Marwan?!

866
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Where is Marwan?!

867
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,060
I don't know!

868
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,460
I swear I don't!

869
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,320
Okay, okay, okay, Marwan's...

870
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,860
Marwan's going to be at a place called the hub club tonight.

871
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,860
Where is it?

872
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,160
It's just...

873
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,080
It's just east...

874
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,670
Where is it?!

875
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,260
It's just east of downtown!

876
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,660
Just east of downtown.

877
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,260
This'll help you with the pain.

878
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


879
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,600
There's a convoy missing.

2
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,820
It was headed from Illinois to Jefferson City, Iowa.

3
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,630
It disappeared just inside the border.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,260
Disappeared?

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,310
They were due to call in at that checkpoint every 20 minutes.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,300
They didn't.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,790
I tried to reach them through comsat.

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,700
There was no reply.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,650
What was on the trucks?

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,300
A nuclear warhead.

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,760
They found us.

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,400
Where are you?

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,190
It doesn't matter.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:37,700
It's over.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,110
They already got us.

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,060
You have to kill Prado.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,350
He knows too much.

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,780
Drop the gun!

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,670
Drop the gun now!

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,530
Put the gun down!

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,320
Who are you?

22
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,430
My name's Joe Prado.

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,380
I'm innocent.

24
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,080
Mr. Prado's rights will not be violated.

25
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,350
Take me to him now.

26
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,540
We have no choice, Curtis.

27
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,360
Do what he says.

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,920
There's a nuclear warhead missing.

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,140
This is our only lead, Bill.

30
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,340
What the hell's going on here?

31
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,900
You've got a key witness on a missing warhead.

32
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,870
We should be pressing this guy with everything we've got.

33
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,410
Jack, it's Mike Novick.

34
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,370
Mike, if we want to procure any information from the

35
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,330
suspect, we're going to have to do it behind closed doors.

36
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,090
You're talking about torturing this man?

37
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm talking about doing what is necessary to

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,090
stop this warhead from being used against us.

39
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,670
All right, gentlemen, I'll have an answer for you in 20 minutes.

40
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,690
Mr. President, this thing could be over in 20 minutes.

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,740
What if I could find another way to handle

42
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,470
this that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me?

43
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,300
I'm not going to authorize that, Jack.

44
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,450
You don't have to.

45
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,750
What do you mean?

46
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,540
Accept my resignation.

47
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,210
And if I do that, what then?

48
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,540
Release the suspect.

49
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,970
Now you're throwing me out?

50
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,100
That's right.

51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,210
Make a sound and I will blow your brains out all over the windshield.

52
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,190
Where is he?!

53
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,220
I don't know!

54
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,220
Where is he now?!

55
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,610
Where's Marwan?!

56
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,430
Okay, okay, okay.

57
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,000
Marwan's...

58
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,800
Marwan's going to be at a place called the hub club tonight.

59
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,530
Where is it?

60
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:53,780
It's...

61
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,920
It's...

62
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,510
Where is it?!

63
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,110
It's just east of downtown!

64
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,400
This will help you with the pain.

65
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,510
The following takes place between 1:00 A.M. and 2:00 A.M.

66
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,900
Put me through to the White House.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,100
President Logan?

68
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
No, not the president.

69
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,860
Mike Novick.

70
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,800
One Moment Please.

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
I'm sorry we're trying to locate Mr. Novick.

72
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,400
Call me when you've got him on the line.

73
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes sir.

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,300
What happened?

75
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,300
Prado talked.

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,000
Who did this?

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,200
Audrey...

78
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm a representative of DOD.

79
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,300
I have a right to know, Bill.

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Did Jack do this?

81
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes, he did.

82
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,600
It was the only way to get him to give up Marwan's location.

83
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,800
So President Logan gave Jack the authority to use force?

84
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,500
No, Audrey, the president didn't.

85
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,100
Where's Jack now?

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
He's prepping a team to apprehend Marwan.

87
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,100
Curtis, Castle told me you want to utilize LAPD?

88
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,900
I'm having them lock down a ten-block perimeter.

89
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,100
I don't think that's the right call.

90
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,660
Marwan's people are coming and going.

91
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,800
We lock down that area, we just give them a heads up.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,560
All right. 

93
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,200
We'll stay invisible.

94
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Excuse me for one sec.

95
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,900
What is it?

96
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,200
I just came from the clinic where they're treating Prado for a multiple injuries?

97
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,400
Audrey, what do you expect me to do?

98
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Marwan has a nuclear warhead and he's going to use it, unless we find him first.

99
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,760
I understand the situation, Jack.

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Then you know what I did was absolutely necessary.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,300
At least now we know where he is.

102
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,970
Logan gave you a direct order not to use extreme

103
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,400
interrogation measures without his authorization.

104
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,600
Jack, you are acting against the president.

105
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,400
I know.

106
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,300
Jack, we're set.

107
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
I'll be right there.

108
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,900
All right, everyone, let's move out!

109
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,200
I've got to go.

110
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,700
Jack, you can't keep working outside the line and not expect consequences.

111
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,100
Trust me.

112
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
No one understands the consequences better than me.

113
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,400
- No one.  - Jack...

114
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,100
You okay?

115
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,600
Yeah, I'm fine.Why?

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,700
Just asking.

117
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,500
I'm fine.

119
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,500
Look, for whatever it's worth, you did the right thing with Prado.

120
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,300
Thanks.

121
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,240
Authorizing the torture of a foreign national is one thing, but

122
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,210
torturing a U.S.Citizen... I can't...

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,400
Sir,

124
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,100
this man Prado has information on the whereabouts of a nuclear warhead.

125
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,700
We don't know that for sure, Mike.

126
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,760
No, sir, we don't.

127
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
Because you're not letting CTU do what they need to do.

128
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,500
I want to wait till the attorney general gets back to me with an opinion.

129
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,000
Mr. President, we are running out of time.

130
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,500
Walt, you were the first one to raise an objection to this.

131
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
What do you think now?

132
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,700
I think you need to make a decision, sir.

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,700
And sooner rather than later.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Mr. Novick, Bill Buchanan's on the phone from CTU.

135
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,100
He's called twice. He said it's urgent.

136
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll be right there.

137
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,800
Yes.

138
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
What should I tell him?

139
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,870
Mr. President...?

140
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,200
Stop pressing me for an answer I'm not ready to give!

141
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,300
I need more time.

142
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,390
I'm sorry for the delay, Bill, but the

143
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,500
president is still working through his decision.

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,800
The president won't have to make that call, Mike.

145
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,100
What are you talking about?

146
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,200
Prado gave up Marwan's location.

147
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,500
I thought Prado claimed he didn't know anything.

148
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,700
He did.

149
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,000
He changed his mind.

150
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
You mean Bauer physically coerced him.

151
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,600
Tell me what happened, chapter and verse.

152
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,960
Mike, Bauer got the information we needed.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,100
I think it's best if I insulate you from the details.

154
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,050
The president gave explicit orders.

155
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,900
You should have restrained Bauer.

156
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,100
With all due respect, restraint is a luxury we can't afford right now.

157
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,400
What am I supposed to tell the president?

158
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,290
Convince him to sign off on the extreme interrogation,

159
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,600
and we'll cheat the timeline in the official record.

160
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,310
I made the mistake of deceiving one president,

161
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,000
I won't make the same mistake twice.

162
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Even though we both know Bauer was right?

163
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,600
Mike...

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,800
Someone out there has one of our nuclear warheads.

165
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,400
May I speak off the record?

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,900
Go ahead.

167
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,900
I'm worried about President Logan.

168
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,800
Worried?

169
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,400
Why?

170
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,500
His behavior over the last few hours...

171
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,900
I'm concerned about his ability to lead us through this crisis.

172
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,100
I understand.

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,750
Yes?

174
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,500
Where are you?

175
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,760
At the Iowa location.

176
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
We just arrived with the package.

177
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Has Sabir done the compatibility check?

178
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,450
Not yet.

179
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,800
Call me as soon as he's finished, and I'll have the next payment wired to your account.

180
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Is it compatible?

181
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,900
I'll need to reconfigure the trigger mechanism.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,300
Is it compatible?

183
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Yes.

184
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
How long will that take?

185
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,350
An hour.

186
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,100
Maybe less.

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Then you should start.

188
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,000
My girlfriend.

189
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
She'll leave a message.

190
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,060
She's already left three messages.

191
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,400
I don't want her calling around for me.

192
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
Take the call, but hurry up.

193
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,760
Nabila?

194
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,700
Where are you, Sabir?

195
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
It's the middle of the night.

196
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,800
I asked you where you are.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,950
At the hotel.

198
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,900
Stop lying to me.

199
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,460
I called.

200
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
You never checked in.

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Tell me what you're doing.

202
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,100
Nabila, I can't talk about this now.

203
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,700
Get some sleep, and I'll explain everything tomorrow.

204
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,400
You mean after you've had time to come up with another lie?

205
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,500
I found something on your computer, Sabir.

206
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,200
A bookmark.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,400
Do you have something to do with what's been happening today?

208
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,700
How can you ask that?

209
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,500
Are you working with these terrorists?

210
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,500
Of course not.

211
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,400
You know I'm not a violent man.

212
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,800
I know your politics.

213
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,760
Nabila, enough.

214
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Stop talking nonsense.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
Is it nonsense?

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,500
Like I said, I'll explain things tomorrow.

217
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,700
Sabir, listen to me.

218
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,000
She's fine.

219
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,100
Don't worry.

220
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,440
I want schematics on the nightclub, options for a

221
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,100
staging area, and let county know we need traffic control.

222
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,800
Thank you.

223
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,900
Bill, how could you let Jack torture Prado?

224
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,200
Audrey, it had to be done.

225
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
The president made it very clear that he didn't want Prado's rights violated.

226
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,200
That's right, he did make it clear, and he was wrong.

227
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,820
We can't just break protocol because we think it's

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,800
right at the time and expect to get away with it.

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,950
Normally, I'd agree with you, but in this case,

230
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,900
I'd rather ask for forgiveness than permission.

231
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,300
What kind of answer is that?

232
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,100
The answer is it worked.

233
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,700
We got Marwan's location.

234
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,000
Audrey, will all due respect, this is not Washington, D.C.

235
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Policy and politics do not always work on the front line, which is where we are today.

236
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,500
Yes, well, Charles Logan is a politician, and he is not going to give you forgiveness.

237
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,700
I hope this does not come back to haunt you or Jack.

238
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,900
If what we did gets us to Marwan, we'll live with it.

239
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,500
What is it?

240
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,300
CTU located Marwan.

241
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
They've sent a tactical team to grab him.

242
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
That's good news.

243
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,800
But I'm curious how they obtained Marwan's location.

244
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,500
Did they use force?

245
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,290
Yes, sir, I believe force was used, but I'm sure I don't need

246
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,900
to remind you that this is an extremely time-sensitive situation.

247
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,000
Who's responsible, Mike?

248
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm asking you a question, Mike.

249
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,700
Who did this?

250
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,200
Jack Bauer.

251
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,300
I'm the President of the United States!

252
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,620
I can't allow this kind of insubordination to

253
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,800
go unanswered, especially in a time of crisis!

254
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
I want Bauer arrested.

255
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,500
I agree that that should happen, sir, but I think

256
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,000
we should wait until we have Marwan in custody.

257
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,100
No, I want him arrested now.

258
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,400
Sir, Bauer is heading the field operation.

259
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,100
Jack Bauer is not the only man that can do the job!

260
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,100
Put someone else in charge!

261
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,100
Mr. President...

262
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,450
Get me Secret Service!

263
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,700
Yes, Mr. President.

264
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
Has Jack set the robotic camera in position?

265
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,400
It should be ready in a few minutes.

266
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,500
We're set to receive.

267
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,300
Thanks, Curtis.

268
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,200
Get this to Audrey Raines and have her stream it to DOD, please.

269
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,000
Buchanan.

270
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,160
Bill, it's Mike Novick.

271
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,900
I just got out of a room with president Logan.

272
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,700
He knows how we got the information from Prado.

273
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,200
How did he find that out?

274
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,500
He's not a stupid man, Bill, and I'm not going to lie to him.

275
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,600
Well, you'll just have to convince him to leave it alone then.

276
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,460
I tried.

277
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,000
He's not going to leave it alone.

278
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,100
Fine.

279
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,860
Tomorrow he can bring charges against me.

280
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,100
Right now, I have to get back to the business of finding Marwan.

281
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,500
It's not tomorrow and it's not you.

282
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,800
What does that mean?

283
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,000
He wants Jack Bauer arrested.

284
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,100
Arrested?!

285
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,000
Mike...

286
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Jack is heading up the team that's trying to bring in Marwan.

287
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,900
We're aware of that.

288
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,460
Logan's adamant.

289
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
He wants this dealt with immediately.

290
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,200
Anything less he will take as a personal repudiation of his presidency.

291
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,880
Okay, what's more important, the president's feelings or capturing

292
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,400
the man who's responsible for everything that's happened today?!

293
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,000
I hear what you're saying, Bill, but Logan's already called the Secret Service.

294
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,300
They're on their way to take Jack into custody.

295
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,300
I suggest you warn him immediately.

296
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,200
Before we move in, we need confirmation Marwan's inside.

297
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,600
I'll send in the remote camera, see if we can get a visual.

298
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,800
What's your point of entry?

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,100
Ventilation shaft.

300
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,260
Chloe, it's Jack.

301
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,400
Can you get the schematics for the AC configuration

302
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,100
for the building, send it over to my PDA?

303
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,860
I'm on it, Jack.

304
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,500
I'll send it to you as soon as I can.

305
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,500
Okay.

306
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,300
The camera's working.

307
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,700
O'Brian.

308
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,000
We've got a Los Angeles woman reporting suspicious activities.

309
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
First Tier wants it kicked up to you.

310
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,300
Cross reference and I.D. match?

311
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,400
She seems to be who she says she is.

312
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,300
Okay, send her information to my screen and put her through.

313
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,300
Here you go.

314
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,060
This is Chloe O'Brian, how can I help you?

315
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,900
I was just telling the man on the phone, I'm not sure who exactly I should be talking to.

316
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,250
I'm an analyst at CTU Los Angeles.

317
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,700
Why don't you start at the beginning?

318
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,900
I'm calling about my boyfriend.

319
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,200
What's his name?

320
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,600
You need to understand, I'm not sure if this means anything.

321
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,000
You were about to tell me his name.

322
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,300
Sabir Ardakani.

323
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,100
We've been going out since grad school.

324
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,300
Can you spell that?

325
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,600
S-a-b-i-r A-r-d-a-k-a-n-i.

326
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Where'd you go to grad school?

327
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,700
Berkeley Tech.

328
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,800
We were both studying engineering.

329
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
He's been traveling a lot lately, "business trips", he said.

330
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,980
I'm not sure why I looked, probably because of everything that's been going on today,

331
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
but I found something on his computer.

332
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Tell me.

333
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,500
I think Sabir may have become involved with...

334
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,400
radical groups.

335
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,200
You mean terrorists?

336
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,800
Yes.

337
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Where is Sabir now?

338
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,400
He said he was going to Arizona for a client meeting, but the hotel has no record of him.

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
When you looked through his computer files, tell me what you found specifically.

340
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,680
Most of his files are encrypted, but there was one document

341
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,000
in the recycle bin that's a schematic for a microchip...

342
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
A type I've never seen before.

343
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,800
Jack, do you copy?

344
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,900
Yeah.

345
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
Buchanan wants to talk to you.

346
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,700
Now?

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,900
He says it's urgent.

348
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,100
Fine.

349
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,200
Go ahead, Bill.

350
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,600
Jack, we've got a problem.

351
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,800
Secret Service is on their way over there now to arrest you.

352
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,100
What are you talking about?

353
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,200
Logan knows we violated his order when you after Prado.

354
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
Bill, they can't interrupt this mission.

355
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,760
You got to stall them.

356
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,300
Jack, I've been on the phone for the last ten minutes.

357
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,800
There's nothing I can do from here.

358
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,900
You have to get Marwan before secret service gets there.

359
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Curtis, did you copy that?

360
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

361
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,700
I'll run interference.

362
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Give me a couple minutes.

363
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,800
I'll be ready to transmit.

364
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,200
Yes, we're ready.

365
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,600
Excuse me, Marwan.

366
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,300
I just talked to Abat in New York.

367
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,400
As soon as you're done, I'll upload the tape.

368
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,500
Good.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
I want this delivered to television stations by dawn on the east coast.

370
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,600
That won't be a problem.

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,900
Do you want to cover your face?

372
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,400
No.

373
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,800
I want the American people to know who did this.

374
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,400
Ready.

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,600
People of America, you wake up today to a different world.

376
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,100
One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you.

377
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,300
It'll be days and weeks before you can measure the damage we have caused.

378
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,100
But as you count your dead, remember why this has happened to you.

379
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,260
You have no understanding for the causes of the

380
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,100
people you strike down or the nations you conquer.

381
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,700
You choose to meddle in their affairs without respect.

382
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,300
You follow your government, unquestioning, toward your own slaughter.

383
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Today you'll pay the price for that ignorance.

384
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,000
I have camera in the vent.

385
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,100
I've got a visual on the main room.

386
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,760
Approximately 50 civilians.

387
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Marwan won't be here, he's going to want to stay out of sight.

388
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Hold on, I've got a possible sentry...

389
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,700
and a second possible sentry at the window, looking down on the street.

390
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,500
Michelle, can you get a frame grab?

391
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
We're working on an I.D.

392
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,100
Sending a freeze frame to the facial recognition software.

393
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,700
Jack, we have a match.

394
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,100
He's a known associate of Marwan.

395
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,800
That confirms that Prado gave us a legitimate address.

396
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,500
But not that Marwan is in the building.

397
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,900
We can't risk exposing ourselves till we know he's in there.

398
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,000
Castle.

399
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Secret service is approaching your position.

400
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
Jack, secret service has arrived.

401
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,300
Did Marwan's people see them approach?

402
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,860
No.

403
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,300
They came up through the rear alley.

404
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,000
Moving on to the next room.

405
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,300
Unless you renounce your policies of imperialism and interventionist activities,

406
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,600
this attack will be followed by another,

407
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,700
and another after that...

408
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,300
I've got a visual on people in the storage room.

409
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,200
How many?

410
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,300
Five.

411
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,000
But they're talking to someone outside my sight line.

412
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,960
I got it.

413
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
All right, stand by, Jack.

414
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,700
What's going on?

415
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,360
Secret Service.

416
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,600
I'm Agent Greg Merfield, this is Agent Frank Wells.

417
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,290
We know this is a highly irregular situation, but

418
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,500
we have orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.

419
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,600
Curtis, let me talk to them.

420
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,950
Go ahead, Jack.

421
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,400
This is Jack Bauer.

422
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,400
Right now we are trying to confirm that Habib Marwan is in this building.

423
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,450
He is a terrorist in possession of a stolen nuclear warhead.

424
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,200
I cannot impress upon you how sensitive this mission is.

425
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,050
The president was specific, sir.

426
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,400
We need to pull you off this now.

427
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,100
I don't think you understand.

428
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,360
I am in a concealed position.

429
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,300
You pull me out now, you put this whole operation in jeopardy.

430
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,400
As soon as this is over, I give you my word I will go with you.

431
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm sorry, agent, if you don't come out, we're going to have to come in and get you.

432
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,500
Local secret service command has confirmed the order, Jack.

433
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,600
There's nothing I can do about it here.

434
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,000
Jack, we don't have a choice.

435
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,600
We're going to need to replace you.

436
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,950
Jack, this is Castle.

437
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm heading out to you.

438
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,560
Fine.

439
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,000
Approach the south side of the building.

440
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,300
Got it.

441
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,000
Curtis, we're on the move.

442
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,300
All right, be careful.

443
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Marwan, the police are here.

444
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,100
Nasir saw an officer outside.

445
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,500
Start packing.

446
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,700
Hold on, I got a visual on Marwan.

447
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,350
I have a visual on Marwan.

448
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,500
He is in the building.

449
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,550
Damn it, they know we're here.

450
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,600
Everybody move on the building.

451
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,300
Our cover's blown!

452
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:51,860
Everyone, go!

453
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,600
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!...

454
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,360
Down!

455
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,200
Down! Down! Down!

456
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,410
Everybody, get down!

457
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,600
Down! Down! Down!

458
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,000
Freeze!

459
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,100
Hostile down.

460
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,800
I got him, Jack.

461
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Marwan and his men have escaped through a hole in the outer basement wall.

462
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,300
Set up a two-mile perimeter, cover all utility access points.

463
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,000
Bomb!

464
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,500
Bomb! Go!

465
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,400
Jack, what happened?

466
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,000
Curtis! Curtis...

467
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,600
Jack, do you read me?

468
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,800
Jack, you okay?

469
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,400
Yeah.

470
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,700
Check on the men.

471
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,000
Michelle, it's Jack.

472
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,800
We can't pursue, they blew the tunnel up behind them.

473
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,100
It's completely blocked.

474
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,500
Have LAPD tighten up the perimeter.

475
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Get them to tell us what this tunnel feeds into now.

476
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,200
Yeah.

477
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,700
Jack...

478
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,600
Agent Bauer...

479
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,850
Agent Merfield.

480
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,560
Secret Service.

481
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,400
I'm sorry, but I'm here to take you into custody

482
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,900
Hand over your weapon.

483
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
You blew this mission.

484
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,400
I'm sorry, sir, I'm just following orders.

485
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,140
Has anyone asked President Logan?

486
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,200
What the hell he was thinking, arresting Jack in the middle of the operation?

487
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Look, Curtis, we still have to focus on finding Marwan.

488
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
We pulled up city records.

489
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,700
The building is directly adjacent to a sewer line.

490
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,800
How many street-level egress points are there?

491
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,670
At least 30.

492
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,800
Which means Marwan's probably gotten past our perimeters already.

493
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,300
Yeah, well, we still have to keep looking.

494
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,110
LAPD and FBI will set down a grid down there.

495
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,900
I want you to coordinate your men with them.

496
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,500
We just found a videotape on the man we shot.

497
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,200
It's been damaged, but we should be able to recover most of what's on it.

498
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,800
Well, have one of your men come back here with the videotape.

499
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,350
Edgar's repositioned the satellite.

500
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,600
We'll let you know if we find anything.

501
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,300
You got it.

502
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,600
How did Marwan get past your men?

503
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,500
They had to move in before they were ready.

504
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,800
Why?

505
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,740
Secret Service showed up to take Bauer into

506
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,900
custody, which compromised one of our positions.

507
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,400
I didn't mean...

508
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,700
that's not what I meant to have happen.

509
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
With respect, sir...

510
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,500
your orders were explicit.

511
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
What other search protocols are you running?

512
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,860
None, Mr. Novick.

513
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,100
We're essentially without a lead.

514
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,300
Bill, give us a few minutes.

515
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
We'll get right back to you.

516
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Standing by.

517
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,200
This is not my fault.

518
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
None of this would have happened if Jack Bauer

519
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
hadn't disobeyed my orders in the first place.

520
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Sorry, sir, but if you're asking me to agree with that assessment, I can't.

521
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,500
If it wasn't for Jack, we won't locate Marwan.

522
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,700
CTU is waiting for us to call them back with a directive.

523
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,100
What would you like me to tell them, Mr. President?

524
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,800
I have no idea.

525
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
And that's the problem, isn't it?

526
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,100
It is my fault we lost him.

527
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,100
This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead, and I allowed him to escape.

528
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,900
Mr. President...

529
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,500
Stop.

530
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,600
I don't even know if I deserve to be called that.

531
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,400
Whatever I call you won't change the fact... you are president of the united states.

532
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
I shouldn't be.

533
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,500
For the good of this country, I should resign.

534
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,800
That's not an option, sir.

535
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,100
Not without destroying the public's confidence, which is already at its limits.

536
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,400
Three presidents in as many hours would be devastating.

537
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,000
Then what should I do, Mike?

538
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,800
Tell me what to do.

539
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,400
There's someone who can advise you better than I can.

540
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,100
You should consider bringing him in here to help you through this.

541
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,600
Who?

542
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
President Keeler is in critical condition after Air

543
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Force One crashed in the Mojave desert a few hours ago.

544
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,720
A white house spokesperson reports that the president was

545
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,800
taken to an undisclosed military hospital following the crash.

546
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,900
Sir, there's a secure call coming through for you.

547
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Thank you, Adam.

548
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Hello.

549
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,980
Mr. President...

550
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,570
Mike?

551
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,900
Yes, sir.

552
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm sorry to disturb you so late.

553
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,600
I've been up all night following the news.

554
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,900
This is a tragic day for our country.

555
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Yes.

556
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
May I ask when you received your last intelligence briefing?

557
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Three hours ago, why?

558
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,500
Since then, the terrorist behind today's events, Habib Marwan,

559
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,700
has taken possession of a nuclear warhead.

560
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,300
My god.

561
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,700
How?

562
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,800
Well, he recovered the football from the wreckage of Air Force One,

563
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,300
and he used it to track and steal the warhead.

564
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,000
President Logan feels he needs help.

565
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,860
What kind of help?

566
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,100
Substantial.

567
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,700
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

568
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,400
President Logan is requesting that you run the effort to recover the stolen weapon

569
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,300
and be in place to make whatever decisions need to be made.

570
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,500
A crisis is looming.

571
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,000
Hard choices may need to be made, and by the president's own admission...

572
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,800
he feels he may not be up to the task.

573
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:35,600
This country is very possibly about to face the worst terrorist act in its history.

574
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,500
We need your leadership.

575
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,500
Before I do anything,

576
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,900
I want to speak to President Logan face-to-face.

577
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,500
Fair enough.

578
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,400
We'll notify your secret service detail to bring you to the White House.

579
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,300
All right, Mike.

580
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,500
Thank you, Mr. President.

581
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,800
Please step out of the car, Agent Bauer.

582
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,000
What's going on?

583
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,800
President Logan realized this was a mistake.

584
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,900
You're free to go.

585
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,900
I am genuinely sorry about all this.

586
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,900
Doesn't really help us with our situation, does it?

587
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,400
We had Marwan.

588
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,000
Any sign of him?

589
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,300
We have people all over the tunnels.

590
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,200
So far, nothing.

591
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,100
We had him.

592
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,700
Damn it!

593
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,260
We had him.

594
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,660
They're not finished searching the tunnels.

595
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,100
If you haven't found him yet, you're not going to.

596
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,600
Too many ways in, too many ways out.

597
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,800
CTU have any new leads on Marwan or the warhead?

598
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,400
No.

599
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,100
Great.

600
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,760
Load everybody up.

601
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
We're going back to CTU now.

602
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,700
All right, everyone, let's go.

603
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,800
Edgar...

604
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm busy, Chloe.

605
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,100
I need you to release your system.

606
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,500
Why?

607
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
It's the only one with a random sequencer.

608
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
You're gonna have to wait.

609
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,160
I can't wait-- someone called a lead in.

610
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,500
And now that Marwan's escaped, I need to pursue this.

611
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,260
This is more important.

612
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,800
I have agents out there looking for Marwan.

613
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I need to reconfigure the perimeter for them.

614
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,760
You don't need your system to do that.

615
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,100
Just tell them to use the profiles we loaded onto their panels.

616
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,060
That won't be good enough. 

617
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,300
Things are changing every minute.

618
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,000
They're field agents, they have guns.

619
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,300
They don't need you to coddle them.

620
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,200
You know, that's a pretty rude attitude.

621
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,600
I need your system.

622
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,100
No.

623
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,100
Tony.

624
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,600
What?

625
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,110
A woman called in, and she thinks her boyfriend may

626
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,100
have had something to do with today's terrorist attacks.

627
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,100
Did you verify it?

628
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,060
No, that's the problem.

629
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,500
I need to use Edgar's system.

630
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,800
Why?

631
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,900
Her evidence involves data that she got from her boyfriend's computer.

632
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,100
It's in proprietary format.

633
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,900
Well, what's Edgar doing?

634
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,900
He's screwing around, moving agents that Jack and Curtis don't need.

635
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,300
Edgar.

636
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,500
Yeah?

637
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,400
Let Chloe into your system.

638
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
What about tactical I'm running?

639
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,100
I still got guys out there.

640
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,160
Marwan's long gone.

641
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,600
Most of those agents you can call back in.

642
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,500
Excuse me.

643
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,500
Fine.

644
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,500
Yes?

645
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,400
This is Morrison.

646
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,060
Is there a problem?

647
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
I haven't heard from you.

648
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,600
CTU found the club.

649
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,800
How'd they know you were there?

650
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,300
Must have been Prado.

651
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,800
Has the warhead been reconfigured?

652
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Yes.

653
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Then our timetable remains unchanged.

654
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,700
Marwan...

655
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,100
we, uh, may have a potential security breach here.

656
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,500
Who?

657
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,100
The technician, Sabir.

658
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,700
His girlfriend's getting suspicious.

659
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,600
But it's being taken care of?

660
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,800
Of course.

661
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,000
It's been handled.

662
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Let me know when it's done.

663
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,400
Tony.

664
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,200
Yeah?

665
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,200
The woman with the phone tip who was suspicious about her boyfriend panned out.

666
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,300
What'd you find?

667
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
She sent us a schematic of a microchip that we did analysis on.

668
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,500
It's used exclusively in legacy nuclear warheads.

669
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,300
Does this include the warhead Marwan has control of?

670
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,200
Yes, this is the design of the chip that controls the trigger on the stolen warhead.

671
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,700
What do we know about the man whose computer we found this on?

672
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,400
His name is Sabir Ardakani.

673
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,000
According to his girlfriend, he's recently become radicalized.

674
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,460
I want his picture and I.D.

675
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,700
On an all-agency distribution list, highest priority.

676
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,800
She thinks he's out of state, but she has no idea where.

677
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,560
Well, if he's in this with Marwan, he's probably

678
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,200
somewhere in the Iowa region, with the warhead.

679
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,900
This woman who gave you the tip, is she local?

680
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,360
Yes.

681
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,960
Los Feliz.

682
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,200
She says that the rest of the files on his hard drive are locked.

683
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,800
If that's the case, we're going to need a specialist.

684
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,080
We're going to need to send a team over there as soon

685
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,700
as possible and see what else we can dig up on him.

686
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,400
All right.

687
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Chloe, I want you over there.

688
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,660
What?

689
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,000
Take a team with you, let's get on this.

690
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,700
Oh, I'm not a field agent.

691
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,500
I don't do that.

692
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,300
Chloe?

693
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,260
We need a specialist on this.

694
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,600
You're the only one who can get those files off that hard drive.

695
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,400
I want to know what Ardakani's doing and where he is.

696
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,580
Chloe...

697
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm giving you an order... go.

698
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,890
Edgar, this is Chloe.

699
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,800
Does my panel have a live link to the tactical network?

700
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,000
Not yet.

701
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,200
What are you waiting for?

702
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,100
We don't do that until the agent's on site.

703
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,200
I'm not an agent.

704
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,200
I know that, but you're attached to a mobile unit, Chloe.

705
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,700
I'm just trying to do things by the book.

706
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,100
Isn't always what you tell me to do?

707
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,450
Why do you have to be so contrary?

708
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,560
I'm just not comfortable out here.

709
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,000
I want to make sure you have everything covered.

710
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,100
Fine, you have your live link.

711
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:29,700
What else?

712
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,900
Trunk my audio in with Bergen and White.

713
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,200
I want to make sure that I can monitor two-way between them and CTU.

714
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,000
Done.

715
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,900
Okay, I can't think of anything else right now,

716
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,460
but if I do, I'm going to call you,

717
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,000
and I really hope you don't give me so much resistance next time.

718
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,100
Chloe, I know you're scared, and I'll make sure everything is covered on this end.

719
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,200
Why did they ask me to do this?

720
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,000
I really hate it.

721
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,300
While you were prepping, I asked Buchanan if I can go instead of you.

722
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,300
He wouldn't let me.

723
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,700
He said you were the best analyst we have.

724
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,200
He's right.

725
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,890
I know.

726
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
I'll call you if I can think of anything else.

727
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,500
Okay.

728
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,500
Hi.

729
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,900
I'm Agent O'Brian, these are agents Bergen and White.

730
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,700
You're Nabila Al-Jamil?

731
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,400
Yes.

732
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,200
Where's the computer?

733
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,000
Please, come in.

734
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,300
These men need to search the house.

735
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,900
Did Mr. Ardakani keep records other than on his computer?

736
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,400
There are some papers in the bedroom.

737
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
This is the computer you found the chip schematic on?

738
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,120
Yes, but like I told your people on the phone, the rest of his files are encrypted.

739
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,800
Are you sure?

740
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,300
Yes, I ran a check sum and built a subroutine to confirm.

741
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,300
I have a doctorate in computer sciences.

742
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,900
Okay, let's see...

743
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,360
You're right.

744
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,900
They used blowfish algorithm.

745
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,700
How can you tell?

746
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,600
By the tab on the file headers.

747
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Can you decrypt it?

748
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,500
CTU has a proprietary algorithm.

749
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,800
It shouldn't take that long.

750
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,000
We'll start by trying to hack the password.

751
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Let's start with the basics.

752
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,700
Write down nicknames, birthdays, pets... anything you think he might have used.

753
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,700
Okay.

754
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:28,980
What was that?

755
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,400
I don't know

756
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,300
Go!

757
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,500
Go!

758
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,100
In here.

759
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,300
Your men are dead.

760
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,300
Open the door.

761
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,100
Don't you have a gun?

762
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,300
I work with computers.

763
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,300
Open the door.

764
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,360
Edgar Stiles.

765
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,150
Edgar, it's Chloe.

766
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,040
This is an emergency.

767
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,900
We're being shot at!

768
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,300
Where are you?

769
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,900
The Los Feliz location.

770
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:01,460
We need help!

771
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,300
Okay, all right...

772
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,800
Jack, Curtis, Chloe's in the field.

773
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,500
She's under fire.

774
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,360
What's her location?

775
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,100
1482 Franklin, Los Feliz.

776
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,100
Curtis, how far out are the closest tac teams?

777
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,700
I'm on it.

778
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,260
Chloe, it's Jack.

779
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,300
What's your situation.

780
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,000
I barricaded us in the laundry room.

781
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,100
Who are you with?

782
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,760
Our informant.

783
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Bergen and White were with me.

784
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,700
Bergen's down, I don't know where White is.

785
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,700
I'll call you back.

786
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,000
Chloe, don't hang up the phone.

787
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,700
Get her back on the line now.

788
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,400
Hurry.

789
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,960
This is Jack Bauer.

790
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
I need an LAPD response at 1482 Franklin.

791
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,800
We have two agents down, one under fire.

792
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Where are the tac teams?

793
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,600
About 15 minutes.

794
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,200
That's too long.

795
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,800
Be open, be open...

796
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,700
where are the keys?

797
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,700
where are the keys?

798
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,500
where are the keys?

799
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,500
Jack, it's her!

800
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,000
Put her on speaker.

801
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,500
Jack, how far away is help?

802
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,600
At least ten minutes.

803
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,000
Ten minutes is too long.

804
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,450
Chloe, just try to stay calm.

805
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,500
Tell me where you are now.

806
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,300
He's shooting at us!

807
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,360
The glass is bulletproof.

808
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,100
Chloe, I need you to tell me where you are.

809
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,600
We're in a CTU car.

810
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,400
He's shooting at us from outside.

811
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,400
I don't have the keys. Can I hot-wire this?

812
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,960
No, it's secured.

813
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,700
But there should be weapons stored inside the vehicle.

814
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,800
There's a rifle in the back.

815
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,260
It's locked.

816
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,600
I need the combination.

817
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,400
I'm on it.

818
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,700
Chloe?

819
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,850
Where's going?

820
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,300
Wait, I think he's leaving.

821
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
We got the combination?

822
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,600
Not yet.

823
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,400
He's going to ram us!

824
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh, god!

825
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,200
What's taking so long, Jack?!

826
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,200
I've got it!

827
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,200
It's 3-1-4-3!

828
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,400
Chloe, did you get that?!

829
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,260
3-1...

830
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,700
What's going on here?

831
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,800
What's doing?!

832
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,890
Go, get out!

833
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,690
Get out, get out!

834
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


835
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,820
- I want Bauer arrested.  - Bauer is heading the field operation.

2
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,770
Jack Bauer is not the only man who can do the job! Put someone else in charge!

3
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,230
Jack, we got a problem. Secret Service is on their way to arrest you.

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,990
Bill, we can't interrupt this mission. You gotta stall 'em.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,700
Nothing I can do here. Get Marwan before Secret Service gets there.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,750
People of America, you wake up today to a different world.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,510
I have a visual on Marwan. He is in the building.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,310
- Dammit, they know we're here. Move on the building.  - Our cover's blown. Everyone, go, go, go, go!

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,700
Bomb!

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,590
President Logan realized this was a mistake. You're free to go.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,630
We had Marwan.

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,150
Dammit, we had him!

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,870
This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead and I allowed him to escape.

14
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,230
- Mr. President...  - Stop.

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,780
I don't even know if I deserve to be called that.

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,990
There's someone who can advise you better than I can.

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,890
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,830
President Logan is requesting you run the effort to recover the stolen weapon

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,870
and be in place to make whatever decisions need to be made.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,530
- Is it compatible?  - I'll need to reconfigure the trigger mechanism.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,490
- Has the warhead been reconfigured?  - Yes.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,350
- We may have a potential security breach.  - Who?

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,890
The technician, Sabir. His girlfriend's getting suspicious.

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,230
I think Sabir may have become involved with radical groups.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,750
- You mean terrorists?  - Yes.

26
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,690
The woman who was suspicious about her boyfriend panned out.

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,150
She sent us a schematic of a microchip. It's used exclusively in legacy nuclear warheads.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,590
Take a team with you. Let's go.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,590
What was that?

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,710
He's gonna ram us!

31
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,350
- Good to have you back, Mr. President.  - Than you, Aaron.

32
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,230
- This way, sir.  - President Logan's not in the West Wing?

33
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,990
No, sir. Since the strike on Air Force One, he's been in the bunker.

34
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,750
- How's your son?  - Very well, sir. Thank you for asking.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,910
- Still in the service?  - Yes. In fact, he just re-upped.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,900
- Good for him.  - I'm mighty proud.

37
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,540
Mr. President. Thank you for coming.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,590
- Is there an update on President Keeler?  - No, he's still comatose.

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,810
- The long-term prognosis is still unclear?  - Yes.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,950
- How's President Logan?  - Looking forward to seeing you.

41
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,030
Thank you, Eric.

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,870
President Logan.

43
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,710
David. I appreciate your coming so quickly.

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,350
Tell me how I can help you.

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,950
David, I wasn't prepared to have all of this thrust upon me so suddenly.

46
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,990
What I'm trying to say is, I made mistakes. This crisis could have ended an hour ago

47
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,470
if I hadn't interfered with the CTU operation that would have captured Habib Marwan.

48
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,550
Punishing yourself is something you can't afford now.

49
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,070
What I can't afford and what this country can't afford is another mistake.

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,130
Every decision I make affects millions of Americans.

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,750
- I understand the pressure you're under.  - I know you do.

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,740
In office, you dealt with this kind of situation more than once. That's why I want you here.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,550
I still don't understand what it is I can do to help you.

54
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,630
Sit.

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,830
The warhead that was stolen is an S-series.

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,630
That's one of the most powerful nuclear weapons in the arsenal.

57
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,430
Wherever it's detonated, it will wreak unthinkable devastation.

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,590
Help me find it. 

59
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,970
I'll give you full authority to act as my proxy whenever you think it's necessary.

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,670
Charles, how do you want this to work?

61
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:53,440
I'll call Bill Buchanan at CTU, and I'II let him know that he'll be dealing directly with you.

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,870
All right.

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,710
Thank you, David. Mike will fill you in.

64
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,870
We will get through this, Mr. President.

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,870
Um, I'll be, uh, in conference room B,

66
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,720
working on the morning statement for the press.

67
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,850
I'll keep you apprised of any developments, sir.

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,910
Thank you, Mike.

69
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,870
Mr. President. I know you believe my actions during your term in office

70
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,030
amounted to a personal and political betrayal.

71
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,110
That's not something I believe.

72
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,470
It's a fact. Get to your point.

73
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,550
If my presence here makes it more difficult for you, say the word and I'II leave.

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,630
Mike, you're wired into this administration.

75
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,630
And I have no doubt that you have this country's best interests at heart.

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,610
So for now, let's let bygones be bygones and get to work.

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,950
Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate that.

78
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,150
I reviewed the briefing on the way here.

79
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,810
Have army reserves supplement the search teams looking for the warhead in Iowa.

80
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,540
And have DOE and DOD coordinating on crisis response in case it's detonated.

81
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,870
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,770
CTU is heading up the search for this man who stole the warhead, Habib Marwan?

83
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,470
Yes, they recovered a damaged video tape from Marwan's last known location.

84
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,530
They're in the process of restoring it.

85
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,490
But Marwan is not CTU's only lead on the warhead now.

86
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,470
- What else do they have?  - A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,450
secured a hard drive belonging to one of Marwan's associates.

88
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,890
This hard drive may contain information that could lead us to the warhead.

89
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,860
I told you, I'm not hurt. I did the shooting. Now please leave me alone so I can do this.

90
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,550
Ok, the hard drive is unlocked.

91
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,950
It belonged to someone who had no experience of nuclear weapons.

92
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,830
- He got that information from someone.  - The emails I'm decrypting look like that.

93
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,470
Schematics, designs of triggers,

94
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,850
- all from the same person.  - Who?

95
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,710
The address is shielded under a false domain name.

96
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,990
- What is it?  - MEM4FT.

97
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,750
- Ok, Chloe, I want you forward the emails to us. Edgar?  - I'll run a trace to find a point of origin.

98
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,730
These emails came from a domestic server. Whoever sent this is in this country.

99
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,970
OK, Chloe, thank you. Hold on.

100
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,230
Hey. How are you holding up?

101
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,290
I'm not used to the idea that I just killed someone, but I'm doing my job.

102
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,670
Fair enough. Get back as soon as you can, OK?

103
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,350
OK.

104
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,770
I got a hit. The man who sent the emails. Name is Lee Jong.

105
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,460
- Is he in our database?  - He's a Chinese national.

106
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,970
A researcher at China's nuclear weapons programme.

107
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,100
He was accused of falsifying research data and fired in 2001.

108
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,870
Is China providing Marwan with support for this?

109
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,890
Chinese wouldn't use someone that could be traced to them so easily.

110
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,440
He's selling his services as a freelancer.

111
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,240
If he's helping Marwan reconfigure the warhead,  most likely he'll know how to find him.

112
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,490
See if Lee entered the country last week.

113
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,950
Excuse me. This is Bauer.

114
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,310
Jack? Dr Besson. You wanted me to give you an update on Paul Raines.

115
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,220
He's still in recovery, but you can see him now. Just a few minutes.

116
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,990
Thank you doctor. Get back to me if you find anything.

117
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,430
- Where can I find you?  - I'll be in Medical.

118
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,830
Hey.

119
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,830
Dr Besson wants to move you to Amherst General,

120
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,680
but the FAA still has a ban on air travel.

121
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,510
I am trying to get you an exemption.

122
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,950
Well, if anyone can get an exemption, you can.

123
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,030
Listen.

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,740
I've thought a lot about this, and I want to go with you to Massachusetts.

125
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,790
- With me?  - Yeah.

126
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,630
You need to get better, and you shouldn't have to do that alone.

127
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,910
I can take care of myself. I don't need your charity.

128
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,590
It's not about charity, Paul, it's what I want to do.

129
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,790
What about Jack?

130
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,260
You said you were in love with him.

131
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,110
I know.

132
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,890
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

133
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,430
- I'll come back later.  - No, it's all right. Come in.

134
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,550
I thought you'd be at the DOD briefing.

135
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,150
- Yeah, it ended early.  - Oh.

136
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,210
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

137
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,670
I've been trying to get down here since you got out of surgery.

138
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,850
- Listen, Paul...  - You don't have to say anything.

139
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,790
Yeah, I do. You saved my life.

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,990
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's all.

141
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,300
- You pushed me out of the way.  - Honestly, I wasn't even thinking.

142
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,830
And it just happened.

143
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,350
Paul, Are you OK?

144
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,580
I'll check back on you later.

145
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,270
Does he know that you want to come with me?

146
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,210
Not yet.

147
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,630
- What is it?  - We found Lee Jong. 

148
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,730
- Where is he?  - Chinese consulate.

149
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,810
He must have known we were coming. He took refuge.

150
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,790
He got there an hour ago. Consulate's sovereign territory, we can't get him.

151
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,410
But we're gonna try. David Palmer for you.

152
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,670
David Palmer?

153
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,730
Frankly, Logan's been overwhelmed by what's happening.

154
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,740
- He enlisted Palmer to help us directly.  - Good.

155
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,740
- This is Bauer.  - Hold for the president.

156
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,990
- Sir.  - Thank you, Mike.

157
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,830
- It's nice to talk to you again, Jack.  - It's nice to talk to you too, Mr. President.

158
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,950
I assume Bill told you about Lee Jong?

159
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,900
Yes, sir.

160
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm about to call the Chinese consul and explain the situation.

161
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,730
I'd like it if you took Lee into custody and brought him to CTU for interrogation.

162
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,870
- You think the consul will cooperate?  - He's reasonable.

163
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,310
And if the protocol approach doesn't work?

164
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,830
I'II leave it to you to make the preparations.

165
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,670
Whatever it takes. We need this man Lee in custody.

166
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,350
- I understand, Mr. President.  - Thank you, Jack.

167
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,900
- You have a Chinese interpreter?  - Melissa Raab. Very good.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,830
I need her, Curtis and one of his agents ready to move on the consulate now.

169
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,950
Edgar Stiles.

170
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,390
- We got a partial.  - I'm opening a window. Send it through.

171
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,460
Ms Dessler.

172
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,860
Division called. That video tape, they were able to reconstruct part of it.

173
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,390
They're sending it to my workstation as we speak.

174
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,470
Bill.

175
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,590
People of America, you wake up today to a different world.

176
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,310
One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you.

177
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,350
It'll be days and weeks before you can measure the damage we have caused,

178
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,810
but as you count your dead...

179
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,670
"Wake up today to a different world. "

180
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,260
Do we take that literally? He'll set off the warhead before dawn?

181
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,190
We have to look at the worst case scenario. What time is sunrise on the east coast?

182
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,670
7:02. Less than two hours from now.

183
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:46,910
Unless you renounce your policies of imperialism and interventionist activities,

184
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,370
this attack will be followed by another, and another after that.

185
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,770
The Chinese consul in Los Angeles. A man named Koo Yin.

186
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,560
Mr. Koo. This is David Palmer.

187
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,150
It's an honor to speak with you.

188
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,780
I'm calling on behalf of President Logan.

189
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,740
The situation today has forced him to direct his attention to other equally urgent matters.

190
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,110
I understand.

191
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,630
And my government extends its sympathy for these terrible attacks on your country.

192
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,910
We stand ready to help in any way we can.

193
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,190
Thank you. The fact is, you can help us.

194
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,890
There's a man in your consulate by the name of Lee Jong.

195
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,070
Yes.

196
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,030
He arrived here earlier tonight.

197
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,530
We have evidence connecting him to the terrorists behind today's attacks.

198
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,950
We need to take Mr. Lee into custody immediately for questioning.

199
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,370
Mr. Lee expected suspicion to fall on him.

200
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,560
He says he has no connection to terrorists.

201
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,710
We believe he's helping terrorists detonate a nuclear device on our soil.

202
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,770
Many lives are at stake, Mr. Koo.

203
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,070
President Palmer, I would very much like to help, but Mr. Lee is a Chinese citizen,

204
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,590
and the consulate is Chinese territory.

205
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,670
I can't hand him over to you without going through channels.

206
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,190
Then I urge you to contact the premier immediately and explain the situation.

207
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,710
Tell him speed is of the essence.

208
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,030
Tell him cooperation will be regarded

209
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,470
as an extraordinary act of friendship on the part of his nation.

210
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,750
And our nation will respond in kind.

211
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,080
Mr. President, I'll do my best. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

212
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,760
Yeah. Hold on.

213
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,430
Thank you, Mr. Koo.

214
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,230
Consul gonna try to make something happen.

215
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,150
How long will it take?

216
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,590
I don't know.

217
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,550
Anything new?

218
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,810
Yeah, White House authorized adding Iowa army reserve units to the ground search.

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,150
- Have they widened the perimeter?  - Yeah, they lied down a 60-mile radius around the area.

220
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,190
But Marwan's people might have sneaked it outside that.

221
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,210
We closed all major roads and air traffic, but there is a chance they got it through.

222
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,990
Homeland Security's faxing over casualty projections based on that.

223
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,270
- That's probably them right now.  - Yeah. I'll get it.

224
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,910
- CTU.  - I'm calling for Tony. Who's this?

225
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,510
This is Michelle Dessler, a colleague. Who's calling?

226
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,590
The woman he happens to be living with. Is he there?

227
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,990
- It's for you.  - Who is it?

228
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,790
The woman you're living with.

229
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,160
Jen.

230
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,150
I've been calling everyone, going crazy looking for you.

231
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,400
Then I thought maybe Jack took you back there.

232
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,180
Do you have any idea how worried I've been?

233
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,830
I'm sorry, I should have called, but I've been busy.

234
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,190
Oh, really busy with Michelle Dessler?

235
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,580
- I'm working, Jen.  - For CTU?

236
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,750
On a provisional basis, yeah.

237
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,910
I thought you hated that place.

238
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,300
Things have changed a little.

239
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,430
Yeah. I guess they have.

240
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,810
Jen, we can talk about this later. Right now I gotta go.

241
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,150
- Tony, what's your ex-wife doing there?  - Jen, I'm sorry, but I gotta go.

242
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,310
Michelle, um... I'm sorry you had to find out like that.

243
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,430
It's really none of my business.

244
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,750
Yeah, it is. I should have told you I was living with somebody.

245
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,860
- I don't want to talk about this right now.  - Yeah, well, I do. Listen to me.

246
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:48,750
When you left, everything fell apart. Jen happened to be there for me.

247
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,730
You don't have to excuse your relationship.

248
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,350
I'm not making excuses.

249
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,630
I'm just telling you how it is.

250
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,790
Do you love her?

251
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,230
No.

252
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,870
Ms Dessler, new protocols from DOD came in. Should I send them to your screen?

253
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,950
Send them to station 16.

254
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,510
Thank you, Edgar.

255
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,390
- You OK?  - I'm fine.

256
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,550
Is there anything I can do?

257
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,180
I said I'm fine. I'm trying not to think about what happened. I'm gonna process it later.

258
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,630
Sure, fine.

259
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,840
Edgar, I appreciate your concern, I really do.

260
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,190
It's just that when I shot that guy I thought I'd go all foetal position,

261
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,630
but the true is... I didn't feel anything... at all. 

262
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,630
I hope I'm not some kind of a psychopath.

263
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,350
- He was trying to kill you.  - But still...

264
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,120
Maybe it's a delayed reaction kind of thing. Maybe you'll freak out about it in a few days.

265
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,780
- This is Koo Yin.  - Please hold for President Palmer, sir.

266
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,910
I hope so.

267
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,220
- Anything you come up with...  - Sir.

268
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,790
Sir. Bill Buchanan.

269
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,990
- Thank you.  - All right.

270
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,770
- Yes, Bill.  - Mr. President.

271
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,540
We've seen a tape recorded by Habib Marwan.

272
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,810
On it he says we'll be "waking up to a different world".

273
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,990
We can't be sure with that means what may indicate that

274
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,990
the warhead will be detonated before dawn on the east coast.

275
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,070
Thank you, Bill.

276
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,350
CTU thinks that the warhead may be detonated before dawn.

277
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,130
Get me Mr. Koo.

278
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,470
We have the consul, sir.

279
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,630
- Mr. Koo.  - I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.

280
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,300
Is the premier aware of the situation?

281
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,710
- Yes, he's considering it very carefully.  - There's no time for that.

282
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,670
I've learned the terrorists may detonate a nuclear device within the next two hours.

283
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,270
Mr. Palmer, I understand the urgency of the situation.

284
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,510
Without making any promises, I have every expectation of a favorable answer.

285
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,270
- When?  - I'll speak with him in two to three hours.

286
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,850
- I told you, that's not soon enough.  - I'm sorry, Mr. President, it's the best I can do.

287
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,030
Thank you Mr. Koo for your efforts. Please keep me informed.

288
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,420
Of course, Mr. President.

289
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,270
He thinks Mr. Lee will be handed over to us, but not before two or three hours.

290
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,830
From their point of view, that's very fast for something like this.

291
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,110
From ours, not nearly fast enough.

292
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,110
What do we do?

293
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:17,190
Thank you, Mr. President.

294
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,550
- Bauer.  - Jack, are you at the consulate yet?

295
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,070
Yes, sir. We're across the street. Have they agreed to release Lee?

296
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,710
Not quickly enough.

297
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,550
And I just learned that the nuclear device may be set off at any moment.

298
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,590
Now, Jack. Is there any doubt in your mind that Lee is working with Marwan?

299
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,470
No, sir. The emails he sent left no room for doubt.

300
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,310
Then we have to get Lee now and find out what he knows.

301
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,110
Yes, sir.

302
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,790
No one connected with the government can admit to knowing anything about this. Ever.

303
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,550
If you're caught, you'll be tried in a Chinese court under Chinese law.

304
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,730
I understand.

305
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,270
Now, Jack, if it was anyone else, I'd ask if you were sure about this.

306
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,470
With you I already know the answer.

307
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,350
God bless you. Good luck.

308
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,110
We're on. We're going in to get him.

309
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,190
All right.

310
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,230
- Almeida.  - Tony, this is Jack.

311
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,190
I'm at the consulate. I need infrared satellite coverage.

312
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,610
I'm on it. What's going on, Jack?

313
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,310
The consul not gonna release Lee in time. We have to go in and get him.

314
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,990
- Who knows?  - We've authorization from the White House.

315
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,790
Tony, this is a covert operation. You're the only person in CTU who can know.

316
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,370
I need to spoof the satellite logs and make sure the mainframes aren't monitoring your station.

317
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,790
Tony, there can't be any record. You understand?

318
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
- Yeah.  - OK, thanks.

319
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
If I get caught, I have to be able to say I was acting alone.

320
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,670
Let's suit up.

321
00:21:49,380 --> 00:22:01,760
- All right. What do you want us to do?  - Cover the perimeter.

322
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,870
- Tony, it's Jack. I'm on comm.  - I'm uploading a picture of Lee to you right now.

323
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,880
Also, I just got a hold of the building schematic.

324
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,280
We'll continue monitoring in real time.

325
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,330
- You overlay the infrared?  - Coming now.

326
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,150
The bulk of them are in the first floor residential area.

327
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,940
- Most of 'em not moving. Probably asleep.  - Try the second floor offices.

328
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,570
All right. Grabbing data on the second floor.

329
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,870
- All right, we got people moving.  - That third room is probably where Lee is.

330
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,030
- I think you're right.  - I'll get back to you as soon as I'm moving.

331
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,990
- How do you want to deploy?  - I want Agent Raab to stay in the van.

332
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,570
You cover the perimeter. I go in alone.

333
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,870
- Jack.  - My orders are to make this deniable.

334
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,630
You can re-engage as soon as I leave the consulate.

335
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,570
But only on a covert basis. Masks on, non-lethal force. You understand?

336
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,630
We'll be here.

337
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,690
- Tony, I'm going in. Any change on infrared?  - Negative.

338
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,100
The alarm system's a Cambria model three.

339
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,710
I'm jumping the release of the door now.

340
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,730
Roger that.

341
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,430
All right, Jack, stop.

342
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,410
We have somebody approaching from your west side, I repeat, your west side.

343
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,480
OK, he's moving away.

344
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,610
Gimme the status on the other guards.

345
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,470
Jack, you're right on top of 'em.

346
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,330
We have someone approaching from your north side.

347
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,910
OK, you're clear.

348
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,750
- I got him.  - Roger that.

349
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,570
People moving towards you on both floors.

350
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,900
Exiting the consulate. Hostiles in pursuit. Bring up the van now.

351
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,990
Go, go, go, go!

352
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,790
Ow!

353
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,950
Let's go.

354
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,310
He's been hit. Pass me a medical bag. Now!

355
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,470
- We're in.  - Go, go!

356
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,110
- Jack, give me your status.  - We're away, Lee's in custody.

357
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,230
- He's shot in the back. No exit wound.  - How bad is it?

358
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,430
Can't tell. Doesn't look too severe. We're on our way.

359
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,340
- We're about 15 minutes out.  - All right, I'll have Medical ready.

360
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,420
- He doesn't want you to touch him.  - Tell him I need to check his wound.

361
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,790
Hold him down. Hold him down, now!

362
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,420
You need to calm him down so I can talk to him.

363
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,670
Medical assistance is waiting and this will ease the pain.

364
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,390
- Does he understand?  - Yes.

365
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,510
That's great. Thank you very much.

366
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,430
Hey. The FAA's cleared us to leave at eight o'clock on a medical transport plane.

367
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,690
- Dr Besson's agreed to accompany us.  - That's great news.

368
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,700
As soon as you settle in I'll start looking for an apartment.

369
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,270
I don't know what to say.

370
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,150
- I'm gonna get through this.  - I know you will.

371
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,030
Raines.

372
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,090
- I have your flight information.  - Yeah.

373
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,890
- A medevac will be there to pick you up at 0630.  - Ok.

374
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,570
- All right, you're gonna take care of the transportation.  - Yes, ma'am, that's correct...

375
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,870
I gotta call you back. Paul?

376
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,420
Paul, what is it? Paul?

377
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,840
Dr Besson! Please, someone come quickly!

378
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,990
Ok, Ok, Ok. It's Ok, he's right here.

379
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,270
Ten milligrams vasopressin.

380
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,750
He just started gasping, I don't know what's going on.

381
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,210
I can barely hear his heart.

382
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,460
We need to do altrosound(TBD), all signs point to a cardiac tamponade.

383
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,660
What does that mean?

384
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,830
The sac round his heart is filling with blood. We can drain it, we gotta get him to surgery.

385
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,030
If we don't stop the bleeding, his heart will not function.

386
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,170
- It's OK.  - Get the pericardial centesis tray now.

387
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,450
I need to roll him on his back.

388
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,430
There.

389
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,190
Tell him we know he helped Marwan with the warhead,

390
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,480
and we need him to help us find Marwan before he can detonate it.

391
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,650
If he denies it, tell him we can prove it with his emails.

392
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,230
He doesn't deny it. He knows where Marwan is, he'll tell you if you agree to terms.

393
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,430
What are they?

394
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,830
He said he was seeking protection from our government as well as Marwan.

395
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,790
Marwan wants to kill him to prevent him from talking. He wants our guarantee of protection.

396
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,750
Tell him if the information leads us to the warhead in time,

397
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,190
he will be immune from prosecution and I will take him wherever he wants to go.

398
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,990
He says it's acceptable, but he wants a guarantee of this in writing from the president.

399
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,710
Tell him I understand that and I give him my word. But I need the information now.

400
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,740
He says guarantee first before he will tell it.

401
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,330
No, that's not good enough. One minute. This is... This is Bauer.

402
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,150
- Jack, I have President Palmer.  - Put him through.

403
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,190
Jack, Buchanan told me you've got Lee Jong in custody, and that he was wounded.

404
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,870
- Yes, sir.  - Is he talking?

405
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,710
He wants to help us, but he won't tell us until he has a written guarantee he won't be prosecuted.

406
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:03,270
We also have to provide safe travel. His guarantee has to be signed by the president.

407
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,870
Jack, CTU believes the detonation of this warhead is imminent.

408
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,710
- Can you force him to talk immediately?  - I don't think so.

409
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,430
I think the fastest way to make this happen is to give him what he wants.

410
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,270
Ok.

411
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,270
I'll get the guarantee from Logan and have it waiting at CTU.

412
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,590
- What is it?  - Su Ming, the deputy Chinese consul.

413
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,830
- They didn't waste any time.  - They have to know we're behind the attacks.

414
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,950
What should I tell them?

415
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,310
I'll take the call.

416
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,930
We have to start fencing with them sooner or later. Might as well be now.

417
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,750
Mr. Lee won't talk unless he has a guarantee of immunity and safe transport.

418
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,500
Get that from Logan, will you?

419
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,750
- Mr. Su.  - Yes.

420
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,890
- Is this President Palmer?  - Yes.

421
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,710
Has the premier responded to the consul request to have Mr. Lee turned over?

422
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,770
Mr. President. The consul is dead.

423
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,670
- What?  - He was shot,

424
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,050
when armed men broke into this building and took Mr. Lee with them by force.

425
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
I am shocked and deeply saddened.

426
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,670
Please convey that to your government on behalf of mine.

427
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,560
Mr. President. Is it your position that you have no knowledge of this operation?

428
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,470
That the timing of your call and this abduction is entirely coincidental?

429
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,340
The consulate is sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China.

430
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,940
I can't believe anyone connected with this country had a hand in it.

431
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,270
I'm sure you understand the political ramifications if you are incorrect.

432
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,490
I'm sure you understand the ramifications of unproven accusations.

433
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,730
No accusations have been made, Mr. President.

434
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,410
But I can assure you there will be an investigation.

435
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,110
Your government will have my complete cooperation.

436
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,850
Thank you, Mr. President.

437
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,270
I'm sure you'll be hearing from us again.

438
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,980
Very soon.

439
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,870
President Logan will provide Lee with a written guarantee,

440
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,210
as long as it remains covert.

441
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,150
Sir?

442
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,230
What's wrong?

443
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,090
Koo Yin was killed in the course of the abduction.

444
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,990
My God! By one of our own people?

445
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,690
No. It must have been friendly fire, but it really doesn't matter.

446
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,510
If they're able to find proof that we were involved,

447
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,590
in the long run the repercussions will be as serious as those we face with the terrorists.

448
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,150
Tony.

449
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,130
I just heard that Lee Jong is on his way here and he's been shot. How did this happen?

450
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,590
The Chinese weren't gonna give Lee up in time, so Jack had to extract him.

451
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,150
Jack went into the consulate? On whose authority?

452
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,310
The White House.

453
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,200
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?

454
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,630
This operation needed to be off the books, to make sure it was deniable.

455
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,710
- But you knew about it.  - Yes, I did. I ran tactical from here.

456
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,820
It is absolutely unacceptable I was kept out of the loop on this.

457
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,350
- That's the way Jack wanted to play it.  - You don't work for Jack! You work for me.

458
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,100
A situation, frankly, I wish I'd been consulted on in the first place.

459
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,510
- Meaning?  - Meaning it was a mistake to reinstate you.

460
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,280
Now I'm certain of it.

461
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,430
Look, I understand you don't appreciate being kept in the dark,

462
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,330
but I think this is about something else.

463
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,570
Well, you're wrong about that too. And you were way out of line!

464
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,590
OK, thank you. Tell him we're almost there.

465
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,870
The medical assistance and the guarantee are waiting for him.

466
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,110
- I can't understand him.  - Ask him if he's in pain.

467
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,770
He says he's cold, very cold.

468
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,510
What's going on, Jack?

469
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,230
He must have severe internal bleeding.

470
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,330
- His lungs are full of fluid.  - I'll alert CTU.

471
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,220
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee. Tell me where Habib Marwan is.

472
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,350
Please, tell me where he is now.

473
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,370
Dammit, we're losing him.

474
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,110
All right, stand by with the gurney. We're coming in hot.

475
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,970
Jack.

476
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,210
Jack, what's going on?

477
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,360
- Jack?  - You can't come in here.

478
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,280
Jack, stop! He saved our lives.

479
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,550
- He's dying!  - So's he. Get out, I just started this operation.

480
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,200
This is our only connection to a stolen warhead. You gotta save him now.

481
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,390
- I'll get to him as soon as I can.  - He won't make it.

482
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,130
- I already have a patient!  - Curtis.

483
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,250
- You have a new one.  - Are you crazy?

484
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,250
Maybe you don't understand me.

485
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,390
This is the only man who can find the missing warhead and stop it being detonated.

486
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,930
If you don't save him, millions will die. Do you understand that?

487
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,430
Millions of people. Start working on him now!

488
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,430
- Jack, what are you doing?  - If I walk away from Mr. Raines now, he'll die.

489
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,510
- You don't know that for sure.  - Jack!

490
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,310
Do it.

491
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,270
Now!

492
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,830
- More volume.  - Yes, doctor.

493
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,310
Jack, please. Please don't do this.

494
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,790
His lungs are damaged. He's lost a lot of blood.

495
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,140
Stabilize him so I can talk to him. Can you do that?

496
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,190
- Maybe.  - Then do it.

497
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,190
- Beborah, I need you over here.  - What about Mr. Raines?

498
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,660
Chest compressions if his pressure drops.

499
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,910
- I got it.  - Put some gloves on.

500
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,710
Jack. Jack!

501
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,910
I have my orders. I'm doing my job.

502
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,710
- I'm sorry.  - Sorry? You're letting him die!

503
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,350
- Get her away from me now.  - Stop it, Jack!

504
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,460
He has a tension pneumo, we have to relieve the pressure immediately.

505
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:56,340
Let go of me! Jack, listen to me. Please, stop this.

506
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,950
Jack, please, please, I'm begging you, Jack, stop it!

507
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,820
OK, let go of me. Please!

508
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,390
Jack, Paul crashing. Starting CPR.

509
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,830
What can we do for him? What can we do for him?

510
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,460
He's in V-fib. Use the defibrillator.

511
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,750
- Charging.  - Come on, buddy.

512
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,250
Clear.

513
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,830
- Come on.  - Hit him again, Jack.

514
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,130
Charging.

515
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,300
Clear.

516
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,720
- He's still flatlining.  - Give him epinephrine.

517
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,030
- Where is it?  - It's on the tray, second syringe on the left.

518
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,470
- Got it.  - Inject it in the IV.

519
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,590
- It's in.  - Come on, please, Paul.

520
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,570
Jack.

521
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,830
Jack. He's dead.

522
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,140
- Jack...  - No.

523
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,100
- Jack!  - No!

524
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,830
He's gone.

525
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,530
Oh, my God.

526
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,830
You son of a bitch, Jack, you son of a bitch! You killed him! He saved your life.

527
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,110
- Get her out of here now.  - How could you? You killed him!

528
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,350
I hate you, Jack, you killed him! How could you do this?

529
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,710
You killed him, Jack. You killed him!

530
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,510
Paul... Let go of me!

531
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,950
Get off me! Take your hands off, let go of me...

532
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,110
Suture.

533
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,460
- Is he gonna make it?  - I'm doing the best I can.

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

﻿1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,760
People of America, You wake up today to a different world.

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,920
One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you.

3
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,160
You wake up today to a different world.

4
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,260
Do we take that literally?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,280
That he'll set off the warhead before dawn?

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,700
A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian secured a hard

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,410
drive belonging to one of Marwan's associates.

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,180
This hard drive may contain information that could lead us to the warhead.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,070
I will give you full authority to act as my proxy whenever you think it's necessary.

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,620
Mr. Koo, there's a man in your consulate by the name of Lee Jong.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,310
We need to take Mr. Lee into custody immediately for questioning.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,920
But Mr. Lee is a Chinese citizen.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,240
I can't just hand him over to you without going through channels.

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,430
Jack, is there any doubt in your mind that Lee is working with Marwan?

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,000
No, sir...

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,110
the e-mails he sent left no room for doubt.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,550
Then we have to get Lee out now and find out what he knows.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,540
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,860
No one connected with the government can admit to knowing anything about this...

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,870
ever!

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,620
Got him!

22
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,660
Hostiles in pursuit. Bring up the van.

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,580
Mr. President, the consul is dead.

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,440
He was shot when armed men broke into this

25
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,440
building and took Mr. Lee with them by force.

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,120
Mr. Lee, tell me where Habib Marwan is.

27
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,310
Damn it, we're losing him!

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,210
Paul, what is it?

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,070
I can drain off some of the fluid but we need to get him back into surgery now.

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,830
Jack...

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,340
Jack, what's going on?

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,800
This man is our only connection to a stolen nuclear warhead.

33
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,920
You've got to save him now.

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,010
I already have a patient!

35
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,880
You have a new one!

36
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,590
If you don't save him, Billions of people will die.

37
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,340
Jack...

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,290
I have my orders.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,190
I'm doing my job.

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,950
Paul's crashing.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,880
Jack, he's dead.

42
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,610
Jack, you son of a bitch, you killed him.

43
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,900
The following takes place between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:21,900
Gauze.

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,700
Gauze.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
Is he going to make it?

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're going to do the best we can.

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,180
I just need him coherent long enough to get the information

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,600
about Marwan and the missing warhead.

50
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,160
I know, Jack.

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
You already made me aware of that when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines's life.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,400
One milligram atropine!

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,860
What is it?

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,300
Jack, I don't have time right now.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,000
Jack, we need to leave.

56
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,900
Let them do this.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,600
Gauze.

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,900
I'll be right outside.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm so sorry.

61
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,800
How could you?

62
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,700
How could you kill him, Jack?

63
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,700
How could you do it?

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,100
No...

65
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,360
No...

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
No... I can't...

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,900
I can't...

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
be there right now.

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Please, Audrey...

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,900
just tell me what you want me to do.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,700
Leave.

72
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,600
I want you to leave, Jack.

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Jack, you need to call the White House right away.

74
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,500
Mike Novick needs to speak with you.

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
It's urgent.

76
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay, fine.

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Paul Raines just died.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
There was only one doctor and I had to make a choice between Lee's life and Paul's.

80
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,500
A-and I chose Lee.

81
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,800
You did the right thing, Jack.

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,200
You okay?

83
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,500
No, I'm not okay.

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,300
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,100
Just tell me when Lee's out of surgery.

86
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,700
I will.

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Mike Novick's office.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,100
This is Jack Bauer for Mike Novick.

89
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,400
Please hold.

90
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Hello, Jack.

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,100
Have you gotten anything useful out of Lee yet?

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,600
No, he's still in surgery.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,700
How's that coming along?

94
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
Not great, but he's hanging in there.

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,050
I don't have to tell you we took a huge risk getting this guy,

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,600
under the assumption that he can help us find the nuclear warhead.

97
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Trust me, Mike, I know.

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,500
We also have a new situation.

99
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,000
What is it?

100
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,200
When you broke into the Chinese consulate, Koo Yin, the consul, was shot.

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,660
That's not possible.

102
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,200
My men never fired their weapons.

103
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Then he was accidentally hit by one of his own people.

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,900
How badly was he hurt?

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
He died, Jack.

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,100
Oh, my god...

107
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,400
I want you to talk to the members of your team.

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,800
Make sure that each one of them has an alibi for where they were during the ambush.

109
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,900
Okay.

110
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,600
This is an extremely incendiary situation.

111
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,600
I'm about to talk to President Palmer now.

112
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,700
We're trying to avoid a serious confrontation with China.

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
We'll handle it from here.

114
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,200
Thanks, Mike.

115
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
How did this happen?

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,660
Mr. Buchanan, the network security module lit up.

117
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,400
Someone on the outside is trying to jam our satellite servers.

118
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,900
Could this just be a high network load?

119
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,300
No, it's definitely a denial of service attempt.

120
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,200
What do you want me to do?

121
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,600
Do any damage yet?

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,460
No, the Cisco system is self-defending.

123
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,000
All right, have one of your people use the security auditor tool.

124
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,400
Maybe it'll lead us to Marwan's network.

125
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,800
That was my point from the start.

126
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,400
Chloe.

127
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
We're in an active code.

128
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,200
We don't have time for your personality disorder.

129
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,100
Do you understand me?

130
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,800
Chloe?

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,700
Yes or no?

132
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,300
Yes, sir.

133
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,400
This is Yasir.

134
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,750
Is the warhead in place?

135
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,940
Yes, but we have a problem.

136
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,100
I can't jam their satellite.

137
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,000
You assured me that you could handle it.

138
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,000
CTU must have just installed new software.

139
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,500
This wasn't in place last week.

140
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,300
We're going to have to move our schedule forward by an hour.

141
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,300
There won't be as many casualties if people aren't at work.

142
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,300
If you can't jam the satellite signal, they'll find us.

143
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
We can't let that happen.

144
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I understand.

145
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,000
How long are we going to keep the President in the dark?

146
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,400
Eventually he's going to find out that you authorized a raid on the Chinese consulate.

147
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,500
We have to keep it from him as long as we can.

148
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,700
Were you able to find Jack?

149
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,400
Yes. He's back at CTU.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The man they grabbed at the consulate, Lee Jong, is still in surgery.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Was he able to tell us anything about the warhead?

152
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,600
No.

153
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,700
What did Jack have to say about the Chinese consul's death?

154
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
It wasn't our people who fired the shot.

155
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,400
The Chinese won't care.

156
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
He died as a result of our trespass.

157
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,700
We have to start constructing a scenario that

158
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,700
doesn't implicate the United States government.

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,600
They must know we did this.

160
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,000
We called the consulate about Lee Jong half an hour before the abduction.

161
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,300
The Chinese don't want a confrontation any more than we do.

162
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,500
If we can create a scenario of plausible deniability, they may play along.

163
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,800
How do we do that?

164
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,900
Call CTU.

165
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,670
Have them find out which anti-Chinese factions have attacked

166
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,400
their embassies or consulates in the last five years.

167
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,200
Most of these groups you're talking about are asian extremists.

168
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm sure Bauer's team was predominately americans.

169
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,400
Bauer's team was masked.

170
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,800
No one saw their faces.

171
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,900
They were all masked?

172
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,700
Yes.

173
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,200
Wait.

174
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
His mask was lifted.

175
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
Use the image processing filters.

176
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,700
OK

177
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Let me see.

178
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Send this image to Beijing and Shanghai.

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Have them cross-reference it with our intelligence databases.

180
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Find out who this man is.

181
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,300
I will.

182
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Curtis, come here.

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,300
Listen up.

184
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,300
The Chinese consul was shot and killed during Lee's extraction.

185
00:10:59,330 --> 00:10:59,790
How?

186
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,200
We never got a shot off.

187
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,390
I know, I know.

188
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,600
It must have been friendly fire.

189
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,200
But look, we've got to make sure all our alibis cross check.

190
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,120
No one outside of this operation is to know that

191
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,100
we were anywhere near the Chinese consulate tonight.

192
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,900
Understood?

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Jack, what's gonna happen?

194
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Are we going to be brought into this?

195
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,100
I don't know yet.

196
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,800
All I do know is now that the consul's been killed, everything has changed.

197
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,700
It's our responsibility to make sure that the United

198
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,300
States government is never implicated in this operation.

199
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,100
Don't worry, Jack.

200
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,100
Everyone here gets it.

201
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay.

202
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,700
Curtis, you advise the rest of the team.

203
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,200
You got it.

204
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,500
Yasir.

205
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,700
They're ready for you to make the changes.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
Do you think they'll find it before we launch?

207
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,900
Not if I move up the launch time.

208
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,100
They're looking for the warhead in their cities.

209
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,700
They have no idea that it's going to be delivered by missile.

210
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,280
Morrison?

211
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:55,700
Yes, sir.

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,300
Open up the guidance firmware.

213
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm going to upload a new instruction set.

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Yes, sir.

215
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,100
Okay, go ahead.

216
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,100
All right, you'll be ready to start the launch

217
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
sequence as soon as we've reprogrammed the onboard.

218
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,900
Good.

219
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,800
Jack, prep all your databases.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,700
When Lee comes to, we're gonna have to move quickly.

221
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,510
What about the warhead?

222
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,300
We're meeting on it now.

223
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,700
Chloe, I need you to free up a server for a large DOD Block transfer...

224
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,700
it'll be coming through a locked channel from Heller's office.

225
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Has that been authorized?

226
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
No, not yet, I still have to talk to Audrey.

227
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,200
That's gonna be weird.

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,600
What?

229
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,900
Talking to Audrey, I mean, you had to do what you did and her husband died.

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,900
It's probably destroyed your relationship with her.

231
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,500
Chloe, please, just free up the server.

232
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,700
Okay.

233
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,300
Jack, I just want you to know that if you need

234
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,500
anyone to talk to as a friend, I'm here for you.

235
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,000
Not now, but later, when things calm down.

236
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,700
Thanks.

237
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,100
Audrey, I'm sorry to bother you.

238
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,600
I need you to call Marcy, authorize a block transfer.

239
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,100
We need all pertinent D.O.D.

240
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,400
Databases sent over here to CTU.

241
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,200
Were you able to keep Lee alive?

242
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Yeah, he's stabilized.

243
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,100
All right.

244
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,700
I'll call Marcy.

245
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,300
Thank you.

246
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,900
Now the warhead was stolen here, in eastern Iowa.

247
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,300
We don't yet know how it's being transported

248
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,800
Are we monitoring air traffic?

249
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,700
Yes... so far nothing's been picked up.

250
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,500
Well, if they have to stay on the ground, how far could they have gone?

251
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,940
Based on our latest information, 300-mile

252
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,200
radius, which includes three metropolitan areas.

253
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,600
Have those cities been alerted?

254
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,500
The President wants to keep that information restricted for the time being.

255
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,300
We have raised local alert levels, but haven't mentioned specifics.

256
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,400
Marwan and his people have control of the nuclear warhead.

257
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,300
We have to figure out when and where he's going to set it off.

258
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,100
I want you looking at everything... from satellite to local police.

259
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,500
We have a small window.

260
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,500
It's still the middle of the night.

261
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,400
If Marwan leaves a trail,

262
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,310
it's going to be a hell of a lot easier to follow it

263
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,200
now than in two hours when people start going to work.

264
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Let's get to it.

265
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,500
See it again.

266
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,600
We think this is the man you asked us to find.

267
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
But you're not sure.

268
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,200
There was a good match on a lot of the available characteristics.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Howard Bern.

270
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,100
Member of a tactical unit for CTU Los Angeles

271
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,600
What are you going to do?

272
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,500
Talk to him.

273
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,300
How? CTU won't let you anywhere near him.

274
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,680
They'll have to. It would be a diplomatic mistake

275
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,200
for them not to cooperate under the circumstance .

276
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,300
Switchboard

277
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,000
Get me the head of CTU Los Angeles.

278
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,900
Wait,please.

279
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,300
There's a program at division you can filter those markers through.

280
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
It'll tell you which ones are good.

281
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,500
Yeah?

282
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,700
I've got a Mr. Cheng from the Chinese consulate who wants to speak to Michelle.

283
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,100
This is Michelle Dessler.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,600
Ms. Dessler, my name is Cheng Zhi, head of security for the Chinese consulate.

285
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm sure your office is aware of the incident that happened here earlier tonight.

286
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,600
Yes, we were very sorry to hear about it.

287
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,600
Is there anything we can do to help?

288
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
I would like to come over and discuss this matter with you.

289
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,700
Of course.

290
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,600
My office would be more than glad to make an appointment with you in the morning.

291
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,200
No, I need to do that right now.

292
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,100
I'm afraid that's impossible.

293
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,160
You must know we're in the middle of a national security crisis.

294
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,200
The murder of a Chinese consul on Chinese soil could be construed as an act of war.

295
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,500
What does that have to do with us?

296
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,700
I believe your agency stormed the consulate and kidnapped Lee Jong.

297
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
That is an outrageous accusation.

298
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,140
Just an hour earlier, your government called

299
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,700
and asked for permission to speak to Lee Jong.

300
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,900
30 minutes later we were attacked.

301
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,000
It is unlikely these two events are unrelated.

302
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm sorry, Mr. Cheng, I can't help you.

303
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,500
I suggest you cooperate voluntarily.

304
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,400
Otherwise, I'll be forced to go above you on this.

305
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,800
I'm sure you'll do what you have to.

306
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,300
I mean no disrespect, but I do have to get back to work.

307
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,300
Very well, Ms. Dessler.

308
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,100
You'll be hearing from me soon.

309
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,000
Hello?

310
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,200
Get me Secretary of State Taylor

311
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,800
Tell him it's an urgent matter.

312
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,700
Yes, sir.

313
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,000
Comm just confirmed that we got the data from Marcy, thank you.

314
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,500
You're welcome.

315
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Yeah.

316
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,300
Audrey, you should get some rest.

317
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,300
With everything that's going on, I can't.

318
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,700
You could go back to the hotel.

319
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,700
Jack, please don't tell me what to do.

320
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,600
What?

321
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,900
Jack, what do you want from me?

322
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,600
You made a choice that killed Paul, and I'm trying to deal with it.

323
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,900
We both have a job, let's just do it.

324
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,000
Jack.

325
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,900
Michelle says the head of security at the Chinese consulate just called.

326
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,000
What?

327
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,700
He made it sound like he has evidence linking CTU to the abduction of Lee.

328
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,680
What kind of evidence?

329
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,700
He didn't say, but he wants to come down here and talk to us.

330
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,600
They don't have any evidence, they're bluffing.

331
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
Bill, we don't have time to deal with them right now.

332
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,500
I agree, but we don't have much choice.

333
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I need you to help me figure out how to deal with this, Jack.

334
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,300
I need to check on Lee's condition first.

335
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll get back to you.

336
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,500
All right.

337
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,500
CTU just sent this over.

338
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,510
These five groups have all made attempts to attack or sabotage

339
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,200
Chinese targets around the globe in the last two years.

340
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,500
This group here...

341
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
people's freedom coalition?

342
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,400
They've actually made speeches where they referenced

343
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,000
Lee Jong's involvement with the Chinese nuclear program.

344
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,980
So an attack on the consulate and the grab

345
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,100
of Lee Jong by this group would be plausible.

346
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,100
It would allow the Chinese to save face.

347
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,020
And if the Chinese can't provide proof that we entered

348
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,000
the consulate, saving face may be all they need.

349
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,200
If you want, I can start leaking it to the media.

350
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,800
Do it.

351
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,500
Mr. President.

352
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
David, what have you done?

353
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,100
Excuse me, sir?

354
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,810
I just got a call from the secretary of state telling me about

355
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,200
a covert action against the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.

356
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,600
That's correct.

357
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,400
I sanctioned it.

358
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,500
Why would you have done such a thing?

359
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,260
It was the only option at the time.

360
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,700
Don't you know how fragile our relationship with China is right now?

361
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
You authorized an attack on their consulate!

362
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,660
That's a military engagement.

363
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,860
It was a covert operation,

364
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,620
not dissimilar to those carried out by

365
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,800
countries on a routine basis around the world.

366
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,660
Don't give me a social studies lesson, David.

367
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,000
We marched onto Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals

368
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,400
and in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

369
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
We were unlucky, sir.

370
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Unlucky?

371
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,160
Yeah, I would say that we were unlucky.

372
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
That's the kind of thing that could start a war...

373
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,660
now how am I supposed to be able to fight

374
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,600
terrorists while I'm provoking a nuclear superpower?

375
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
I would advise you to calm down, sir,

376
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,100
if we're going to get through this day.

377
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,800
We didn't bring this crisis on ourselves,

378
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,500
but we're going to be the ones to settle it.

379
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
This is a dirty business,

380
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,800
and we're gonna have to get our hands dirty to clean it up.

381
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,060
Now, please, Mr. President,

382
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,600
you brought me here to help you.

383
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,100
Let me do it.

384
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,700
Tony, what's the latest on Lee?

385
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,900
He's out of surgery.

386
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,200
Dr. Besson thinks he'll be able to respond to questions soon.

387
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,800
All right, when that happens, I want everyone from comm on standby.

388
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,670
Whatever information Lee gives us on the

389
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,600
warhead I want worked up without any time lags.

390
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,400
We're clear about this, correct?

391
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes, sir.

392
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,500
good

393
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,900
That was secretary of state Taylor.

394
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,200
He just authorized the head of security at the Chinese

395
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,400
consulate to come here and question us about the raid.

396
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,700
What?

397
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
In the middle of all this?

398
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,560
All right.

399
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
This breaks down very simply.

400
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
They want to prove that we attacked the consulate tonight.

401
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,000
We have to make sure they can't do that.

402
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, that ambush has got to land on someone.

403
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,800
Mike Novick's working on that from Washington.

404
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,900
We just have to make sure all our bases are covered here.

405
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,000
Finding that nuclear warhead is our number one priority.

406
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,600
I'm going to go over the strategy with Jack.

407
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,250
When Cheng gets here, send him to the Situation Room, 

408
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,800
make sure all our visible screens are masked.

409
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,600
Okay.

410
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,200
This situation with the consulate is dragging us down.

411
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,300
We shouldn't be diverting resources away from finding that warhead.

412
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,300
Hopefully this will just be a formality and we can get rid of him quickly.

413
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,490
If we don't get information from Lee,

414
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,700
Audrey's husband will have died for no reason.

415
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,200
What is she still doing here?

416
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,700
I think she wants to stay busy so she doesn't have to think about it.

417
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,400
It's funny, when I met Audrey this afternoon,

418
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,000
it seemed like she and Jack were totally together.

419
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,000
A few hours later, everything's changed.

420
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,800
Michelle...

421
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,800
I hate being without you.

422
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,700
I never wanted it to be this way.

423
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,100
Cheng's here.

424
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,900
Send him to the Situation Room.

425
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Buchanan and Jack are waiting there for him.

426
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,800
Shouldn't we keep him more isolated than that?

427
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,300
No.

428
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
We have to give the impression we have nothing to hide.

429
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,700
All right.

430
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,200
Mr. Cheng.

431
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,840
Yes.

432
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm Curtis Manning.

433
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,800
Hello, Mr. Manning.

434
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,100
Our regional director is waiting for us in the Situation Room.

435
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,900
If you'll follow me...

436
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,300
good.

437
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,900
Mr. Cheng.

438
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
Bill Buchanan.

439
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,700
Pleasure to meet you in person.

440
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,700
My condolences for the loss of your consul.

441
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,500
Thank you.

442
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,800
This is Jack Bauer from the department of defense, he's working for us today.

443
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,100
Mr. Cheng, please take a seat.

444
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,600
I know of Mr. Bauer, of course, from his previous service to this country.

445
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,100
We knew you were in Los Angeles today.

446
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
When did you arrive?

447
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,600
Flew in from Washington a couple of days ago with Secretary Heller.

448
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,900
I assume, then, secretary Heller is still here.

449
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,560
No.

450
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,200
For security reasons, he's at our district office.

451
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Why aren't you with him?

452
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,400
We felt, under the circumstances today, I could be more helpful here at CTU with Bill.

453
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,200
That's odd.

454
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,200
Not really.

455
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,200
As you know, I used to run this office.

456
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,900
So if there's anyone capable of leading a covert operation under short notice,

457
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,230
you would be the ideal candidate.

458
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,480
Mr. Cheng, this kind of unfounded...

459
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,700
That's all right, Bill, I've got it.

460
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,830
Mr. Cheng, I can assure you that neither CTU nor I had anything to

461
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,800
do with the terrible events that took place at your consulate tonight.

462
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,400
I assume you know this man... Howard Bern.

463
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,900
One of your field agents.

464
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,400
This was taken by one of our surveillance cameras tonight.

465
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,400
This photograph has been altered.

466
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Just to make it clearer.

467
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,700
Or to set up a scenario that you can utilize for political propaganda.

468
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,700
No, Mr. Bauer.

469
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,460
We ran this image through our database.

470
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,860
The computer picked Mr. Bern as a near perfect match.

471
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,120
Did you take the time to cross-reference your database

472
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,300
to include members of the people's freedom coalition?

473
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,120
Because according to our information, they're

474
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,600
the group most likely behind this attack.

475
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
That would be pointless, wouldn't it?

476
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,700
This man is not asian.

477
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,660
Mr. Cheng,

478
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,670
you and I both know that the PFC has initiated terrorist

479
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,700
activity around the globe utilizing european mercenaries,

480
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,500
half a dozen of which are a closer match to this photograph than agent Bern.

481
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,400
I take it, then, Mr. Bern is not available to question?

482
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,500
No, he's not here tonight.

483
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,800
Of course.

484
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,130
Mr. Cheng, you must know that it would not be in

485
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,700
America's best interest to provoke the Chinese government.

486
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,600
Then what are we playing these games for?

487
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,000
30 minutes before we were attacked, you asked our consul to give up Lee Jong.

488
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,380
Before our government can comply, the

489
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,900
consulate was attacked, Lee Jong disappeared.

490
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,800
Now you tell me you don't have Lee Jong.

491
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,400
Howard Bern is not available to be questioned.

492
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
What are you trying to hide?

493
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,400
We're not trying to hide anything, sir.

494
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,900
We're just extremely busy.

495
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,800
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

496
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,900
This is Bauer.

497
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,200
We are faced with unprecedented terrorist attacks on American soil.

498
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,600
All of our resources and attention are focused on trying to stop those attacks.

499
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,200
Thank you.

500
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
We have confirmation on Marwan's last location.

501
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,800
Follow up on that.

502
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,700
I'll handle the rest of Mr. Cheng's questions.

503
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,000
I'd like to see the hourlies for Mr. Bauer.

504
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,400
I'll see what I can do.

505
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,500
O'Brian.

506
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,600
Chloe, it's Jack.

507
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,500
Have Bern meet me in the east corridor.

508
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,300
Get a chopper ready now.

509
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,100
I will.

510
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,200
Meet Jack in the east corridor now.

511
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,400
Dispatch.

512
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,360
This is Chloe O'Brian

513
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Jack Bauer's requesting a helicopter standing by for immediate departure.

514
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,200
Okay, done.

515
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,900
Thank you.

516
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Come on, follow me.

517
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,200
What's going on?

518
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,800
A security camera at the Chinese consulate picked up your face.

519
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,850
That's impossible.

520
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,700
I was wearing my mask.

521
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Trust me, I saw the freeze frame.

522
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,500
It was you.

523
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,000
Jack, the guy ripped the mask from my face for one second.

524
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,860
I pulled it right back down.

525
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,600
I can't believe a camera picked that up.

526
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,600
I had no idea.

527
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
You're going to have to leave the city.

528
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,000
We're working out a scenario.

529
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,200
In a couple days, you're going to have to answer questions from the Chinese.

530
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,860
I didn't think anyone saw me.

531
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,400
That's why I didn't bring it up earlier.

532
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,900
Don't worry, we're gonna handle it.

533
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm sorry, Jack.

534
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,060
You got to go.

535
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,300
There's a chopper waiting for you.

536
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,280
This is Bauer..

537
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,500
Jack, Lee Jong's coming out of anesthesia.

538
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,000
He should be ready for questioning now.

539
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,100
Agent Rabb's already there.

540
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,700
I'm on my way.

541
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,560
Are you ready?

542
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,500
All my databases are active.

543
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,300
Okay, good.

544
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,100
Doctor, that's enough.

545
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:19,900
He's mine now.

546
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,600
Thank you.

547
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,800
Tell him he's in critical condition, he still needs medical attention

548
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,060
I'm going to ask him a few questions.

549
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,900
When he answers them, I'll let the doctor continue to treat him.

550
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,600
He understands.

551
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,800
Tell him I know that he worked with Marwan on the warhead.

552
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,300
Now he needs to tell us where it is.

553
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,000
He doesn't know.

554
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,450
But he knows where Marwan might be.

555
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,700
What do you mean, where he might be?

556
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
In the van he told me he knew where he was.

557
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,300
Because of what he's doing, Marwan's been moving around.

558
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:07,800
Where?

559
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,500
There are three locations he knows of that Marwan's using today.

560
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,200
What are they?

561
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,450
The Rocklyn building...

562
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,400
we know about that one.

563
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,160
A bar downtown.

564
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,300
We know about that one, too.

565
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,700
A factory on sixth.

566
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,300
Where on Sixth?

567
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,300
Alameda...

568
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,900
Sixth and Alameda.

569
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,460
Give me an exact address.

570
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
That's the one we're looking for.

571
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,600
I need you to assemble a team, make sure Curtis is on it.

572
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,800
They need to be ready to move now.

573
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,400
Yeah.

574
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,000
Audrey.

575
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,900
Yes?

576
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,300
The investigator from the Chinese consulate wants to talk to you.

577
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Why does he want to talk to me?

578
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,200
In order to protect Jack's cover,

579
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,100
we put together some new hourlies for him to look at...

580
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,700
They show you and Jack working together at the time of the ambush.

581
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,860
Buchanan wants me to lie to the Chinese to protect Jack?

582
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Not to protect Jack... to protect the United States government.

583
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Is that gonna be a problem?

584
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,500
Where are the hourlies?

585
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,200
Edgar's sending them to your system.

586
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,900
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this, Curtis.

587
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,600
I understand.

588
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,400
Well, whatever you decide,

589
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
you're still gonna have to talk to Cheng.

590
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,300
What's happening?

591
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,150
Lee gave us a probable location on Marwan.

592
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,700
We're getting ready to move on it now.

593
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,100
I'm being called in for questioning.

594
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,000
By who?

595
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,900
Cheng, from the Chinese consulate.

596
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,800
Come here.

597
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,060
Why you?

598
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,980
Buchanan modified the hourlies so that it'd look like

599
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,800
you were working here with me during the abduction.

600
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,600
I'm sorry, but whatever Buchanan laid out, you got to stick to it.

601
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,000
We need to sideline Cheng now.

602
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,000
Why?

603
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,920
Now that Lee Jong's incriminated himself, 

604
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,500
the Chinese government's not gonna try to protect him.

605
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,700
That's not what this is about.

606
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,500
The Chinese consul was killed during Lee's extraction.

607
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,300
The United States government cannot be held responsible for that.

608
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,300
Jack, what are you doing?

609
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,900
You have broken every major protocol set by CTU and the DOD.

610
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:59,600
For what?

611
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,400
Is any of this working?

612
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,500
You're still alive,

613
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,100
your father's still alive,

614
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,500
and we managed to stop all but one of the power plants from melting down.

615
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,780
Yeah, it's working.

616
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,800
We have to fight to keep it working.

617
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,400
Do what you have to, Audrey.

618
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,300
I'm sorry, I've got to go.

619
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,450
Thank you.

620
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,000
Hello.

621
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,800
Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack's approach to Marwan's location ready.

622
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,200
Good.

623
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,200
Upload it to the teams, send a copy to Tony's station.

624
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,300
He's running point on this end.

625
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,300
You got it.

626
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,300
I am surprised that after you were kidnapped that you stayed on to work here.

627
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
That must have been very difficult for you.

628
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,260
I wasn't physically hurt,

629
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,400
and I wanted to try and help find the people who had planned these attacks.

630
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,300
Very admirable.

631
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,830
Now, I looked through the hourlies for Mr. Bauer, 

632
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,100
your associate from the defense department.

633
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,460
I noticed from 1:00 A.M.

634
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,400
To 3:00 A.M, you and he were working on some data-processing tasks.

635
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,500
Yes, that's correct.

636
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,200
And what analyst did you give this information to?

637
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,200
Edgar Stiles.

638
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,800
Why does that matter?

639
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,400
They go through all this trouble to reenlist a man who used to run this place...

640
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,300
Jack Bauer...

641
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,700
and he's doing data-processing?

642
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Well, it's much more subtle than it sounds.

643
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,660
There are hundreds of lists that have to be cross-referenced,

644
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,000
and with Mr. Bauer's experience, we were able to narrow the search.

645
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,700
I am surprised.

646
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,000
Why is that?

647
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,820
Meaning no disrespect, the log shows that your husband, 

648
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,700
Paul Raines, was at the clinic during the same hours.

649
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,000
And unfortunately, he passed away.

650
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,700
What's your point?

651
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,800
I don't believe you were with Jack Bauer, mining data.

652
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,900
That you were waiting for your husband while he was in surgery,

653
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,000
and that you are lying to me now to cover for Mr. Bauer.

654
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
Mr. Cheng.

655
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,300
I'm not going to allow you to stand there and accuse my people of lying.

656
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:06,800
No.

657
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,250
And I'm not going to stand here to endure half-baked alibis.

658
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,500
You can believe whatever you want, but my answers stand.

659
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,500
Now, if we are done, I do have to get back to work.

660
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,900
If you'll excuse me.

661
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:26,860
Manning.

662
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,300
President Palmer for Jack Bauer.

663
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
It's the White House.

664
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,500
This is Bauer.

665
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,000
Jack, this is David Palmer.

666
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,300
Mr. President.

667
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,400
CTU tells me you got something from Lee.

668
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,800
We got a location on Habib Marwan.

669
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,400
We're en route with tactical teams now.

670
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,500
We're hopeful we can put an end to this soon.

671
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
I hope you're right, Jack.

672
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,700
This warhead can detonate any moment now.

673
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,700
We know, sir.

674
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,900
Jack...

675
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,700
tell me about the representative from the Chinese consulate, Cheng.

676
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,600
Is he still at CTU?

677
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,100
He was there when we left.

678
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,800
Are we okay there?

679
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,500
They have a surveillance photo of one of my team members.

680
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
We told them that we didn't think the photo was clear enough to be conclusive evidence.

681
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,400
That's gonna hold them off for a while.

682
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,000
I see.

683
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,800
Thank you, Jack.

684
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,400
Thank you, Mr. President.

685
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,200
And good luck.

686
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,200
Thank you, sir.

687
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,900
All right, Mike.

688
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm gonna need you to advise the President that Cheng has to leave CTU now.

689
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,400
President Logan was clear that he wanted Cheng to have access there.

690
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,100
And he has.

691
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,300
But now Cheng is slowing them down.

692
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,900
He's got to go.

693
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,200
CTU needs to be able to do their job without the added pressure of a cover-up.

694
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,700
You think you can get President Logan to sign off on that?

695
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,300
I'll see what I can do.

696
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,300
Yes.

697
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,560
No, not now, Keith.

698
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,500
I have too many things to deal with first.

699
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,400
Yes, you do that.

700
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,300
Thank you.

701
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,900
What is it, Mike?

702
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,800
Mr. President, the Chinese security officer, Cheng,

703
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,500
is still at CTU, and he seems to be slowing things down.

704
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,520
Well, he wouldn't be there at all if Palmer

705
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,300
hadn't authorized an attack on his consulate.

706
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,800
It's too late to change that now, sir.

707
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,500
Yes.

708
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,000
Yes, it is.

709
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,760
If we order Cheng to leave CTU now,

710
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,560
it'll look like we've got something to hide,

711
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,980
and we'll just be giving the Chinese all the

712
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,700
justification they need to escalate this crisis.

713
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,800
Mr. President, if we don't find that warhead before it's deployed,

714
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,400
ten million americans could face annihilation.

715
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,900
And we could be at war with a Billion Chinese.

716
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,700
My advice, sir, is to worry about the Americans now and the Chinese later.

717
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,400
Your advice or David Palmer's advice?

718
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,300
Both of ours.

719
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
When I agreed to let you bring Palmer in,

720
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,100
it wasn't so the two of you could form an alliance against me.

721
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,600
Sir, that's not what's happening.

722
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,000
No?

723
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,400
Why don't you tell me what's happening.

724
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,580
You and David Palmer are running this country while

725
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,500
I'm taking phone calls from mid-level staffers.

726
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,800
Would you like me to ask President Palmer to leave?

727
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,700
No.

728
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,500
Call CTU, tell Bill Buchanan to escort Mr. Cheng out of the building.

729
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Yes, Mr. President.

730
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,000
Curtis, put Michaels in play now.

731
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,600
Chloe, this is Jack.

732
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,600
We're at the perimeter outside the factory.

733
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,700
Our men are getting into position.

734
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,700
Can you confirm that Marwan's inside?

735
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,700
I can't say for sure, but I'm detecting a microwave uplink to the building.

736
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Can you intercept it?

737
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:49,860
No.

738
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
It's got encryption.

739
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,800
Okay, thanks.

740
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,500
Are we ready?

741
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,200
Yeah.

742
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,700
How are we gonna confirm Marwan's inside there?

743
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,400
We don't.

744
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,300
We're out of time.

745
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,400
We move now.

746
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,400
Give all teams a go.

747
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,100
All right.

748
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,600
All teams, it's a go.

749
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,700
So you know, Mr. Buchanan, this matter will be pursued.

750
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,500
I will return with a formal order for a more extensive investigation.

751
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,200
I understand.

752
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,200
In the meantime, if I were you, I'd focus my attention on the people's freedom coalition.

753
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,200
I'm quite sure they are your perpetrators.

754
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,100
We'll do everything we can to help you.

755
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,800
Sir.

756
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,100
Excuse me.

757
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,800
Jack's team is at the staging area outside the building.

758
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,600
I'll be right there.

759
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,800
Mr. Cheng, excuse me, please.

760
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,900
I have to get back.

761
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
My men will escort you from the building.

762
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:40,900
Thank you.

763
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,500
Edgar.

764
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,600
Excuse me.

765
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,500
Edgar Stiles, communication analyst, right?

766
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,400
Yeah. I'm busy.

767
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,400
I forgot to ask Mr. Buchanan one last thing.

768
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,500
Maybe you could help me.

769
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,350
I can't help you.

770
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,290
You should ask him.

771
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,200
It's not classified.

772
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,420
Audrey Raines had mentioned to me that you

773
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,800
were helping her earlier with some DOD files.

774
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,900
Yeah, until she was called down to the clinic.

775
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,400
So it was just you and Jack?

776
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,600
What?

777
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,700
Edgar, come here.

778
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,400
I have to go.

779
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,100
Bye.

780
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,500
Thank you.

781
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,600
You idiot.

782
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,880
What?

783
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Just keep your mouth shut.

784
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,900
I didn't say anything.

785
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,500
Hello?

786
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,000
The man who led the attack on our consulate was Jack Bauer.

787
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,500
Pull up all his files.

788
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,300
I want to look at them when I get back.

789
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,800
OKay.

790
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,300
Michael, are you in position?

791
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,300
Roger that.

792
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,400
He's at your two o'clock... take him out.

793
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,300
Copy that.

794
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,300
We're ready.

795
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,900
Start the sequence.

796
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
We're done here.

797
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,100
Get the car.

798
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,700
He's cornered in this room.

799
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
Counter-flank and push him back to me.

800
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,000
Copy that.

801
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,800
Freeze.

802
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,300
I've been waiting for this.

803
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,100
You're too late.

804
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,900
That hurts, doesn't it?

805
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,300
Jack.

806
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,400
Jack, what are you doing?

807
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,500
We still need him.

808
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,300
Go ahead,

809
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,800
kill me.

810
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,300
That won't stop the missile.

811
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
What are you talking about?

812
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,700
What are you talking about!

813
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,400
Jack, we got a problem.

814
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,300
Come here a second and look at this.

815
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Secure the prisoner.

816
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,600
Oh, my god, they've got a missile.

817
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
Have you got your comm unit?

818
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,600
Patch it through to the computer.

819
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,200
Tony, it's Jack. Can you hear me?

820
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:48,860
Yeah, Jack.

821
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,600
What's going on?

822
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,200
I'm looking at a live feed of the warhead.

823
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,500
It's been mounted on a missile.

824
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,300
A missile?

825
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,300
How can that be?

826
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,660
I don't know.

827
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,900
We're trying to get the feed over to you now.

828
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,500
Hold on.

829
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,700
Have you got it?

830
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,460
Yeah.

831
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,300
How much time have we got?

832
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,700
52 seconds.

833
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,800
Tony, can you see this?

834
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:11,800
Yeah.

835
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,600
Can you get a source of the transmission?

836
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,500
Hang on a second.

837
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,400
No, Jack... it's on an encrypted uplink.

838
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,460
There's no way to trace it.

839
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,900
Do a geography scan... see if you can pull a location.

840
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,500
Chloe, are there any identifying specifics on the visual?

841
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,300
Looks like a forest area, trees, a structure.

842
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,900
Tony, we're out of time.

843
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,600
We're trying, Jack, but we can't I.D.

844
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,700
The location... it's too general.

845
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,300
See if you can pick up a heat signature from the point of ignition.

846
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,800
We'll try it, but it's a wide radius.

847
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,400
There're not gonna be enough time to stop it launched.

848
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,100
Chloe, do you have anything.

849
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,100
I'm trying the four band satellite, but it's not working, either.

850
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


851
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,800
David, what have you done?

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,400
Excuse me, sir?

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
I just got a call from the Secretary of State telling me about a 

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,200
covert action against the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,400
That's correct. I sanctioned it.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
You authorized an attack on their consulate! That's a military engagement.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
It was a covert operation.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,800
We marched onto Chinese soil,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,200
we kidnapped one of their nationals, and in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,300
Mr. President,

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,700
if we don't find that warhead before it's deployed, 

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,500
ten million americans could face annihilation.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,100
And we could be at war with a billion Chinese.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,400
Is he gonna make it?

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,700
We're going to do the best we can.

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,100
I just need him live long enough to get the information about Marwan and the missing warhead.

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,100
I know, Jack. You already made me aware of that when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines's life.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm so sorry.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,650
You made a choice that killed Paul, and I'm trying to deal with it.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,860
We both have a job, let's just do it.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,300
I know that he worked with Marwan on the warhead. Now he needs to tell us where it is.

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,700
He doesn't konw. But he knows where Marwan might be.

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,100
A factory on sixth.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,950
They're looking for the warhead in their cities.

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,400
They have no idea that it's going to be delivered by missile.

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,830
Start the sequence.

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,560
We're done here.

28
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,400
They can't stop us now.

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
I've been waiting for this.

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,200
You're too late.

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Kill me.

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,000
That won't stop the missile.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,100
Tony, can you see this?

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,100
Yeah.

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,300
Can you get a source of the transmission?

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
No, Jack... it's on an encrypted uplink.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
There's no way to trace it.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Tony, it's Jack, have you got a lock on the missle?

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,000
No, we're still trying to find it, Jack, what're you gonna do with Marwan?

40
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,100
We're gonna scan the building one more time, then I'm gonna bring him in to the CTU, I want you to prep a holding room.

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Tony, I'm going out for comm, if you need me, get me on my cell.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,500
All right, you got it!

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
All you try to do is to decode his files.

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm gonna go prep the teams to look at the building.

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,200
Unbelievable,

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,200
how the hell did they manage to assemble a missle capable of carrying a nuclear warhead?

47
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,400
S-series cruise missle,

48
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,400
steath technology,

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,600
they must have smuggled it in piece by piece and then assembled it on site.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
If it's stealth, we can't track it by radar,

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,600
what about the targets?

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,900
Pull it up.

53
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,700
An S-series has a range of 1800 miles,

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,100
which means the warhead could be delieverd from the Midwest anywhere in the continent of United States.

55
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,600
Those missiles travel at a speed of 600mph,

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,300
which means it can hit the target on either coast in three hours

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,300
That's assuming it's heading for the coast,

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
If not, it could hit its target any time.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,000
There are no files on this,

60
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,800
He just used this to unscramble the downlink.

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,700
What else did you find?

62
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Nothing,almost clean.

63
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,600
Just the laptop and the cell phone.

64
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,100
OK. Take the SIM card off the phone and upload the SIM card to CTU. See if any of it's traceable.

65
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,600
Yeah

66
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,000
This is Bauer.

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,300
Jack,

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,500
this is President Logan.

69
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,400
I've just been told a cruise missile was launched containing a nuclear warhead.

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,300
Yes, sir. That's correct.

71
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,000
Our military tracking device is doing evething they can to find the trajectory of the missile,

72
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,400
but we don't have a lot to go on.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,500
What about Marwan, Jack?

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,300
You think that he will break?

75
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,600
That won't be easy, sir.

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,800
He's planned and organized everything that's happened today,

77
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,300
he's committed to his country, he's prepared to die.

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,300
I know that you'll do your best, keep me posted.

79
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes, sir. I will.

80
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Let the Joint Chiefs know the situation. But tell them this should be limited to the intelligence community only.

81
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,900
Sir,

82
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,500
if a nuclear missile was launched. We have to assume Washington is its target.

83
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
What are our options?

84
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,600
We don't have many.

85
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,000
The first of our priorities is to establish a continuity of government and start a quiet evacuation of government personnel in the city.

86
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,100
Bring the cabinet members and the Speaker of the House to the bunker.

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
Congress and Pentagon should be taken to the mountain safety facility.

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,800
All right.

89
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,100
Mike,

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,200
let them know that this is a category one emergency.

91
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,200
Tell them nothing more,

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
We can't afford an information leak.

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,200
David,

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,900
the public needs to be warned, cities need to be evacuated.

95
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,600
Not yet,

96
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,000
let's see what Bauer comes up at first.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
He will die before he talks to us.

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,300
I know.

99
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,400
OK. Stand down.

100
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,500
You and I both know that all I wanna do right now is kill you.

101
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,100
But I have my orders.

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,200
We've run out of time. You win. I've been instructed to ask you what you want.

103
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,200
What I want is already happening.

104
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,900
The death and destruction of the innocent life is means to the end. Why don't we just skip to the end.

105
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,400
To the end?

106
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,700
Everything that you did today,

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,400
you did for a reason. For your people. What do you want to change?

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,600
I have no interest in having a political discussion with you.

109
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,800
I am in the unique position to make things happen. I have the ears of the president of the U.S. right now.

110
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,500
You have the power to make any kind of the deal that you want.

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,300
And I promise you,

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,600
you will do more for you and your people if you cooperate with me than if you let that missle hit its target

113
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
You tell me where the missle is headed,

114
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,000
you help me to stop it,

115
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,800
then I guarantee you that you will talk to the president,

116
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,400
and he will listen to you, he has no choice.

117
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,900
Right here, right now,

118
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
you have the chance to get what you want.

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
I already have, Agent Bauer.

120
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,200
After this day,

121
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,900
every elected official

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,500
and citizen of the America

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,100
will know that America cannot intervene in our lives,nor our countries,

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,700
with impunity.

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,500
Besides,your president sees me in only one dimension.

126
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,800
Evil.

127
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,600
That's you see us?

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Yes,

129
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
and vulnerable.

130
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,700
Chloe,

131
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,100
come here.

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,900
What?

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,400
You're never gonna believe what I just found,

134
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,100
I got names off the calls received on Marwan's cell phone.

135
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,900
Take a good look.

136
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,200
Richard Heler

137
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,400
Right. Secretary of Defense Heller's son.

138
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,100
Called Marwan a week ago.

139
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,900
Did you tell anyone yet?

140
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,500
No.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Just you.

142
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,700
I'll let Buchanan know.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,700
With every minute that passes, the missile's target zone widens.

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,100
We need to get updates from regional teams.

145
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm sorry to interrupt, but you need to hear this.

146
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,400
Edgar just pulled a name off Marwan's cell phone.

147
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,100
It was from a call he received last week.

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,800
Who called him?

149
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,700
Richard Heller.

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,600
Are you sure?

151
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,200
We ran the number and it came up as originating from Richard Heller's cell phone.

153
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,100
That must be how Marwan knew where secretary Heller was going to be yesterday morning.

154
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,900
You think Richard helped to plan his own dad's kidnapping?

155
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,500
I don't know.

156
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
Where is he now?

157
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Well, it's 4:00 A.M.

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
He's at home asLeep, I guess.

159
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,300
Where does he live, Chloe?

160
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,300
Van Nuys.

161
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
We have field teams in the area?

162
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't know.

163
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
I'll pull it up on the IP phone.

164
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,300
Yes, we do.

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Dispatch them.

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,300
I'll call secretary Heller, tell him his son's being brought back in.

167
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,600
Chloe, does Audrey know about this?

168
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,200
No.

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
It's more of a management conversation, don't you think?

170
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
This is O'Brian.

171
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,900
Your team has been issued new orders.

172
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,800
You are to dispatch immediately to Van Nuys.

173
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Audrey, you got a minute?

174
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,800
Yeah, sure.

175
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,100
What is it?

176
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,600
It's about your brother, Richard.

177
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,600
Is he all right?

178
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,400
I assume he is, yeah.

179
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,400
What do you mean?

180
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,500
We just found out that Habib Marwan got a call from Richard's cell phone a week ago.

181
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
I'm sorry, but that's absurd.

182
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,000
We don't know what it means yet,

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,600
but Buchanan is sending a team over to pick Richard up right now.

184
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,600
Tony, my brother was already brought in once today and he was cleared.

185
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah, I know.

186
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
But this call definitely connects him to Marwan and the missile.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,100
Look, I don't know how he got mixed up in this, but my brother is not a terrorist.

188
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,400
Audrey,

189
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Richard's phone number was found in the received registry of Marwan's SIM card.

190
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
Does my father know about this?

191
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,500
Buchanan's calling him right now.

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,000
All right.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,900
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,000
All right.

195
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,800
I'll tell him, yeah.

196
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
Jack, we got something.

197
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,300
What?

198
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,200
Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.

199
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,900
We're sure about this?

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,700
Yeah, they're bringing him to CTU.

201
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,100
I want to question this kid myself.

202
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
We need to get back there now.

203
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Put the suspect in the vehicle.

204
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,900
We're headed back to CTU now.

205
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,900
It doesn't matter where you take me.

206
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,900
Yeah, we'll see about that.

207
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,300
This is Bauer.

208
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,900
Jack, were you able to get anything out of Marwan?

209
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,800
No, we're going to bring him back to CTU.

210
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,100
We think we got a better chance of breaking him there.

211
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,200
We're about ten minutes out.

212
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,400
Curtis, you okay?

213
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,500
Yeah!

214
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Can you see the shooters?

215
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
They're on the roof behind us.

216
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,600
Go!

217
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Notify the perimeter we no longer have Marwan in custody!

218
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,600
Perimeter teams, Marwan's escaped!

219
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
He's headed towards the southwest sector.

220
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
Chloe, what have you got on Marwan?

221
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,000
Nothing...

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,800
he already ditched the transport vehicle and we can't find him on satellite.

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,600
How did his people get into that area?

224
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,200
They didn't... they must have been there before us.

225
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
Marwan secured the location.

226
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,300
All right,

227
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,100
have perimeter teams comb the nearby buildings for remaining hostiles,

228
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,000
then shift personnel to tracking the missile.

229
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
We lost him, Jack.

230
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Damn it, Tony, how?

231
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,300
They dumped their vehicle on the freeway.

232
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,900
In the chaos, Marwan must have gotten into another car and driven off.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
We're trying to analyze the satellite right now,

234
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,900
but the images are too noisy.

235
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,000
How does Buchanan want to handle this?

236
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm here, Jack.

237
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,300
Finding Marwan is becoming less likely.

238
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,500
With that missile in the air,

239
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
we have to follow primary leads only.

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
Right now that's Richard Heller.

241
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Has he arrived yet?

242
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,700
No, our team's on the way to get him.

243
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,900
He'll be back here momentarily.

244
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,400
Bill, I want to interrogate this kid myself.

245
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,200
I understand.

246
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I'll have him ready for you.

247
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,700
Okay, we're on our way in.

248
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Curtis, we need to back to CTU.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,700
They lost Marwan.

250
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,100
We're going to have to track him from there.

251
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,200
What did Buchanan say?

252
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Richard Heller's in first position.

253
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,300
We're going to interrogate him.

254
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,400
Mr. President.

255
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,700
Please, everybody, be seated.

256
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,900
I would like to apologize for the abruptness of your removal from your homes and your offices.

257
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,200
Please know that every precaution had to be taken to ensure the secrecy of your arrival.

258
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,400
The U.S. has been thrown into a category one emergency.

259
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,000
A cruise missile containing a nuclear warhead has been launched and is now headed for,

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
we believe, a major U.S. city.

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,500
Very possibly washington D.C.

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,700
Now,

263
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,700
all branches of the military have been alerted 

264
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,500
and they're doing everything in their power to locate the missile and to intercept it.

265
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,600
Excuse me, sir.

266
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,500
You're saying that not only do we not know what the missile's target is,

267
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,300
but you don't even know

268
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,500
where the missile is?

269
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,200
That's correct.

270
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,600
When do you plan to inform the public?

271
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,300
As of this time,

272
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,100
we feel that informing the public wouldn't be in the country's best interest.

273
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,800
"We" meaning who, Mr. President?

274
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,100
I feel that way, Mr. Speaker.

275
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Doesn't the public have a right to know the truth?

276
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
That's all I have for now.

277
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
When I know more, an update will be given.

278
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,700
Thank you.

279
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,300
Mr. President.

280
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes, Don.

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,500
Sir,

282
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,800
I do not wish to question your decision in front of the cabinet,

283
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,400
but I think that you're making a grave mistake in not alerting the public.

284
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,000
Look, I've thought a lot about this and...

285
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,700
I'm certain it's the right course.

286
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, if I may say so, sir, you do not seem certain.

287
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,500
It's a difficult day for all of us, Don.

288
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,900
Now, if you'll excuse me.

289
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,800
Mike,

290
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,500
what's going on here?

291
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,700
Meaning what?

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Logan was sworn in a few hours ago,

293
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,400
we're under a massive terrorist attack... he needs all the help he can get.

294
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,000
He understands that and he's seeking advice from everywhere.

295
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,400
Not from his cabinet.

296
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,300
Or the congressional leadership.

297
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,700
Give it time, Don.

298
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,400
Give it time.

299
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Tactical's at Richard's house,

300
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
they're going through his things right now.

301
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,200
What about Jack?

302
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,200
Jack and Curtis are on their way back.

303
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,500
Someone has to tell Audrey that Jack's going to be interrogating her brother.

304
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,900
Audrey's not going to want to let Jack near her brother.

305
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,400
It can't be helped.

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
If Richard knows something about that missile...

307
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,400
It's funny, this morning Jack and Audrey were planning their future.

308
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,200
Now he's responsible for her husband's death,

309
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
and he may have to torture her brother.

310
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,100
And yet...

311
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,300
every move he's made has been the right one.

312
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,600
Not if he wanted to be with her.

313
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
Look, Michelle...

314
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,400
everything that's happened here today,

315
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
it's been hard going through it with you again.

316
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,200
It's been hard for me, too.

317
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,200
And I...

318
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,300
look at what this job does the people in our positions,

319
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,700
and I realize...

320
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,600
I want us to be together again,

321
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,400
but it's gonna be away from all this.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
You want us to leave our jobs?

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We've spent the last 12 years of our lives doing this.

324
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Where would we go?

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,700
What would we do?

326
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,700
I don't care.

327
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,800
People start over every day, if it's important to them.

328
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,300
You're asking me to leave the only thing I've ever done.

329
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Yes...

330
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,700
I am.

331
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,600
This is beyond belief!

332
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,900
I cannot be brought here!

333
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,900
Audrey, you got to get me out of here.

334
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
These guys broke into my house.

335
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,000
This is so illegal.

336
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,300
All right, Richard, listen.

337
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,200
Just calm down, okay?

338
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Listen to me.

339
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,700
Your phone number came up on the cell phone of a terrorist, all right?

340
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,700
That's what they said.

341
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,600
That's insane.

342
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,200
You know that.

343
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,800
Audrey.

344
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
Now listen, OK, just right...

345
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,300
Audrey.

346
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,800
Yes.

347
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
They have to get him into holding now.

348
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,300
Audrey!

349
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,300
Audrey, don't let them do this!

350
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't let them do this to me!

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Who's interrogating him?

352
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,400
Jack.

353
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,400
What?

354
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,700
You are not going to do this.

355
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,000
You are not going to torture my brother.

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
I'll be right in there.

357
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't want to hurt Richard, but we're out of time...

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,900
he knows something, and I'm going to find out what it is.

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,100
And what if he doesn't?

360
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,600
You're aware that he called Marwan.

361
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,800
It came up on his cell phone.

362
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
There has got to be an explanation for that.

363
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,300
Let me talk to him.

364
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,700
You honestly believe that you can interrogate your own brother?

365
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,800
It's because he's my brother,

366
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,100
maybe I can get something out of him that you can't, Jack.

367
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,800
Please, just give me five minutes.

368
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,800
Please.

369
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Take five minutes.

370
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,300
Thank you.

371
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,600
Mike.

372
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,400
Don.

373
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,500
How's, uh, President Logan managing?

374
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,900
Given the circumstances, he's doing very well.

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,100
I noticed that ex-President Palmer is here with him.

376
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,300
Yes, he brought the former President in to advise.

377
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,800
Yeah, well, that's probably a good idea.

378
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,300
Palmer's been at the helm in this kind of crisis before.

379
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,400
He knows how to lead.

380
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,000
President Logan doesn't have any problem leading,

381
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,100
if that's what you're getting at.

382
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,100
Oh, no, not at all.

383
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,700
It's just that if he's not going to ask his cabinet for help,

384
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,300
the leadership, it comforts me, somewhat, that he's in good hands.

385
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,900
Is there something else you wanted to say, Don?

386
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, yeah, there is.

387
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,800
The people elected john Keeler to run this country.

388
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,100
In his absence, Logan is expected to take over.

389
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
But if he's not up to the task,

390
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Mike, it is I, speaker of the house, and not David Palmer, who steps up.

391
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,500
Understood.

392
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,800
And let me assure you, that's not the case.

393
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,800
Logan is in complete control.

394
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,600
Excuse me, Don, I got to get back.

395
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,000
Sure.

396
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,500
Excuse me, Mr. President.

397
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,600
We may have a problem.

398
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,200
What is it?

399
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Don Ashton.

400
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,900
He's been asking a number of questions and raising concerns as to President Palmer's role here.

401
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
That's too bad.

402
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,200
We have more important things to worry about at the moment.

403
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,900
Sir, as the speaker of the house,

404
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,300
he can create problems which you don't need right now.

405
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,600
Mike's right, sir.

406
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,700
Don's very ambitious.

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,200
Now that he's next in line to the presidency,

408
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,300
he'll look to exploit any angle he can.

409
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
He won't put his ambition in front of national security.

410
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,800
No, he won't see it in those terms, sir.

411
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,000
In his eyes, national security and his personal ambition are one and the same.

412
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,600
What do we do?

413
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,700
Show him who's in charge.

414
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,900
Everything set up?

415
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,900
Yeah, he's ready.

416
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's do this.

417
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,200
Audrey!

418
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,100
Get me out of here.

419
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,600
Please, tell them I didn't do anything.

420
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Richard, I want you to listen to me very carefully, okay?

421
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,100
A missile carrying a nuclear warhead was launched by this man: Habib Marwan.

422
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,900
Tell me what you know about him.

423
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,100
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.

424
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,600
CTU has proof that you called him last week, lastTuesday at 4:00 A.M.

425
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know any Habib Marwan or anything about a missile.

426
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
You have got to believe me, Audrey.

427
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,700
Richard, that missile is in the air right now, heading toward a city.

428
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,600
Please, Richard, just tell me what you know.

429
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,700
I told you, I don't know anything.

430
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,400
Why'd you make that phone call last week?

431
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,800
I didn't make a phone call, Audrey.

432
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,900
What's happened with my son so far?

433
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,200
We decided to let Audrey talk to him first.

434
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
They just got started.

435
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,900
Has he confessed to anything yet?

436
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,600
No, sir.

437
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,900
Richard, it's not making sense.

438
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,400
That call was made.

439
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,300
Look, I don't know where you get your information,

440
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,700
Audrey, but it's all bull.

441
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,300
His readings are spiking.

442
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,700
He's holding something back.

443
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,400
Richard...

444
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,600
Richard, I am begging you to talk to me, all right?

445
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,100
If you don't,

446
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,700
there is a man who will come in here and he will get the information from you.

447
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,700
I saw him torture someone today.

448
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,200
It's what he's trained to do.

449
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
He won't stop hurting you until you tell him the truth.

450
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,900
Please.

451
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,400
Don't let them do this to me.

452
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,900
Tell me what you know and they won't.

453
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,600
I don't know what you want from me.

454
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,400
I don't.

455
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,000
Richard, look at me, look at me.

456
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,800
We have a chance to fix this.

457
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
- Audrey...  - This is not working.

458
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
We don't have time to coddle him.

459
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,500
Open up.

460
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,300
I don't care if he is my son, he's playing games now.

461
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,300
All right, Richard, this has gone far enough.

462
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:57,100
Either you tell us what we want to know or I will let them use every piece of equipment they have to drag it out of you.

463
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,500
You understand that?

464
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,300
Dad, don't...

465
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Audrey, leave the room.

466
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,300
Dad, please...

467
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,700
now!

468
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,500
I mean it.

469
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,100
Richard, I want you to tell them everything you know, please.

470
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
They can't do this.

471
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,600
Now what's it going to be, Richard?

472
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,500
Go to hell.

473
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,800
I didn't do anything wrong, I don't have to tell you anything.

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,600
There's a nuclear warhead going to detonate somewhere over this country.

475
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,200
Those lost lives will be on your head.

476
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,900
You will be a murderer.

477
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,800
I didn't mean to do anything wrong.

478
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,200
I swear.

479
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
What did you do, Richard?

480
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,100
Tell me what you did.

481
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,600
A week ago, I was...

482
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,600
I was at a bar and...

483
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,400
there was this girl and her boyfriend...

484
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,800
Okay?

485
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,100
Right.

486
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What were their names?

487
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,300
I don't know.

488
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,600
They wanted to party and I...

489
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,300
we...

490
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,800
we went back to my place.

491
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,600
We got high...

492
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,800
then...

493
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,200
I guess there was time for one of them to make a call on my phone.

494
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,200
How?

495
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
When we were in bed.

496
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,000
So while you were in bed with her,

497
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,200
he used your phone in the other room.

498
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
He wasn't the one in the other room, dad.

499
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,000
I was with him.

500
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,000
She must have been the one that made the call.

501
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
So, you were set up?

502
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,400
Yeah.

503
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,900
I guess so, dad.

504
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,900
Did they leave you with a number or an address?

505
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,200
No.

506
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,200
What kind of a car were they driving?

507
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,900
They didn't have one.

508
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,800
I drove.

509
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
Where did you drop them off afterwards?

510
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,700
I didn't.

511
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,200
They took a cab.

512
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Do you remember the name of the cab company?

513
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,100
No, dad, I don't.

514
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Get in touch with every cab company that works in the area.

515
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,300
I want their log books.

516
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,600
Get me a sketch artist now.

517
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,700
I'll run it.

518
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,100
- Take over.  - Yeah, sir.

519
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,000
So now you know.

520
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,500
I suppose you're even more disgusted with me, huh, dad?

521
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,100
This is not about how you choose to live your life, son.

522
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
This is about how you've put this country in jeopardy.

523
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
If you had told us this information yesterday,

524
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,200
maybe these terrorist attacks would not have occurred.

525
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
No, don't you put that on me, dad.

526
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,600
'Cause yesterday I didn't know that that night had anything to do with these attacks.

527
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,800
You should have told us everything.

528
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,100
I'll wait outside.

529
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,600
You made a profound mistake today, Richard.

530
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,400
Based on this information here,

531
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,300
- we can start to develop a contingency plan.  - All right.

532
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
You got the cab company?

533
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,300
Better than that.

534
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
We got the cab driver.

535
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,700
He dropped the couple off at an apartment complex in panorama city called the mercerwood.

536
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,900
Did you talk to the apartment manager?

537
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,700
Yes, we gave him a description of the guy and the girl.

538
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,000
He says he knows what unit they're in.

539
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,200
Okay, Jack, you take this.

540
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm gonna need our best field ops.

541
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
I want Curtis and castle.

542
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,900
I'm going to need Curtis here with me.

543
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,800
Then you got to give me Tony.

544
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,000
All right.

545
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,700
What about the phone call to Marwan?

546
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,800
I used our digital comm software to analyze Richard's phone.

547
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,800
The phone call to Marwan activated a listen-in.

548
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,800
He was able to hear all of Richard's calls after that night.

549
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That's why Marwan knew that secretary Heller was visiting Richard off book yesterday.

550
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,100
Anything on the missile?

551
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,400
We've been running military protocols, but so far nothing.

552
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,700
Do we know if President Logan is going to make an announcement?

553
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,100
As of now, the President still thinks that would do more harm than good.

554
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,100
Please, as you were, everybody.

555
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,000
Be seated.

556
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,500
Gentlemen and ladies,

557
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
considering the crisis that we face today,

558
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,100
I felt it prudent to enlist the assistance of ex-President Palmer.

559
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,300
In what capacity, sir?

560
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,100
Excuse me.

561
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,100
Sir, everybody in this room has a title and specific function.

562
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,800
Exactly what position will President Palmer be occupying?

563
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,700
I'm here solely as an advisor.

564
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,200
Not only to the President, but to anyone here who requests my counsel.

565
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,100
President Palmer's outside the chain of command,

566
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,900
if that's what you're asking me, Don.

567
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,200
Asking for a clarification, sir.

568
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,800
The missile carrying the nuclear warhead was launched from a location in central Iowa.

569
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,300
It's becoming more and more likely that the target is on or near one of the coasts.

570
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,700
It's clearly going to be New York or D.C.

571
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,700
Why aren't we evacuating those two cities?

572
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,000
I disagree, Jenny.

573
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,200
It's not clear.

574
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,800
And if you start to evacuate these two cities,

575
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,400
then you may have an unauthorized mass exoduses of Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlanta...

576
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,700
that's a situation I don't think the President should be dealing with.

577
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,700
Maybe the President should be telling us that himself.

578
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,700
Please, Mr. Speaker,

579
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,400
I've discussed this option with a number of domestic experts including President Palmer,

580
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,800
and that's my assessment as well.

581
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,900
What about air defense?

582
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,100
We going to stand by and let the airspace over these cities remain undefended?

583
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,800
We have a limited number of f-18 interceptor jets at our disposal.

584
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,300
They need to be augmenting the search for this missile,

585
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,000
and not deployed in a wait-and-see mode.

586
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,000
Mr. Palmer, I'm sure that we all appreciate your desire to help,

587
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,600
but the constitution has determined who the decision makers should be at this time.

588
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,200
I think you're overstepping your bounds.

589
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,600
In the first place, it's Mr. President, Don.

590
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,100
And it is the content of my statements you should be addressing.

591
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,700
David.

592
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,500
It's true, you are to be addressed as President.

593
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,300
It's an expression of respect,

594
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,700
but not a functional title.

595
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,300
I understand that, sir.

596
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,300
But you have to understand, I've been through this crisis before.

597
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,900
Yes, but we are here now.

598
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,900
The appointed and the lawful representatives of the people of the United States.

599
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,800
Mr. President...

600
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,000
David, there will be no more discussion on this matter.

601
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,400
Your point has been taken.

602
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,700
However, Ashton has made a good point, and I want to address his concerns.

603
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,300
Perhaps it's best if I excused myself.

604
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,200
Perhaps.

605
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,500
Ladies, gentlemen...

606
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,000
Mr. Speaker, I think you're right.

607
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,000
We're gonna put those jets over D.C.

608
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,600
And New York.

609
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,400
Did you see it on the inside feed?

610
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,100
Yes.

611
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,700
It went exactly as you'd hoped.

612
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,300
We won't have any more problems with Don Ashton today.

613
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,400
I hope you're right.

614
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,600
We'll be monitoring everything on three.

615
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,000
All right.

616
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,000
Make sure LAPD's there when we land.

617
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,600
We're going to need transport to the site.

618
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,000
They've already been called.

619
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,600
OK

620
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,200
Tony, wait.

621
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,700
I... I can't...

622
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,600
I can't spend another day without you.

623
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,600
I'm ready...

624
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,700
to leave here.

625
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,900
I'm ready to go with you.

626
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,900
Tony.

627
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,500
Be careful.

628
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,800
Right.

629
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,100
They're setting up a remote feed.

630
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,800
Richard's going to help Jack identify the suspects when they get onsite.

631
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,400
Then what?

632
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,100
Then they'll let him go.

633
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,400
His motives certainly weren't seditious.

634
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Dad, I feel so lost.

635
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,100
I know, sweetheart.

636
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,000
Ms. Raines?

637
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,600
Yes.

638
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,200
Jack Bauer's on line two for you.

639
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,800
Thank you.

640
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,900
You take it, sweetheart. I'll be on the floor.

641
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,200
Hello.

642
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Audrey, it's Jack.

643
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,500
I know you don't want to talk to me right now,

644
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,800
but there are a few things I need to say.

645
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,700
All right.

646
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,100
Look, I know with everything that's happened today,

647
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,400
you've seen me do things that...

648
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,500
before now, you thought were unimaginable.

649
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,800
I would have been happy to skip today.

650
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,400
Yeah, me, too.

651
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,900
But the truth of it is, Audrey,

652
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,800
I never believed you could ever really love me if you'd known about everything I've done.

653
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,700
Jack, I... I can't...

654
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,100
Audrey, please, let me finish.

655
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,200
These were the things that I was running away from.

656
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,400
That's why I moved to D.C.

657
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,900
That's why I stopped doing field work.

658
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,300
That's why I don't work at CTU.

659
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:22,100
All I know is that you're back in it, and it's too much for me, Jack.

660
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,900
I know.

661
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,900
I know...

662
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,800
the last thing I ever wanted to do was push you away from me.

663
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,100
God, Audrey, I love you,

664
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,600
but this is how the job has to be done.

665
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,000
I just want you to know how sorry I am that it had to involve you and the people you care about.

666
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,400
Look, you don't have to say anything now.

667
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Please, just promise me, as soon as this is over...

668
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,400
we can talk about everything that's happened.

669
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Audrey, please.

670
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,600
Jack.

671
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,800
I gotta call you back later, okay?

672
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,300
All right.

673
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,400
Yeah.

674
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,600
Jack, tactical's just got the schematics ready.

675
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
What are the approach parameters?

676
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
They want us to go in from the west.

677
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,200
Edgar.

678
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,300
This is the composite the sketch artist made based on Richard Heller's description.

679
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,300
Get it to Jack and Tony.

680
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,600
Will do.

681
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Now can we go?

682
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,400
We still have plenty of time to get to Marwan.

683
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
I don't like cutting it this close.

684
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,500
This is a sketch of the guy that Richard Heller described.

685
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,600
He and the girl are our only leads to finding Marwan,

686
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,400
so once we identify the suspects, it is vital that we take them alive.

687
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,700
Manning.

688
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Curtis, it's Jack.

689
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,600
We're getting ready to land.

690
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,700
Is everything set?

691
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,300
Yeah.

692
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,000
We're all set.

693
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,900
Richard's ready to make a positive I.D.

694
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,700
Copy that.

695
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,400
I want you to stay on this channel.

696
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,200
You got it.

697
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,500
We're a go!.

698
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,000
I need you to make sure that no LAPD units go inside our established perimeter!

699
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,900
Am I clear?!

700
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,400
Yes, sir!

701
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,500
Okay, let's go!

702
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:50,800
Are you ready?

703
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,600
They found us.

704
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,900
What are you talking about?

705
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
A helicopter just landed a block away.

706
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,700
So what?

707
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,000
So... they found us.

708
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,300
Damn it!

709
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,100
Hey, we can't go together.

710
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,500
Why not?

711
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,100
Because one of us has to stay here in the apartment.

712
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,000
Why?

713
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,900
Because if they think that we're still here,

714
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,400
then it gives the other a chance to escape.

715
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,800
You've got to be joking.

716
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,800
One of us is going to get caught to save the other?

717
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Exactly.

718
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,700
It's gonna be you.

719
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
Jack, what do you want to do?

720
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,100
Move in on the apartment immediately?

721
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,500
No, I want you and Castle to take up positions here on the roof of the main building in the center of the complex.

722
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,800
Team A, B and C, acknowledge when you're in position.

723
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Team A on site(B, C on site)

724
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,000
Copy that.

725
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,500
Let's go.

726
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,200
Okay.

727
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
LAPD, I need the entry code for the south gate.

728
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,300
I'm in.

729
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,200
Okay, I've got a visual on the apartment.

730
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,300
There's activity inside.

731
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,700
Macallan, meet me at the front door of the apartment.

732
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,000
Have your people cover us.

733
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,400
On my way.

734
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,000
Go.

735
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,600
Pick it.

736
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,600
It's ready.

737
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,600
Put your hands where I can see them!

738
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,000
Put your hands where I can see them now!

739
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,700
He's dead.

740
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
Get a picture of him.

741
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,900
Send it back to CTU.

742
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
Got it.

743
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Tony, this is Jack.

744
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,900
Has anybody reported any outside movement?

745
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,600
No. Why?

746
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,900
The man is dead.

747
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,700
The girl is no longer in the apartment.

748
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,700
She couldn't have gotten past the perimeter teams.

749
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,300
I know, but there are plenty of other places to hide.

750
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,000
I want all teams to maintain their positions until we have time to search the other apartments.

751
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:02,900
Roger that.

752
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,100
All teams, hold position.

753
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,300
Drop your gun.

754
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,000
All right!

755
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,100
All right.

756
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,300
Kick it away.

757
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,200
Look, he's injured.

758
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,400
Why don't you let him go?

759
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,500
You can take me instead.

760
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,100
Your two-way.

761
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,200
Turn around.

762
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,300
On your knees, hands on your head.

763
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,100
Cuff him.

764
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,300
Get up.

765
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,700
Curtis, you should have it.

766
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,600
Whoa.

767
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,400
Is that him?

768
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,500
Is that him?!

769
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,300
Yeah.

770
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,700
Jack, that's him.

771
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,000
We have a positive ID on the picture.

772
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,000
Okay, thank you, Curtis.

773
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,400
Tactical, this is Bauer.

774
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,500
I need five teams of two to initiate a search of the complex.

775
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,400
Start with the outer buildings along the perimeter, move your way in.

776
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,000
Copy that, they're being deployed now.

777
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,900
Tony, this is Jack.

778
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,300
We're initiating the search.

779
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,300
Tony, do you copy?

780
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,700
Castle, why is Almeida not on comm?

781
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,700
Tony you copy? Tony come in!

782
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,900
All teams, this is Bauer.

783
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,600
Castle is down. Almeida is missing.

784
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,300
I repeat: Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage.

785
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,400
Our communications have been compromised.

786
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,100
Move over to secondary frequency.

787
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,700
CTU, I need more tactical personnel now.

788
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
CTU, do you read?

789
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,600
Michelle.

790
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,500
You heard him, people.

791
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Shift profiles.

792
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,300
We may have a hostage situation.

793
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,400
Move.

794
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:23,900
Now!

795
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


796
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,240
I'm just been told a cruise missle, has just

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,660
been launched containing the nuclear warhead?

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,530
Yes, sir, that's correct.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,060
What about Marwan, Jack?

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,050
You think that he will break?

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,380
That won't be easy, sir.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,830
He's planned and organized everything that's happened today,

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,930
Now how am I supposed to be able to fight

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,140
terrorists while I'm provoking a nuclear superpower?

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,570
We marched onto Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,040
and in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,330
The murder of a Chinese consul on Chinese soil could be construed as an act of war.

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,260
I assume you know this man... Howard Bern.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,700
One of your field agents.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,640
A security camera at the Chinese consulate picked up your face.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,550
That's impossible.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,460
I was wearing my mask.

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,790
Trust me, I saw the freeze frame.

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,400
It was you.

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,140
I'm sorry, Jack.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,140
You got to go.

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,370
There's a chopper waiting for you.

23
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,440
It doesn't matter where you take me.

24
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,920
What I want is already happening.

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:06,960
Go!

26
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,400
Notify the perimeter we no longer have Marwan in custody!

27
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,590
Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago. 

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,590
They are taking him back to CTU.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,430
This is a sketch of the guy that Richard Heller described.

30
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,140
He and the girl are our only leads to finding Marwan,

31
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,960
One of us is going to get caught to save the other?

32
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,040
It's gonna be you.

33
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:28,990
Tony, wait.

34
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,100
I can't spend another day without you.

35
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,890
I'm ready...

36
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:33,990
to leave here.

37
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,130
I'm ready to go with you.

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,630
Be careful.

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,570
Almeida, this is Jack.

40
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,890
Has anybody reported any outside movement?

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,560
No, why?

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,840
The man is dead.

43
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,700
The girl is no longer in the apartment.

44
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,150
Tony, do you copy?

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,160
Tony, do you copy?!

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,470
Castle, why is Almeida not on comm?

47
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,070
All teams, this is Bauer.

48
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,940
Castle is down.

49
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,740
Almeida is missing.

50
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,390
I repeat, Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage.

51
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,600
Jack，have you apprehended her?

52
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,100
No, we do not have the female hostile in custody.

53
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,600
She's hiding somewhere here in the apartment complex.

54
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,000
She killed agent Castle, and I believe she's taken Tony Almeida as a hostage.

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,700
Is there any way she slipped the perimeter?

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,060
No.

57
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,900
The perimeter's airtight, but there's over 600 apartments in the complex.

58
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,300
We have to search them room by room.

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
Listen, we need more personnel here.

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,100
Jack, we're running low on manpower.

61
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,100
Damn it, Bill, there's a missile in the air carrying a nuclear warhead.

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
This is our best shot of taking it out before it hits its target.

63
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,700
The White House has us running point with DOD to find the missile.

64
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,700
We're stretched thin.

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Jack, we'll have LAPD send more men,

66
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,800
and we'll send Curtis and another tac team to the location.

67
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,700
Okay, fine.

68
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,820
We've already initiated a search starting with the buildings

69
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,900
nearest the perimeter working our way in, but we need LAPD here now.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Keep us posted.

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,600
Contact division, see if they can spare more men.

72
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,400
I'll call the liaison at LAPD.

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,340
We've almost completed our second satellite pass

74
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,200
over the current flight radius of the missile.

75
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,600
And no sign of it yet?

76
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,100
No, not so far.

77
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,040
What do you think our realistic chances are of being

78
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,100
able to locate the missile with subsequent passes?

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
I don't think they're very good.

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,360
This missile's an s-class.

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
It uses elements of stealth technology.

82
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,000
It was designed to evade detection.

83
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,900
I'm aware of that, but it will still have a heat signature.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, but the lower the missile flies to the ground, the harder it is to pick up.

85
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,400
How much longer until you've completed the second satellite pass?

86
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,700
Uh, less than 20 minutes.

87
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,400
All right, get back to me as soon as you have the results.

88
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,100
All right.

89
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,060
I don't care.

90
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,800
We need every available agent there now.

91
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,060
But they are not clear for field work.

92
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,900
Well, bump up their security level on a provisional basis if you have to.

93
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,000
Call me back with the exact number when you have it.

94
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,600
All right, coordinate that with Edgar Stiles here at comm.

95
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,400
Thanks, Rick.

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,500
What did LAPD say?

97
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,660
They're keeping certain units in reserve...

98
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,800
but they're sending more patrolmen to help Jack, right?

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,330
They're sending nine over there now, and they're

100
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,690
going to try to pull another 12 from east valley.

101
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,200
Nine?

102
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,600
That's not nearly enough.

103
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
We'll have to reassign our people, send them over there now.

104
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
I'm taking care of that, Michelle.

105
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,100
When?

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,500
We need people there now.

107
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,900
This woman has to be captured.

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,600
Michelle.

109
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,800
Everyone understands what's at stake here.

110
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,400
We're going to do our best to find this woman,

111
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,300
but we have to remain calm, or everything will spiral out of control.

112
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,100
You're right... I'm not being objective.

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll admit it.

114
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,810
I'm worried about what this woman might do to Tony,

115
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,200
but I will not lose sight of the big picture.

116
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,100
The big picture is that we have to apprehend this hostile alive.

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Nothing else matters.

118
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,900
What is it, Marwan?

119
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,300
You're late.

120
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
You were supposed to check in.

121
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,500
I know.

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,700
There was a hitch.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,100
Nothing serious.

124
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,500
Um, I am going to be there.

125
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,600
What kind of hitch?

126
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,800
There was a problem in the apartment, and I'm dealing with it.

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
I'm leaving in one hour.

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I'm not waiting for you.

129
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,200
I know, and I'm going to be there.

130
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,500
Well, we don't have much time.

131
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,100
They're very close to finding us, and that would be very, very bad for both of us.

132
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,800
So, tell me, Tony, two years ago,

133
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,300
you put Michelle Dessler's life ahead of national security.

134
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,300
You let a suspect escape, and you committed treason.

135
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,800
Is she going to do the same for you?

136
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Mike, it's Audrey Raines.

137
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes, Audrey, what have you got?

138
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,900
Well, the second satellite pass is complete.

139
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,600
We were unable to detect the missile with thermal imaging.

140
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,400
There's just too much radiant heat from ground sources.

141
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,800
Ms. Raines, this is President Palmer.

142
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,900
Is there a chance another satellite pass will find the missile?

143
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,300
Well, the more data we have, Mr. President, the better,

144
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,900
but a more intensive pass will take two to three hours.

145
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
And we expect the missile to find its target before then.

146
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Yes, sir, we do.

147
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,500
All right.

148
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,000
Make sure FBI's on a real time link with all local emergency channels.

149
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,400
All right. I'll get that done right now.

150
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,220
I also want you to compile disaster scenarios

151
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,900
for the urban centers within range of the missiles.

152
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,100
Sir, that's 20 of the largest cities in this country.

153
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm aware of that.

154
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,420
I want death rates, fallout patterns, emergency

155
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,500
response predictions laid out for all of them.

156
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,500
Yes, sir, I'll take care of that right now.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Thank you, Ms. Raines.

158
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,500
As additional teams arrive on site, assign them sections of the grid.

159
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,560
We do not want people bumping into each other.

160
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
If the subject is spotted, what's the approach protocol?

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,350
We maximize for capture.

162
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,700
There can be no lag time.

163
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,100
Don't you want to evaluate the formation since she's got Tony hostage?

164
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,300
We proceed as if there is no hostage.

165
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,900
There is only one operational objective, and that is to capture this woman.

166
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,400
Make sure that's the profile you send out to all the teams.

167
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,900
Understand?

168
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,800
Yes.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,700
Dessler.

170
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Why don't you get somewhere private where we can talk?

171
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,200
Who is this?

172
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm sending you the answer.

173
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,700
Tony!

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Now do you know who this is?

175
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
And don't bother trying to triangulate the call.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,100
It's scrambled.

177
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,500
Please...

178
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,460
don't hurt him.

179
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,800
He's okay for now, but he won't be unless you do everything that I say, Michelle.

180
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,900
I understand.

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
I need your help getting out of here.

182
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,400
Wh... what kind of help?

183
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,900
You're hesitating.

184
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm not, I'm not.

185
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I just need to know what you want me to do.

186
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Your men are between me and my exit.

187
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,400
I need to know what their search patterns are and how many men there are.

188
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,300
Okay, okay, I'll find out.

189
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,900
You'll tell me right now.

190
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,790
I have to go downstairs and talk to my tactical team.

191
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,100
Oh, Michelle, you're stalling.

192
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
How many men are there total?

193
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,400
Upwards of 30, not including LAPD, and reinforcements are on the way.

194
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,500
You will need you to remove your men from the northeast driveway of the complex

195
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
I... I... I don't know if I can do that.

196
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,300
You will redeploy your men by the time I call you back, or Tony dies.

197
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,300
When are you calling back?

198
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,400
Soon.

199
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,900
Get moving, Michelle.

200
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
Well, she still loves you.

201
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,900
The question is how much.

202
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Edgar Stiles.

203
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,500
Edgar, send the deployment group to my screen.

204
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,160
It's updating.

205
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,700
Want the last version, or do you want to wait?

206
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,700
Just send it!

207
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,600
Are LAPD reinforcements there yet?

208
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,600
They're outside now.

209
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,200
Some will be there in 15 minutes.

210
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
You want me to send the updated grid when it comes in?

211
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,700
Ms. Dessler?

212
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,100
Yes.

213
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,200
Yes, do that.

214
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,110
No, no, we can't eliminate the midwest, or

215
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,700
any region within the missile's flying range.

216
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,600
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

217
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,900
This warhead could hit anywhere.

218
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,800
We're still putting together the projected casualty numbers.

219
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,900
We just know they're gonna be high.

220
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,700
Yeah.

221
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,900
Where are we on the search of the apartment complex?

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Nothing so far.

223
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,100
LAPD there yet?

224
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,600
They're on their way.

225
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,200
I'll be at comm.

226
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,200
I can't do this.

227
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,800
You can't do what?

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,600
I can't...

229
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,000
sacrifice the lives of all those people if this warhead goes off.

230
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,200
She called me.

231
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,300
Who?

232
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,100
Who called you?

233
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,200
The hostile who has Tony.

234
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,700
When?

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,800
What did she say?

236
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,800
A couple minutes ago.

237
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,400
She said to redeploy our men so she can get away.

238
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,300
Or Tony dies.

239
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,400
Yes, sir.

240
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Patch me through to Jack Bauer's comm.

241
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,500
Right away.

242
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,100
Take your team.

243
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
Start working the second floor, building 11.

244
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,100
Jack, you read me?

245
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,100
Yeah, I copy.

246
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,200
We've got something.

247
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,900
The suspect contacted Michelle.

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,100
She confirmed she's holding Tony hostage.

249
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,500
She's trying to use him as leverage against Michelle to open up an escape route.

250
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,700
Is Michelle there?

251
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm right here, Jack.

252
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,600
Do we have any idea where she is?

253
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
She wants me to clear a path in the northeast driveway.

254
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,100
She's going to call to confirm that I did it.

255
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,700
When?

256
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,600
I don't know.

257
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Could be any second.

258
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,500
Michelle, I want you to make her believe that you're still cooperating with her.

259
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,100
I need you to draw her into the open.

260
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,400
I promise you that we will do everything we can for Tony.

261
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,500
Okay.

262
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,800
Stay ready for her call.

263
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,000
Bill, I'm gonna pull all our units out of the northeast driveway,

264
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,260
put them in concealed positions outside the complex.

265
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,100
It's still possible she'll change her mind at

266
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,900
the last minute and try another escape route.

267
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I know, and we'll be ready for that, but if she doesn't,

268
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,000
I want her to believe that Michelle's still complying.

269
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,500
As soon as she's 50 yards outside of the complex and

270
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,800
can't reenter... that's when our teams will converge.

271
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,500
Let me know when your men are ready to redeploy.

272
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,700
Copy that.

273
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,500
You all right?

274
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,500
Yeah.

275
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,300
I was gonna do what she wanted.

276
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,500
Michelle...

277
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,700
I didn't call you right away.

278
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,900
All I could think of, at first, was saving Tony's life.

279
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,900
It's okay.

280
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,500
It's done.

281
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,500
All designated teams, prepare to move into your secondary positions on my command.

282
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,200
Curtis?

283
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,300
What do you need me to do?

284
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,500
Some of the residents aren't cooperating with the search.

285
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,920
I want you to have LAPD units start

286
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,700
arresting anybody that's giving us a problem.

287
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,500
You got it.

288
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,600
Why don't we pull some of the resources off the search?

289
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,290
We have a better chance of finding the hostile

290
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,600
through her communication with Michelle.

291
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:42,860
No.

292
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,400
The hostile's gonna be looking for any sign that Michelle's betrayed her.

293
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,900
We have to follow procedure as if we have no idea they've been in contact.

294
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,000
Understood.

295
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,400
As soon as you're done with LAPD, I need you with me.

296
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:52,800
You got it.

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Bill, this is Jack.

298
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,200
Do you copy?

299
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,900
Yeah, Jack.

300
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,500
We're ready to go down here.

301
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,400
Any new communication with the hostile?

302
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,560
No.

303
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,200
Michelle's still waiting for her call.

304
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,900
Have you been able to make any kind of id on scene?

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,480
Forensics tried to pull prints from her last

306
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,100
known position, but they came up with nothing.

307
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,300
Same result here.

308
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,000
No match on the voiceprint.

309
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
She's managed to stay completely under the radar.

310
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,200
We're gonna have to hope that because how fast this is moving,

311
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,100
she slips up and makes a mistake.

312
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,400
Otherwise, we're in trouble.

313
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Proceed when ready, Jack.

314
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,700
We're standing by.

315
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,700
Copy that.

316
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,300
All northeast driveway teams, move in to secondary positions.

317
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:24,800
We're a go.

318
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,760
Hi.

319
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,730
What are you doing?

320
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,200
Hey.

321
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,660
You were supposed to stay in your apartment.

322
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,300
Don't you know there's some crazy person loose in the building?

323
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah, I know, I know.

324
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,000
Hey, man.

325
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,700
Where's Joz?

326
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,900
He just got up.

327
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,300
Can you just get him, 'cause I just need to talk to him?

328
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,200
Something happened.

329
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,200
Joz.

330
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:23,900
What's going on?

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,500
Nothing.

332
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,100
Just weird stuff.

333
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,800
What?

334
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,760
Nothing.

335
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,500
Why don't you just tell me?

336
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,600
No, it's cool.

337
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,200
Hey, what's going on, Rothenberg?

338
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,800
Hey, man.

339
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,400
How are you?

340
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,400
Not a sound.

341
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,100
I just got off a very disturbing phone call from the Chinese foreign secretary.

342
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,600
So they're still pressing us on the attack on the consulate?

343
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,200
It's much worse than that, David.

344
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,100
The fallout from that attack you authorized is escalating.

345
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
They're determined to pin this on us.

346
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,560
If they manage to confirm that this is one of our men,

347
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,200
I don't have to tell you what kind of a disaster that would be.

348
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,800
No, sir, you don't.

349
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,170
But this alone is not conclusive enough for the

350
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,800
Chinese to turn this into an international incident.

351
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,160
But if they find corroborating evidence?

352
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,050
CTU is doing whatever they can to prevent that from happening,

353
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,900
including getting this agent out of sight until it blows over.

354
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,240
I know I gave you the authority to make the decision,

355
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,500
but you never should have ordered that assault.

356
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,500
If we hadn't carried out the raid, sir, we'd be nowhere on stopping the missile.

357
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,900
And where are we, David?

358
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,700
Is there some progress I don't know about?

359
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,900
CTU is closing in on one of Marwan's associates.

360
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,850
If they apprehend her in time, they feel that they can use her to find Marwan.

361
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,900
Do you know how speculative that sounds?

362
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,400
My god, we're never gonna find it in time.

363
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,100
Don't say that!

364
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,400
We will stop it.

365
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,800
But you must believe that if you're gonna lead today.

366
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,760
How am I gonna believe that?

367
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,700
Every second that passes brings that missile

368
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,000
closer to its target, which for all we know, is us.

369
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
We are not sitting on our hands, Mr. President.

370
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,500
We are using every resource at our disposal to find this missile.

371
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,300
We will prevent the warhead from going off.

372
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,700
I wish I was as confident as you are.

373
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,500
You need to be.

374
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,900
Remain Presidential.

375
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,800
Demand nothing less than success from your people, and you will get it.

376
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,300
All right.

377
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,300
All right.

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,500
What do I tell the Chinese foreign secretary when I talk to him next?

379
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:01,900
You don't.

380
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,100
Let Mike handle this.

381
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,500
You'll tell them, unless they have proof of our involvement,

382
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,200
you don't want to hear from them today.

383
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,800
Mr. Buchanan, Agent Bern on six.

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
Send it to my cell phone.

385
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,600
Yes, sir.

386
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,900
Buchanan.

387
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,360
It's Agent Bern, sir.

388
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
I got a message to call you as soon as I landed in San Diego.

389
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Are we on a secure line?

390
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Yes, sir, it's an encrypted cell.

391
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,850
The Chinese are continuing to press the case that

392
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,000
we were involved in the assault on their consulate.

393
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,200
Have they managed to find evidence beyond the surveillance video of me?

394
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,700
No.

395
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,200
And we have to make sure they don't.

396
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,200
I want you to start fabricating an alibi with CTU in San Diego.

397
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,500
I want you to make it to look like you were working there during the assault.

398
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,800
Our transport's arriving right now, sir.

399
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,200
I'll get right on it.

400
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,000
The alibi has to withstand careful scrutiny.

401
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,800
The San Diego phone logs, rosters, and mainframe records all have to back it up.

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,100
It'll be airtight, sir.

403
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,800
It has to be.

404
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,600
Sir, about my family.

405
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,600
Do you think there's any chance that the Chinese will try to get to them?

406
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,600
They can't.

407
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,680
We've already contacted your wife, and we've moved

408
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,500
her and your kids to a hotel for the time being.

409
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,100
I'll be in touch, Agent Bern.

410
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,100
Thank you very much, sir.

411
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,700
Drive!

412
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,200
What the hell is this?

413
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,100
I think you already know what "this" is.

414
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,300
CTU sent a team into our consulate just a few hours ago.

415
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,500
You were on the team, and our consulate general was killed.

416
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,300
You're going to tell me who was responsible.

417
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

418
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,700
Really?

419
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,500
Then why were you being transported here by helicopter from CTU Los Angeles?

420
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
You don't know where I came from.

421
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,600
Actually, I do.

422
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,100
Before entering CTU earlier tonight, we turned our satellite on that location.

423
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,500
While I was questioning your superiors,

424
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,500
our satellite picked up someone being taken away by helicopter.

425
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,400
So what?

426
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,800
That wasn't me.

427
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,800
No, it was you!

428
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,620
The Chinese government insists that someone

429
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,800
take responsibility for the death of our consul.

430
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,200
What does that mean...

431
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,700
"take responsibility"?

432
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,000
Now, I believe you were only following orders.

433
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,000
Tell us who gave the orders, and I'll let you go.

434
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,300
I'm not telling you anything.

435
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,200
I believe you're going to change your mind.

436
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,860
Yes?

437
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,300
Have you redeployed all your men?

438
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,600
Yes, I have.

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,360
Bill?

440
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,900
It's Jack.

441
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,900
Uplink is on.

442
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,000
Are you sure they followed your instructions?

443
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,400
I'm sure.

444
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,100
It's starting to rain pretty hard, Jack.

445
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,700
Michelle...

446
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,300
do you love Tony?

447
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Yes, I love him.

448
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,200
Good.

449
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,160
Because if I find out that you're trying to play me,

450
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,600
the very first thing I'm going to do is blow his brains out,

451
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,000
and don't think that there's anything you can do to stop it,

452
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,800
'cause there's not, understand?

453
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,200
Okay, I understand.

454
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,000
Good.

455
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,000
Stay by the phone.

456
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,700
All comm analysts, clone this call and filter it through all our servers.

457
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,400
Do you have a multiple source on audio?

458
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,000
- No. Just one Telco feed... low res. - No, I know the configuration, Edgar.

459
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,900
I need to know if we can multiplex, pull some background noise off.

460
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,500
We need to pinpoint the source.

461
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
I was going to do that.

462
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:04,960
When?

463
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,200
This is happening now!

464
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,570
I shouldn't have to walk you through this, damn it!

465
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,800
You don't have to walk me through this.

466
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,900
I'm setting it up now.

467
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,500
Go to delta two, Edgar.

468
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,300
It's all there.

469
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,400
I will not let this thing fall apart because of technical incompetence.

470
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
All right, I've got confirmation.

471
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,230
All our visible forces have been pulled

472
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,600
away from this street all the way to western.

473
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,400
Okay, good.

474
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,600
Jack.

475
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,600
We've got something.

476
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,500
Building three, west entrance.

477
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,900
Edgar, video feed.

478
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,800
Yes?

479
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
Okay, Michelle, we're on our way.

480
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,500
Okay, it's them.

481
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,000
I've got a gun on Tony.

482
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,460
My finger's on the trigger.

483
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,600
If I move it, he's going to die.

484
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,600
I told you, I moved my men.

485
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,300
She's completely in the open.

486
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,100
She's running a huge risk exposing herself like that.

487
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,200
So far, so good.

488
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,300
She's crossing the street.

489
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,000
When she gets into the car, she can't stay on top of him.

490
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,100
That's our opportunity.

491
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,100
She's moving towards the black jag.

492
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,200
All teams, hold your position

493
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,900
Okay, here's the deal.

494
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
As soon as we're in the car and we've cleared the area,

495
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,800
I'm going to call you, and I'm going to tell you where you can find Tony.

496
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,600
Okay.

497
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
All right, move, move.

498
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,100
Bill, not yet.

499
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,400
All teams stand down!

500
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,500
I see your men, Michelle.

501
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,760
You lied to me, you bitch.

502
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,500
You are not going to take me alive, got it?

503
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,200
No!

504
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
No!

505
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,400
Bill, they're gone.

506
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,800
She blew herself up in the car, and she took Tony with her.

507
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,400
They're gone.

508
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,300
I understand Bill Buchanan requested a conference call.

509
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,860
Yes, sir.

510
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,300
We were waiting for you to begin.

511
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,300
Bill, we're all here, go ahead.

512
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,400
I'm afraid that Marwan's associate-

513
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,200
the woman we hoped would help us locate the missile

514
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
has killed herself and one of our agents.

515
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,000
Oh, my god.

516
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,800
Bill, did she leave behind any physical evidence that could help us?

517
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,100
It doesn't appear so.

518
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,200
So, what is CTU going to do now to find the missile?

519
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,300
Mr. President, at this point,

520
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,700
CTU no longer has any reasonable expectation of

521
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,000
finding the missile before it reaches its target.

522
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,900
This is it, it's going to happen.

523
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,000
What do we do?

524
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,800
At this point, we have no choice but to alert all state and federal agencies,

525
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,600
and focus all our resources on managing the aftermath.

526
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
But we don't even know the missile's target.

527
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
We can assume it will be a major city.

528
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,400
But no matter what the target is,

529
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,600
there will be widespread panic across this country.

530
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,200
We need to mobilize the army and the national guard in every state,

531
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,300
and draw up a declaration of martial law.

532
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,100
Yes, we need to do that.

533
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,600
Bill, all federal agencies need to prepare for the aftermath of a nuclear attack.

534
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,300
CTU's priority should be disaster management.

535
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,200
Redeploy your people now.

536
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Understood.

537
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,160
Edgar Stiles.

538
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,800
Edgar, tell Jack the field operation is over.

539
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,800
Have him bring his people back here immediately.

540
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,500
Got it.

541
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,300
The worst disaster in this country's history is taking place on my watch!

542
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
I gave you the responsibility to stop this.

543
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,800
You failed me, David.

544
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,300
And you failed your country.

545
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
I can't even imagine what you must be feeling.

546
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,800
I know...

547
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,300
part of you is second-guessing your decision...

548
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:52,500
but you couldn't place Tony's life before the lives of potentially millions of people.

549
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,100
You made exactly the decision Tony would have wanted you to make.

550
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,200
That's our job.

551
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,900
That's why we signed on.

552
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,700
We decided we were going to leave this.

553
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,000
Go somewhere and start again.

554
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,500
Michelle...

555
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,660
I want to get back to work.

556
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,900
We still have to find this missile.

557
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,400
No, I want you to go home.

558
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,600
I'll be okay, Bill.

559
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,000
That's not advice.

560
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,200
That's an order.

561
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,000
Buchanan.

562
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,200
Sir, Jack says he's not pulling his men out yet.

563
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,200
Did you tell him we have orders from the White House?

564
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah, but he says he's not ready.

565
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,000
Put him on the video phone in the situation room.

566
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,100
You lied to me, you bitch.

567
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,500
You are not going to take me alive, got it?

568
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:57,960
Play it again.

569
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,800
Give me more damn volume on the phone call.

570
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,780
Jack, we need to redeploy.

571
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,600
Just do it!

572
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,300
Jack.

573
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,100
Tony's gone.

574
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,100
I'm sorry, Curtis.

575
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,100
Just play it again, please.

576
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,600
Okay.

577
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Jack, you've got a phone call.

578
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,100
This is Bauer.

579
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,000
Jack, why haven't you redeployed?

580
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,860
The operation's over.

581
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,860
The hostile killed herself.

582
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,260
Because it doesn't make any sense, Bill.

583
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,340
Everything that we know about this woman tells

584
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,300
us that she's a professional, not a fanatic.

585
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,300
We had her cornered.

586
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,100
Her next move was to try and negotiate for her freedom, not kill herself.

587
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,900
In theory, I agree with you, but you saw what I saw.

588
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
All I saw were two darkened figures in the rain concealed by an umbrella,

589
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,500
and an explosion, and I saw that from half a block away.

590
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,700
Jack, you've got to focus now.

591
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,600
Nobody here is holding you responsible for Tony's death.

592
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,500
You got to let this go.

593
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,400
Bill, you're not listening to me.

594
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,900
Jack, we reviewed the tactical feed.

595
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,400
There is nothing to suggest we were deceived.

596
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,100
Look, I know Tony was your friend,

597
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,680
and you probably feel responsible for getting him involved today.

598
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,400
This is not about Tony!

599
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,800
This is about her,

600
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,160
and until I can absolutely confirm that she is dead,

601
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,900
I am maintaining this perimeter, and I am going to continue this search.

602
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,100
Jack, I'm working under orders from the White House.

603
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,100
You have ten minutes, then I want you to move out.

604
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,300
Can you enhance the image from here?

605
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,200
Not in the field.

606
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,200
Then play it again

607
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Okay, here's the deal.

608
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,200
I still can't hear the audio properly.

609
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,300
Give me a headset.

610
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,400
I'm going to call you, and I'm going to tell you where you can find Tony.

611
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,600
I see your men, Michelle.

612
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,900
You lied to me, you bitch.

613
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,500
You are not going to take me alive, got it?

614
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,300
Play back the last 15 seconds.

615
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,200
What are you seeing, Jack?

616
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,500
It's not what I'm seeing.

617
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Come on, play it back.

618
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,300
I see your men, Michelle.

619
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,700
You lied to me, you bitch.

620
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,000
It was pouring rain.

621
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,900
You can see it bouncing off the car.

622
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
You can't hear it on her side of the phone call.

623
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,000
She was making that call from somewhere else...

624
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,500
indoors.

625
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,100
She'd want a position that would give her a clear line of sight to the car.

626
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,900
That would put her in the building that the couple exited from.

627
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,500
Get the teams ready; we're moving in now.

628
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,300
Alert all teams.

629
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,800
We'll converge on building 11.

630
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,200
Well, they're heading back in.

631
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,400
Looks like my neighbors died for nothing.

632
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
They know you're still in here.

633
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
Open up the palm of your hand.

634
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,600
Here are the keys.

635
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,100
Take off your cuffs.

636
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,700
Put these on.

637
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,800
We're getting out of here.

638
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,400
Okay, now cuff yourself back up.

639
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,200
Let's go.

640
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,600
We got every way in and out of the building covered,

641
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,500
and we got men on every floor going room by room.

642
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,700
We need to take her alive.

643
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,900
Everyone's aware.

644
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,900
Agent Bauer.

645
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,700
Yeah?

646
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,400
We found fresh blood outside an apartment.

647
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,100
Where?

648
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,300
208.

649
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,700
Stand down until we get there.

650
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,200
Copy that.

651
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,500
Curtis take the door.

652
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,600
Curtis, she went this way.

653
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,600
Turn around.

654
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,800
Move.

655
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,900
Don't move!

656
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,700
Drop the gun!

657
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,800
It's over!

658
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,800
Take one more step, and I'll kill him.

659
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,900
Do it, Jack.

660
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Do what you have to do.

661
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,500
Shut up.

662
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,220
Do you really have what it takes to let me

663
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,700
kill him while you're looking him in the eye?

664
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,400
Yes.

665
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,200
I believe you.

666
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,100
So what's to stop me from shooting him?

667
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,900
You can't...

668
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,800
kill me, can you?

669
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,300
You need me.

670
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,400
Tony.

671
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,800
Hostile is down.

672
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,500
I repeat, the hostile is down.

673
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,060
Get a medic down here.

674
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,800
I want her conscious as soon as possible.

675
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,700
Look at me.

676
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,000
You okay?

677
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,200
You okay?

678
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,800
Yeah.

679
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,600
Get me that medic now!

680
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,400
He's on his way.

681
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,400
Does Michelle know I'm alive?

682
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,000
No, not yet.

683
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,700
I'll call CTU on my cell so you can talk to her privately.

684
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,500
Thanks.

685
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,200
Buchanan.

686
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,200
Bill, this is Jack.

687
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,060
Jack, what's going on?

688
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,300
Have you redeployed back to CTU?

689
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,660
No.

690
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,000
We just apprehended the hostile.

691
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,200
What?

692
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,000
She's unconscious, but she's unharmed.

693
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,000
Tony's okay, too.

694
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,400
Thank god.

695
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,300
I'll alert the White House.

696
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:15,900
Okay, good.

697
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Bill, Tony wants to talk to Michelle.

698
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,800
Can you put her on the line?

699
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,050
She's not here.

700
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,800
I sent her home.

701
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,460
I'll, uh...

702
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,100
I'll find her and patch her through to your cell.

703
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,900
Thanks.

704
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:51,900
Hello?

705
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Michelle, it's Bill.

706
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,300
Tony's alive.

707
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,800
What?

708
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,400
He wasn't in the car.

709
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,000
He's okay.

710
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,500
I'll let Tony explain it to you.

711
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,700
Hold on for him.

712
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,800
Michelle, it's me.

713
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,400
Tony?

714
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,900
Oh, my god...

715
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,300
it's okay, honey.

716
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,200
Oh, my god...

717
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,200
what happened?

718
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,600
She made somebody else wear my clothes.

719
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,600
She needed to keep me alive until she got out.

720
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,900
Jack figured it out.

721
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,600
He was able to save me.

722
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,400
I don't know what to say.

723
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,600
Look, you don't have to say anything, sweetheart.

724
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,350
I'm coming to CTU right now.

725
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,500
I'll see you in a few minutes.

726
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,200
Michelle...

727
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,500
I love you.

728
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
I love you, Tony.

729
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,200
Get President Palmer patch through.

730
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,700
We're going to have to structure a deal.

731
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,500
Yeah, all right.

732
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,600
She's conscious.

733
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,500
Pick her up!

734
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,100
Call the White House now.

735
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,500
Where is Marwan?

736
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
That's what I thought.

737
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,700
We're both professionals.

738
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,500
You know that I can force this information out of you, but I'm running out of time.

739
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,160
We never get second chances in our line of work, but I'm going to give you one.

740
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,840
I have the power to give you a deal signed by the President of the

741
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,600
United States that grants you immunity from past and present crimes.

742
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,440
In exchange, you're going to help me find Marwan

743
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,500
and stop this warhead from hitting its target.

744
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,300
Do you understand?

745
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,400
Do you understand?

746
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,600
You are either going to help me now, or I will kill you.

747
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,100
Show me the deal.

748
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,600
You were part of the covert team that mounted the assault on our consulate...

749
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,700
an operation that resulted in the death of our consul.

750
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Who led the mission?

751
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,600
Who is responsible for what happened?

752
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

753
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,800
Please, Mr. Bern, you're wasting time.

754
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,900
Give us a statement, and we'll release you.

755
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,460
I'm telling you the truth,

756
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,800
and you're going to have to release me as soon as CTU realizes what's happened to me.

757
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,700
Actually, Mr. Bern...

758
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,000
no one will ever know, and we will never tell them.

759
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,800
What are you talking about?

760
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,800
The China queen container ship is moored at the port of San Diego.

761
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,100
If you don't give us our statement, we'll put you on board,

762
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,300
and you will arrive in 18 days in the port of Hangzhou.

763
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,000
Then we will transport you 2,800 miles to the province of Xinjiang,

764
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,980
where you will be remanded to the maximum

765
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,600
security labor camp on the border with Siberia.

766
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
You wouldn't do that.

767
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,300
Why wouldn't we, Mr. Bern?

768
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,900
We want justice.

769
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,610
If you're not going to tell us who was ultimately responsible

770
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,100
for the situation at the consulate, that leaves you.

771
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Your wife and your two daughters will not be notified.

772
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,500
The U.S. Government will not be notified.

773
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,500
Therefore, there will be no chance for prisoner exchange.

774
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,400
There will be positively no chance of escape...

775
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,200
for the rest of your life.

776
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Decide, Mr. Bern.

777
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,300
The China queen is on a tight schedule.

778
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,300
I don't know.

779
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,900
All we want is a name...

780
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,820
a recorded statement naming the person

781
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,700
responsible for what happened at the consulate.

782
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,400
Then...

783
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,600
Then what happens?

784
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,300
You will walk right out of that door.

785
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,500
No, I meant...

786
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,200
to him.

787
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,700
As I said...

788
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
all we want is justice.

789
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,800
His name...

790
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,200
is Jack Bauer.

791
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


792
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


﻿1
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,130
The Chinese are continuing to press the case

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,190
that we were involved in the assault on their consulate.

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,250
Have they managed to find evidence

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,720
beyond the surveillance video of me?

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,890
No... and we have to make sure they don't.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,140
You were part of the covert team

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,540
that mounted the assault on our consulate.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,440
If you're not going to tell us who was ultimately responsible,

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,140
that leaves you.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,030
If it's Stealth, we can't track it by radar.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,320
Those missiles travel at a speed of 600 miles an hour,

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,180
which means it could hit a target on either coast in under three hours.

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,100
That's assuming it's headed for the coast.

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,460
If it's not, it could hit its target at any time.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,830
What is CTU going to do now to find the missile?

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,320
At this point, CTU no longer has any reasonable expectation

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,800
of finding the missile before it reaches its target.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,040
I gave you the responsibility to stop this.

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,490
You failed me, David.

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,040
And you failed your country.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,790
Drop the gun!

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,730
- It's over.  - Do it, Jack.

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,310
Do you really have what it takes to let me kill him

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,710
- while you're looking him in the eye?  - Yeah.

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,740
Tony...

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,850
I have the power to give you a deal

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,770
signed by the President of the United States.

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,850
In exchange, you're going to help me find Marwan

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,350
and stop this warhead from hitting its target.

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,160
Show me the deal.

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,720
Bill, this is Jack.

32
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,370
Has the President signed the pardon yet?

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,770
Any minute now.

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,950
I don't like that we're cutting this woman a deal, Jack.

35
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,520
We can't verify she's telling the truth until it's too late.

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,350
But we don't have a choice.

37
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,240
Right now, she's the only person that can lead us to Marwan,

38
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,950
and Marwan's controlling the missile.

39
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,160
Has the Attorney General reviewed this immunity agreement?

40
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:55,520
Yes, sir.

41
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,790
We should be getting his final approval any minute now.

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,640
Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt,

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,580
but there's something you might want to see.

44
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,340
It may affect the immunity agreement.

45
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,020
What is it, Aaron?

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,000
The woman you're about to pardon...

47
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,890
I'm pretty certain you've met her before.

48
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,440
Explain.

49
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,530
May I?

50
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,410
Absolutely.

51
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,430
On the right

52
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,560
is the hostile we have in custody.

53
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,800
On the left,

54
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,640
this is news footage from four-and-a-half years ago in Los Angeles

55
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,240
moments before the attempt on your life.

56
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,620
You're telling me the woman

57
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,480
we're about to cut a deal with

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,530
tried to assassinate me?

59
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,300
Yes, sir.

60
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,520
Novick.

61
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,730
All right. Thank you.

62
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,930
Mr. President, Attorney General says

63
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,820
the immunity agreement is in order,

64
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,140
ready to be signed.

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,730
If I read this document right,

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,510
it grants immunity not only for what this woman has done today,

67
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,470
but for any crimes she's ever committed in the past.

68
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,400
That is correct,sir.

69
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,010
Sign it.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,730
We're trying to get you the deal,

71
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,950
but we will pull it if the missile hits first.

72
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,190
I will talk when my representatives confirm my immunity.

73
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,010
Not before.

74
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,440
- Manning.  - Is the hostage there at the moment?

75
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,280
Yeah.

76
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,840
She's right here.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,060
- I'm listening...  - I have just seen the paper signed by Mr. President.

78
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,330
- Is the paperwork in order?  - Yes. What you want me to do?

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,090
Good.

80
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,390
Where is Marwan?

81
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,090
The Global Center.

82
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,190
A helicopter is waiting for him on the roof

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,310
that will be taking him to a ship.

84
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,120
If he flies low enough, he'll evade radar.

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,350
When is he leaving?

86
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,640
Now.

87
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Get the chopper ready.

88
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,790
Alpha Four, it's Manning. Have the chooper ready.

89
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,550
She stays here until we verify this.

90
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,280
Simmons, this is Bernhard. What's your 20?

91
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,690
Capturing Marwan alive

92
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,320
is our only chance of stopping this warhead

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,660
from hitting its target.

94
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,090
We are not to use lethal force even in self-defense.

95
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,920
Am I clear?

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,310
Got it, Jack

97
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,910
Let's go!

98
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,860
She's not answering her phone.

99
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,720
She should have been here already.

100
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,950
She said she was delayed.

101
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,830
We're not waiting.

102
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,100
How long before we get to the ship and international waters?

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,330
Ten minutes.

104
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,960
Something's wrong.

105
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,060
Edgar, it's Jack.

106
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,150
We're almost there.

107
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,170
Have you got confirmation on the target?

108
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,400
We just repositioned the satellite.

109
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,200
The images are coming through now.

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,020
There, on top of the Global Center

111
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,130
I see a chopper.

112
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,060
Southeast corner.

113
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,590
Copy that.

114
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,660
I want you to take a southeast approach.

115
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,900
- Stay below the building.  - Yes, sir.

116
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,320
Missile's still on target.

117
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,720
We've got to get out of here.

118
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,560
Just a few minutes until we're up to speed.

119
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,560
- Roger that. We're on the building approaching the northwest.  - OK. I copy that.

120
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,870
- Okay, come up over the building now!  - Yes, sir.

121
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't let him take off!

122
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,270
Stay above him!

123
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,390
Go! Go!

124
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,760
I can't! He's right on top of me.

125
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,280
Go!

126
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,330
The engine's out!

127
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,560
Put me in a position to bail.

128
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,450
There he is!

129
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,990
I got you covered.

130
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,550
Clear!

131
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,420
No!

132
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,790
Tell me where the missile is.

133
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,410
Tell me where it is.

134
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,070
Tell me where it is.

135
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,920
No!

136
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,260
No!

137
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,930
I don't understand. Bauer had orders to take Marwan alive.

138
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,450
I'm sure Jack did whatever he could.

139
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,710
That's not good enough, David.

140
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,860
CTU is searching Marwan's helicopter,

141
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,630
trying to find something that will help them locate the missile.

142
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,570
We're out of time.

143
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,710
Not yet.

144
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,080
Mr. President...

145
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,050
I'm sorry to add to an already difficult situation,

146
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,620
but the acting Chinese consul, Su Ming, is on teleconference.

147
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,050
He says it's urgent.

148
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,170
Put him through.

149
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,090
Gentlemen...

150
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,050
as we discussed earlier,

151
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,530
our consulate in Los Angeles

152
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,850
was attacked three hours ago.

153
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,290
A Chinese citizen was abducted,

154
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,890
and our consul killed.

155
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,250
We've already given you our assurance

156
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,250
that we had no knowledge of this reprehensible attack.

157
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,620
Which is strange,

158
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,150
since one of your agents has confessed his direct involvement

159
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,750
and implicated his superior, as well.

160
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,380
What are you talking about?

161
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,670
My name is Howard Bern.

162
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,210
I'm a federal agent with the Counter-Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles,

163
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,290
speaking of my own free will, under no duress.

164
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,930
I participated in an unlawful assault

165
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,550
on the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.

166
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,470
I was acting under the orders of Special Advisor

167
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,450
to the Secretary of Defense...

168
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,710
Jack Bauer.

169
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,660
Mr. Bern provided details which leave no doubt

170
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,570
that he is telling the truth.

171
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,480
The full tape will be forwarded to you immediately.

172
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,810
Putting aside the question of

173
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,320
how this so-called confession was obtained,

174
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,620
what does your government expect us to do?

175
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,900
Mr. Bauer committed a crime at our consulate,

176
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,370
which is Chinese territory.

177
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
If he was acting without your approval,

178
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,260
he should be turned over to our government

179
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,240
to be tried and sentenced according to our laws.

180
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,370
Mr. Su, we'll get back to you.

181
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,060
Damn it, David, you said this would be handled.

182
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,170
I'm sure the Chinese don't want war.

183
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,680
No. But they do want to embarrass us,

184
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,600
take the moral high ground

185
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,270
in the court of world opinion.

186
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,030
Well, we need to take the least-damaging course of action.

187
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,550
Unfortunately, then, there's only one option.

188
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,570
Which is?

189
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,430
We hand Bauer over to the Chinese.

190
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,860
Unacceptable.

191
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,540
Besides, if we turn him over,

192
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,870
he'll implicate this administration.

193
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,830
The Chinese made Bern talk.

194
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,200
They'll do the same with Bauer, eventually.

195
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,240
Jack Bauer would never compromise national security.

196
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,110
As much as I'd like to believe that, everyone breaks.

197
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,770
What you believe is irrelevant.

198
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,160
There is another option, Mr. President.

199
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,620
Go on.

200
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,960
Suppose something happens to Bauer?

201
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,520
Suppose he has an accident?

202
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,910
That's an obscene suggestion.

203
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,660
It solves a lot of problems.

204
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,700
Mr. President!

205
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,980
This administration does not condone murder.

206
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,630
And it never will.

207
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,160
Is that clear?

208
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,820
Yes, sir.

209
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm sorry, sir.

210
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,280
Did you find anything on Marwan's body?

211
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,990
- We're still looking.  - Are you okay?

212
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,390
I'll be a lot better once we take this missile down.

213
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,110
Sir, we might have found something in here.

214
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,980
What is it? It's been shot up pretty badly,

215
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,890
but one of the drive platforms is intact.

216
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,030
It's some kind of tracking or navigation program with a GPS node.

217
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,220
Adams is uplinking whatever's left to CTU.

218
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,860
Okay, thanks.

219
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,040
Buchanan.

220
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,630
Bill, it's Jack. Forensics found something.

221
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,090
- They sent it over...  - Chloe's got it.

222
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,150
She and Edgar are trying to download the interface.

223
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,940
How close are they?

224
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,730
I'll put you on speaker.

225
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,390
You're on, Jack.

226
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,070
Chloe, have you got anything on that program?

227
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,730
Nothing yet.

228
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,510
Give us a second, Jack.

229
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,120
It's totally random. I can't make any sense of it.

230
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,600
Maybe try a correlation matrix.

231
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,300
What's that going to do?

232
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,290
Just do it, Edgar.

233
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,700
I told you it wasn't going to work.

234
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,760
That's because you didn't expand the parameter.

235
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,700
See?

236
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,700
What have you got?

237
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,470
Two parallel columns,

238
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,620
but the data points are badly damaged.

239
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,710
What do you mean, parallel columns?

240
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,450
They could be a flight path.

241
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,550
I'll try plotting them over the USGS map.

242
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,380
It's working.

243
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,720
If that's a flight path, it's headed due west, over Nevada.

244
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,660
It's Los Angeles.

245
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,830
It's gotta be. It's coming towards Los Angeles.

246
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,490
Chloe, run a time analysis.

247
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,170
Assuming the missile travels at 600 miles per hour,

248
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,400
it puts it within this 30-mile segment.

249
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,750
I'll get those coordinates to the Air Force.

250
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,590
- Clark.  - Captain Clarke, Bill Buchanan, CTU.

251
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,400
The missile's heading for Los Angeles.

252
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,780
We've narrowed the possible coordinates.

253
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,990
- We're uploading them to you now.  - Squad's in the air, sir.

254
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,190
Okay, thanks.

255
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,460
They have planes ready in the air now.

256
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,670
If our projections are correct,

257
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,080
they should be able to find it quickly.

258
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,510
They'd better, since the casualty figures of an L.A. air strike

259
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,010
would be over a million lives lost,

260
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,200
including ours.

261
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,460
Put the military channel on speaker.

262
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,740
Delta One, I'm approaching the designated segment.

263
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,070
Roger that, Delta One.

264
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,610
Still no joy target. Searching.

265
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,750
Jack, if the missile gets shot down,

266
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,950
could the warhead detonate?

267
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,600
No, the warhead is specifically designed

268
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,320
not to blow up until it hits its designated target.

269
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,020
But the force of the impact could trigger the arming mechanism, right?

270
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,060
It's unlikely.

271
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,890
But it is possible, right, Jack?

272
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,750
Yes, it's possible, but we don't have a choice;

273
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,230
we're out of time here.

274
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,400
This is Air Control.

275
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,790
I've got a blip at 40.38 south by 30.16 west. Respond.

276
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,020
Closing in on those coordinates.

277
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,930
Possible contact. Breaking left.

278
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,560
Delta One, I've got tally on the target, 12:00.

279
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,490
Missile checks good. I'm armed.

280
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,950
Cleared to lock on target.

281
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,820
- Target acquired.  - Good lock. Repeat, good lock.

282
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,950
Delta 2 in range, sir. Request clearance to engage.

283
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,200
Delta 2, target is confirmed.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,030
I've got good tone. Fox two. Missile away.

285
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,040
Splash one.

286
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,700
That's a direct hit, Delta One. The target is down.

287
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,110
I repeat, the target is down.

288
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,130
Here's the report so far.

289
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,880
No nuclear radiation

290
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,800
was emitted when the missile was destroyed.

291
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,250
Debris hit the ground and, uh...

292
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,860
there was some damage and several injuries,

293
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,760
but no loss of life as far as we know.

294
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,390
We'll pick this up later.

295
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,000
When they told me you were dead...

296
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,270
It's all right. I'm sorry.

297
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,390
Oh, I love you.

298
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,050
I didn't realize how much until I thought I lost you.

299
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,100
What is it?

300
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,260
When that woman called and she told me...

301
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,540
Hey, listen... you did what you had to do.

302
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,050
But I didn't do what you did.

303
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,650
You chose me, and I chose...

304
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,020
Look, we did the best we could, all right?

305
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,610
Now it's over.

306
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,630
Did you get the information that I sent you?

307
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,630
No, commercial flights are still grounded. I'm...

308
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,600
I'm trying to get Paul back on a military transport.

309
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,580
Oh, please. Is there anything I can do for you?

310
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,180
Yeah, I haven't taken care of his funeral arrangements yet.

311
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,620
I still need to call his mother.

312
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,080
Listen, I... I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to get back to you.

313
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,160
There's something I need to deal with.

314
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,150
Your father said you're going to Washington tomorrow.

315
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,490
Yeah, I have to take care of Paul's funeral.

316
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,210
And after that?

317
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,550
I'm sorry, I...

318
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,840
I know this isn't the right time

319
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,090
to talk about everything.

320
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,270
Maybe tomorrow before you catch your flight,

321
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,730
we could, we could get together.

322
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,810
Jack, I don't think that's a good idea.

323
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,770
I thought we agreed that we...

324
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,520
wouldn't make those kinds of decisions today.

325
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,880
I know, but, just...

326
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,890
Audrey...

327
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,880
I love you.

328
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

329
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,920
That's all I want.

330
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,360
We both know that you belong here, Jack.

331
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,660
At CTU,

332
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,540
doing what you do best.

333
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,820
And thank God

334
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,920
there are people like you

335
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,640
who can deal with that world...

336
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,670
But I can't.

337
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,430
Please don't say that.

338
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,310
Oh, Jack.

339
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,370
Oh, Jack.

340
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,430
I love you.

341
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,940
But after today, it's just...

342
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,280
It won't work.

343
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,300
I'm sorry.

344
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,530
This is Bauer.

346
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,100
Jack, it's David Palmer.

347
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,150
Yes, Mr. President.

348
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,840
Words cannot express the debt this country owes you.

349
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,470
Thank you, sir.

350
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,370
Jack, this is hard for me,

351
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,910
but I don't seem to have a choice.

352
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,510
The Chinese have proof

353
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,670
that you led the assault on their consulate.

354
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,880
What kind of proof?

355
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,340
Howard Bern made a full confession.

356
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,730
He identified you as the agent in charge.

357
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,720
And now the Chinese want me.

358
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,330
That's right. And we have no choice but to comply.

359
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,700
I see.

360
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,010
But what they really want is for you to implicate the government.

361
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,010
Mr. President, that will never happen.

362
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,050
I know that.

363
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,930
They'll put you on trial,

364
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,790
propagandize about American arrogance...

365
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,120
then put you in prison.

366
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,250
I understand.

367
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,250
Jack, this is unfair, to say the least,

368
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,890
and I'm ashamed of my part in it.

369
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,440
But I promise you this:

370
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,740
I will make it my life's purpose to bring you back

371
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,990
to American soil as soon as humanly possible.

372
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,320
I know you'll do what you can, sir.

373
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,430
The Secret Service is sending over an agent to CTU.

374
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,790
He'll place you under house arrest,

375
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,710
but you'll have some time to put your affairs in order.

376
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,260
Jack, my friend, I wish there was something else I could say.

377
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,720
Mr. President, you're doing what has to be done.

378
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,170
So will I.

379
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,510
I know you will.

380
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,270
Thank you, Jack.

381
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,820
Thank you, sir.

382
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,340
This is a messy situation.

383
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,510
Even if Bauer doesn't implicate the President

384
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,130
in the attack on the consulate,

385
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,280
there are other problems.

386
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,010
Bauer is Special Advisor to the Secretary of Defense,

387
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,360
which makes him a high-value prisoner.

388
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,730
A gold mine of information.

389
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,140
The Chinese could squeeze him dry.

390
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,510
You're right.

391
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,890
Plus, the Chinese could share the information

392
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,360
with any intelligence agency in the world.

393
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,470
Eventually, what they get out of Bauer

394
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,270
could find its way into the hands of terrorists.

395
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,500
This could set us back years.

396
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,320
So the bottom line is...

397
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,620
I don't think you need me to spell that out for you.

398
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,360
I assume this isn't coming from President Logan.

399
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,740
Absolutely not.

400
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,080
He's expressly forbidden it.

401
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,780
But that doesn't mean he'd be sorry if it happened.

402
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,060
So any investigation into Bauer's death...

403
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,780
Will be brief and superficial.

404
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,400
I'll see to it personally.

405
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,500
Fine. I'll take care of it.

406
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,500
Good.

407
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,020
The President ordered Jack be extradited, not murdered.

408
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,820
Cummings wants Bauer dead so the Chinese can't question him.

409
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,750
President Logan shut him down.

410
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,970
We were both there.

411
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,290
It was a weak rebuke, at best.

412
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,820
This is still conjecture on your part,

413
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,440
based on one side of a conversation.

414
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,400
I know what I heard, and I know Cummings. You don't.

415
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,400
You really think he's capable of doing something like this?

416
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,940
He's been doing Logan's dirty work for the last 15 years.

417
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,090
Logan's gotten used to looking the other way.

418
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,530
I'd tell the President myself,

419
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,070
but he won't listen to me.

420
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:49,440
If you don't intervene now, it may be too late.

421
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,380
... and the Prime Minister is offering

422
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,300
to host a conference in London

423
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,460
for improving the flow of intelligence information among nations.

424
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,720
Tell him I accept his gracious offer.

425
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,410
Maybe you should tell him yourself, sir.

426
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,680
I think he wants to congratulate you personally

427
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,500
for steering the country so effectively

428
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,270
in its time of crisis.

429
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,310
Set up a call.

430
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,660
Yes, sir.

431
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,930
David.

432
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,560
I have been overwhelmed

433
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,320
by the outpouring of goodwill from heads of state

434
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,830
around the world.

435
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,460
Well-deserved, Mr. President.

436
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,310
You played a role, David.

437
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,930
You played a role.

438
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,830
Thank you, sir.

439
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,220
So what can I do for you?

440
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,810
Would you excuse us?

441
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,740
I'd like a moment alone with the President.

442
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,520
Sir, I have reason to believe

443
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,990
that your security chief may be preempting your decision

444
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,150
to hand Jack Bauer over to the Chinese.

445
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,310
Preempting me how?

446
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,630
By killing him before they can take custody.

447
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,220
Oh, for God's sake, David,

448
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,830
Cummings was just speaking hypothetically.

449
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,150
You can't take that at face value.

450
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,960
Besides which, I told him it wasn't an option.

451
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,540
All I'm asking you to do, sir,

452
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,550
is to talk to Cummings,

453
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,170
and make sure he understands your order.

454
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,470
David, I can't indulge some half-baked conspiracy...

455
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,850
I think I've earned the privilege

456
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,590
of having my concerns taken seriously.

457
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,450
You have.

458
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,740
But it's also no secret that your presidency

459
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,890
was infected with a certain level of paranoia

460
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,240
and scandal.

461
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,550
I won't allow that in my administration.

462
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,760
Questioning my security chief

463
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,430
would not only undermine his authority...

464
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,780
it would compromise mine, as well.

465
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,320
Hear no evil...

466
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,810
I beg your pardon?

467
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,910
You heard me.

468
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,790
David, thank you again for your assistance today,

469
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,650
but it's time for you to go back to civilian life

470
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,780
and let me do my job.

471
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,550
Hi, Jack.

472
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,050
Hey.

473
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,780
I just found out that Logan's going to make you take the fall

474
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,280
for everything that happened at the Chinese consulate.

475
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,780
No one's making me do anything.

476
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,080
The President didn't have a choice.

477
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,790
Yeah? Well, that doesn't make it fair, does it?

478
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,090
It is what it is.

479
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,830
This is Bauer.

480
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,290
Jack, are you still at CTU?

481
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,470
Yes, sir. Tony Almeida's just about to debrief me.

482
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,490
Listen to me very carefully.

483
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,720
Do not turn yourself in.

484
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,760
The man they sent to take you into custody

485
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,030
has orders to kill you.

486
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,210
Orders from who?

487
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,910
Someone in Logan's camp.

488
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,370
They think the Chinese will break you.

489
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,990
Logan authorize this?

490
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,880
Not directly, but he won't do anything to stop it.

491
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,180
Now, listen to me.

492
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,150
Get out of there now.

493
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,230
Thank you, sir.

494
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,300
Bill Buchanan, Regional Director of Division, Los Angeles.

495
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,070
Dale Spaulding, Secret Service.

496
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,260
You'll have to sign this before I take Bauer.

497
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,210
What is it?

498
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,170
Chain of custody authorization.

499
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,210
I'm not signing anything until Bauer's been debriefed.

500
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,340
When that happens, he's all yours.

501
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,000
Fair enough.

502
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,190
We'd be burying a million Americans right now

503
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,530
if it wasn't for Jack Bauer.

504
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,420
He's a hero.

505
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,800
I'm sure he is.

506
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,950
I'm just following orders.

507
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,610
I want him treated with the respect he deserves.

508
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,060
Of course.

509
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,180
Tony's on line one. He says it's urgent.

510
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,810
Something to do with Jack.

511
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,400
Buchanan.

512
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,600
Bill, it's Tony.

513
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,010
Jack escaped.

514
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,940
Escaped?

515
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,510
He took me by surprise. There was nothing I could do.

516
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,230
Damn it.

517
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,190
Look, he's still inside the building,

518
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,770
somewhere in Section C.

519
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,530
I'm the one who ordered the lockdown.

520
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,530
I'll be right there.

521
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,830
All right.

522
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,800
Bauer's trying to get away.

523
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,880
Jack disabled the surveillance feed a minute ago.

524
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,710
Were you able to make visual contact before that?

525
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,270
Yes, he's still in Section C.

526
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,090
Jack was willing to turn himself over to the Chinese.

527
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,530
What happened?

528
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,740
I can't say for sure,

529
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,990
but he did get a phone call.

530
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,860
Who from?

531
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,360
I don't know. I was waiting for him to finish up.

532
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,210
Next thing I know, I'm on the ground.

533
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,160
He cold-cocked me.

534
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,770
- Does Bauer have a weapon?  - Yeah.

535
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,440
How many entrances and exits?

536
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,750
Four. They're all blocked off.

537
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,000
He'll try to punch through 'em.

538
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,250
Yeah, but I have two guards posted at each point.

539
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,790
I'm not taking any chances.

540
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,260
- What are you doing?  - Going after him.

541
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,060
Wait a second.

542
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,180
I've got orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.

543
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,250
I intend to execute those orders.

544
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,740
This building is my jurisdiction.

545
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,270
You lost jurisdiction when you lost Bauer.

546
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,060
If you want me to stand down, call the President.

547
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,840
Otherwise, stay out of my way.

548
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,830
But I'm going with you.

549
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,620
No, you're not. I'm doing this alone.

550
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,510
Either you take Tony,

551
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,820
or you're not going in.

552
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,630
Follow me.

553
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,330
Jack, it's Tony. Are you in here?

554
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,170
Come on, let's talk! There's got to be a way out of this!

555
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,580
Jack, give it up!

556
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,330
Stay out of my way.

557
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,610
This is over!

558
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,980
I'm going to go bring Jack out.

559
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,480
You want to stop me, you can shoot me in the back.

560
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,870
Jack, I'm putting my weapon down.

561
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,210
I'm coming in.

562
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,100
Jack?

563
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,680
Jack!

564
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,610
He's dead.

565
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,630
You killed him.

566
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,880
- He was shooting at us.  - He was aiming wide.

567
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,170
He was laying down cover fire.

568
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,090
If he wanted to hit us, he'd have hit us.

569
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,480
Oh, my God, Jack.

570
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,660
You killed him, you son of a bitch! You killed him!

571
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,380
Get him out of here! Take him to the Situation Room.

572
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,770
I'm sorry.

573
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,310
God, Jack.

574
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,200
Give me the epinephrine.

575
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,250
I hope it's not too late.

576
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,490
He really looks dead.

577
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
That was the idea, Chloe.

578
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,570
How fast is it supposed to take effect?

579
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,350
Come on, Jack!

580
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,250
Damn!

581
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,160
Tony...

582
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,290
Come on, Jack! Damn it!

583
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,670
Can you hear me?

584
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,220
You know where you are?

585
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,440
Yeah.

586
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,580
All right, Chloe,

587
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,090
I need you to run interference with the local coroner

588
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,510
until we can switch bodies.

589
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,840
Make sure their database synchs up with Jack's information.

590
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,030
That won't cover the autopsy.

591
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,870
There's not going to be an autopsy.

592
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,890
They wanted Jack dead. Now he's dead.

593
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,470
Bill...

594
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,670
I just talked to my father.

595
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,080
He said that Jack was being handed over

596
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,630
to the Chinese government?

597
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,890
He was supposed to be...

598
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,050
but he tried to escape.

599
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,450
I don't understand.

600
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,700
Neither do I.

601
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,770
No.

602
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,730
Audrey...

603
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,690
No, don't say it.

604
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,730
No.

605
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,350
I'm sorry.

606
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,240
All right, we're clear.

607
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,410
You sure you're okay, Jack?

608
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,130
Yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,810
You both need to get back to CTU

610
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,160
before anyone gets suspicious.

611
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,350
Tony, you can drop me off anywhere up there.

612
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,950
All right.

613
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,020
We've secured your new identity.

614
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,450
It should help you get across the border.

615
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,690
Okay.

616
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,960
Did you get me a clean phone?

617
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,150
Yeah. Here's a scramble filter.

618
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,310
You can talk up to one minute undetected.

619
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,280
I can't thank you both enough for everything.

620
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,740
You got to get going.

621
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,110
Jack...

622
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,860
Be careful.

623
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,810
Yeah.

624
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,560
You, too.

625
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,960
Thank you both for everything.

626
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,720
Palmer.

627
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,180
Mr. President, this is Jack Bauer.

628
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,260
You threaded the eye of the needle.

629
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,680
I had some help, sir.

630
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,440
I wanted to thank you

631
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,580
for advising me of the situation.

632
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,300
Mr. President, you saved my life.

633
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,310
I'm only sorry it came to this.

634
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,860
Me, too, sir.

635
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,460
I just wanted to let you know that I was out.

636
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,220
I'm glad.

637
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,280
This is probably the last time we'll ever speak.

638
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,850
Jack, you do understand, when you hang up,

639
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:37,010
for all intents and purposes, Jack Bauer's dead.

640
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,950
I understand that, sir.

641
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,200
Mr. President, it's been an honor.

642
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,860
Same for me, my friend.

643
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


644
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
