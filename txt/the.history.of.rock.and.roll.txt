1
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,719
In the '80s, rock had irony, flash...

2
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,812
and more sex appeal than ever.

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,119
By beaming rock videos
around the world...

4
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,422
MTVbecame
music's first global network...

5
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,019
and created
a powerful new corporate medium...

6
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,794
complete with wild imagery
and calculated self-censorship.

7
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,836
At the same time,
inner-city youth were improvising...

8
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,396
a controversial medium of their own
in the form of rap.

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,205
By the '90s, the scene had come full circle
with alternative rock.

10
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,770
The new wave
would become a big business...

11
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,942
but only by climbing up
from the underground.

12
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,248
Ladies and gentlemen, rock 'n'roll.

13
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,832
You'll never look at music
the same way again.

14
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,733
When MTV started, we were naive,
idealistic, and hopeful.

15
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,433
We thought, "This is it. Everything
Devo'd thought and been talking about...

16
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,373
"what we'd wanted to happen
is happening."

17
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,209
We want to create this thing called MTV,
a new attitude.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,215
We were going to be
the first TV network ever...

19
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:01,583
to sell the network identity
as opposed to selling its programs.

20
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,688
Television used to be called
a vast wasteland.

21
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,059
That was before Music Television, MTV.

22
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,495
MTV felt very revolutionary then.

23
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,728
MTV was very much in everybody's face,
and there wasn't much on it.

24
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,535
We'd be in an airport...

25
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:25,169
and people were coming up
to all of us and going:

26
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,736
"Hey, where's your top hat?"

27
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,715
Or, "Where's your motorcycle?"

28
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,143
"What are you talking about?"

29
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,948
"We saw you on MTV."

30
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,818
And this became the thing...

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,984
that changed MTV's relationship
with the music business.

32
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,426
When the artists started hearing
everybody say, "I saw you on MTV..."

33
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,487
they started saying,
"Saw me doing what?"

34
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,465
"I saw the video
where you were doing this."

35
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,126
They thought, "I never saw that."

36
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,467
For months, we were going,
"We gotta see this MTV."

37
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,075
And the groups then got involved
in the creative process.

38
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,081
We went to Warner Bros. and said,
"We're gonna do a video to Whip lt. "

39
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,846
They said, "Why? The song's already
charting. What do you need a video for?"

40
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,151
And we said,
"We just think we should do one.

41
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:14,091
"We want to have this girl,
and Mark's gonna whip her clothes off. "

42
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,258
Of course, they said, "Absolutely not. "

43
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,356
So we did it anyway with our own money.

44
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,901
This was the image of men and women...

45
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,635
as corporate advertising
likes to portray them.

46
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,078
Your all-American,
Budweiser kind of guys and girls...

47
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,275
the good-looking jocks and jockesses.

48
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,744
We were to appear on the Lily Tomlin
special the week this was finished.

49
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,249
She said,
"Do you have a video for this song?"

50
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,878
We proudly said, "Yes, we do."
We sent it, and she canceled us.

51
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,953
We thought people would see the irony
and sense of humor.

52
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,928
I thought it was pretty obvious
we were doing satire.

53
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,892
In those times, it seemed fun to do videos.

54
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,800
There weren't too many of them,
and it was fun to see yourself on TV.

55
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,709
The first video we made,
Our Lips are Sealed, in the car...

56
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,745
we thought, "What is a video?"

57
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,551
We just didn't take it seriously at all.

58
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,250
We went driving around the city
and jumping in fountains and things.

59
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,759
We thought it was ridiculous
that we were doing it.

60
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:59,025
Little did we know that, that medium
became such an important part of music.

61
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,698
At the end of '81 is when
we started touring with The Police.

62
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:14,304
We opened for them, and that's really
what blew the lid off of it...

63
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,941
when our record went to number one
and theirs was still at number six.

64
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,713
-Sorry, but, you know....
-The opening band.

65
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,545
In those days, it was very different.

66
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,258
You could make an album, two albums.

67
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,419
The record company
would still be behind you.

68
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,429
It wasn't such a fast turnover as it is now.

69
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,663
There was much more....

70
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,531
The record company
believed in development then.

71
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,233
It wasn't about, "If you have two singles
and don't get your video on MTV...

72
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,366
"then you're finished."

73
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:51,015
At first, the general consensus
was that I would never be a pop star.

74
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,451
They wanted to release Do You Really
Want to Hurt Me. I was against it.

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,921
"This shouldn't come out as a single.
This will be the end of us. "

76
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,617
And I was wrong.

77
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,970
Do You Really Want to Hurt Me
was something sincere...

78
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,573
that I'd written from a real-life experience.

79
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,051
It had black and white minstrels in it,
and black guys painted black.

80
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,648
For some reason,
MTV decided that they couldn't show that.

81
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,795
MTV in the early years was bullshit.

82
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,697
I didn't understand it, never watched it,
didn't care about it.

83
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,851
So, we have Kurtis Blow with The Breaks.

84
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:09,126
We have Melle Mel and
Grandmaster Flash with The Message.

85
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,963
And they couldn't get arrested on TV.

86
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,202
Rap not only had a problem
with television...

87
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,296
it had a problem with radio
and black radio.

88
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,307
Here you have a community...

89
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,877
that had nothing
to represent themselves. Nothing.

90
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,339
Everything was somebody else's
expression of reality and society.

91
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,451
So we were forced to take that,
mutilate it...

92
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,251
and give it back as our expression now.

93
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,824
At that time,
breakdancing was a real big thing then.

94
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,658
This is where you would have two males,
or two females...

95
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,756
or a male and female
compete against each other.

96
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,438
Graffiti was a thing for all the artists.

97
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,780
Graffiti is not an art...

98
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,115
but I can sure as hell tell you that
that's a crime.

99
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,555
You could just jump the fence.
It was like a schoolyard fence.

100
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,219
You could go into the yards
and put your name up...

101
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,822
then wait for the train to go by,
and that was your finale for the day.

102
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,830
"Wow! My name is traveling
all through New York city."

103
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,935
Hip-hop is the umbrella.

104
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,533
Hip-hop is the way you move your body.

105
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,545
It's the way you talk, the way you think,
the sensibility.

106
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,240
It's the way you....

107
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:41,676
Whether it's graffiti, popping and locking,
breakdancing, and everything else...

108
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,952
it's the sensibility.
And it's one of the richest sensibilities...

109
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,892
that's come along in a long, long time.

110
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,828
You had your solo rappers,
Kurtis Blow and Melle Mel.

111
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,959
But then you had the Furious Five,
Treacherous Three, Double Trouble.

112
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,061
So this is how two MCs would do it
at the same time.

113
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,303
But the first guy on a B-Boy rapping tip....

114
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,241
What I mean by "B-Boy,"
you know, over breakbeats with a DJ...

115
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,572
and cutting it up.

116
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,705
The first guy that fascinated me
was Melle Mel, because he was clear...

117
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:49,318
he had a good voice,
and he rhymed on beat.

118
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:53,584
And his DJ was fascinating.
DJ Flash was incredible.

119
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,820
I had come up with...

120
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:00,296
a mixing technique
which I called the Quick Mix Theory...

121
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,096
where I was able to take
two copies of the same record...

122
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,763
on two different turntables...

123
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:11,041
and repeat the climactic part of the record
over and over again.

124
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15,981
And this was around 1979,
where I kind of saw this guy do it.

125
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,916
I said, "This guy's got it right.
This guy's doing it right. "

126
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,184
When we heard a rough draft
ofThe Message...

127
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,155
the lyrics were quite dark.

128
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,238
We felt, "Why would the world
want to hear something like this?"

129
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,415
It was like an explosion.
You would hear it on BLS.

130
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,954
You turned the dial two notches,
you'd hear it again.

131
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,185
Turn the dial to the left, four notches.
You'd hear it again.

132
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,691
It was all over the place.

133
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,772
I was shaken up, a little scared.

134
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,713
I grew up listening to my influences...

135
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,411
like your James Browns,
your Sly and the Family Stones.

136
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,648
But to hear my own record like that,
it was....

137
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,155
I want my MTV!

138
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,587
We were playing probably about the same
percentage black videos as white videos.

139
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,997
The same number of black artists
as white artists had produced videos.

140
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,132
Sorry, MTV, but I got to tell people this.

141
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,431
I'm in New York. It's 1981 .
I get a phone call.

142
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,632
"Don Letts, we want to interview you.

143
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,907
"You're the man
who makes the Clash videos." Fine.

144
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,514
I go to MTV. I show up in the offices.

145
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,948
Everyone's looking at me funny...

146
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,445
like I should have used
the tradesmen's entrance or something.

147
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,548
Somebody comes down, calls me
into an office, sits me down, and says:

148
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,117
"Don, you have to understand...

149
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,323
"that we have a little problem here."

150
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,889
What he was saying
is he didn't realize I was black.

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,662
He went on to tell me that, at that time...

152
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,500
the policy of MTV...

153
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,700
was to cater to a Midwest white audience.

154
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,943
Therefore, they weren't really
playing black videos.

155
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,774
He even gave me an example
of how strict this rule was.

156
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,908
He cited Wordy Rappinghood...

157
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,215
which was a cartoon
with animation video.

158
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,313
But he said, "That sounds too black,
so we don't play that."

159
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,789
We could not get Billie Jean on MTV.

160
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:47,932
CBS threatened to pull their roster
unless MTV started to play black artists.

161
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,365
I think the story that went around
was Walter Yetnikoff...

162
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,166
who was the legendary sort of...

163
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,402
pound-the-tables head of CBS Records....

164
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,702
I think what happened was
Walter told Michael...

165
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,542
that MTV didn't want to play that video.

166
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,176
"I went and told them, 'You play
this video, or I'll burn you down."'

167
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,551
With the big threats,
and made himself look good to Michael.

168
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,421
When they started playing
Michael Jackson's video...

169
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,392
they considered that a great achievement.
But if you're black...

170
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,224
you remember Michael Jackson from 1969.

171
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,957
So maybe it was a big turnaround
for white America...

172
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:58,993
but for black America, and for myself,
I wasn't thrilled.

173
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,922
That was the beginning
of music television, I think.

174
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,595
And it was Michael Jackson,
Thriller, on MTV.

175
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,605
MTV and Michael rode each other to glory.

176
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,482
This is a rock 'n' roll museum.

177
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,482
You guys don't belong in here.

178
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,854
Somebody had to take the banner
to the next level.

179
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:57,462
And it had to be a group
that was willing to do something...

180
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,795
that would be a milestone,
not just another record.

181
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,562
When I saw Run-D.M.C...

182
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,002
I said, "This is how
it's supposed to be done."

183
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,801
Those boys are def! They are def!

184
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,511
We put the record out, Sucker MCs.
We did a lot of praying.

185
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,482
When we put this record out, Sucker MCs,
nobody had a rap album out.

186
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,018
We just wanted our record to play...

187
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,055
like some of the records
on the big radio station.

188
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:28,116
MTV came along as everything
was rolling right into place for us.

189
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,683
Everything was falling into place.

190
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,492
We couldn't stop it
from falling into place after a while.

191
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,294
Then MTV, we got a call from Russell.

192
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,165
Something called MTV added us,
it's really big to them.

193
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,762
"What's MTV?" Gather that together.

194
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,034
-We didn't know MTV.
-Didn't have cable in Hollis.

195
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,167
But they're very excited at the office...

196
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,372
that we're gonna get regular rotation
with Rock Box on MTV.

197
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,177
"You don't understand how big this is. "
"Okay, I'll tell D.

198
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,811
"D., we got added on something called
MTV. They're very excited about this.

199
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,286
"This is a big breakthrough. "

200
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,188
So we saw that they're happy,
so it must be something big.

201
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,657
Raising Hell was big.

202
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,394
Everybody wanted to wear the black Levis
and the black sweatshirt.

203
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,698
Everybody else thinks,
besides rock 'n' roll...

204
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,243
"Okay, it's time to go on stage.
Give me my wardrobe.

205
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,802
"I need my sparkles.
I gotta look good for the people."

206
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,316
When people actually
just want to see you in your jeans.

207
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,715
They want to relate with you.

208
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,618
Bruce Springsteen wears his jeans,
and you go out on stage.

209
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,715
Walk around all day. It's time to go
on stage. Keep walking up to the stage.

210
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,420
That's what they wanna see,
so that's what we did.

211
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,861
We brought
what we was in the alley rapping.

212
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,761
Time to do the show. "Turn the camera on.

213
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,198
"Let's do the same thing
we were doing in the alley. "

214
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,631
They said, "That's real, what I want. "
We did what we were doing.

215
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,200
We took the beat from the street
and put it on the TV.

216
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,110
Run-D.M.C., Raising Hell. 1986.

217
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,947
I remember I was in a record store,
staring at this record.

218
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,813
I couldn't believe it.

219
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,916
I'd known the guys for three years,
but I kept flipping it around.

220
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,622
I stayed in the store for an hour.
I said, "This is how rap's supposed to....

221
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,290
"Rap is really bigtime.
This is how it's supposed to be."

222
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,696
We were getting ready
to make a rap record...

223
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,566
over the beat Walk This Way.

224
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,766
Before rap records were made,
we would rap over Toys in the Attic.

225
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,641
I was getting ready to rap over
the first three seconds of the record.

226
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,214
With them loud guitars coming, I'm mad.

227
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,409
I'd lose 10 seconds
at the start of the record.

228
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,715
If it ever got to him singing,
there's a problem, I'm mad at the DJ.

229
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,051
Rick Rubin walked in and just took over.

230
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,024
"Let's really make the record over.
Let's call these guys. "

231
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,688
Which weren't doing well at the time,
"Let's make Walk This Way over. "

232
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,781
Joe and I flew in,
and there were these three guys...

233
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,617
doing this thing called rap,
which was relatively brand-new.

234
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,132
Rick said, "Just kind of play along
and get a bass. "

235
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:35,196
So I played bass on it,
and it kind of built this track up.

236
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,866
They came in and rapped it.

237
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:40,935
They rapped whatever words
they thought they were, which was cool.

238
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,125
He was mad at it for a while.

239
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,500
He was mad at the fact that,
"Oh, my God, the rap.... "

240
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,265
Everybody was like,
"Run-D.M.C. made y'all rap. "

241
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,138
For a while, they were a little hurt by it.

242
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,718
Everyone was saying that rap is just a fad.

243
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,616
As a matter of fact, hip-hop,
the whole thing, is a fad...

244
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,987
and it's gonna die soon.

245
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,652
People were saying,
no way was rap gonna work.

246
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,959
Even though I didn't like it much at first,
I knew then that it was gonna work.

247
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:37,127
A lot of r&b artists back in the days
used to say all kind of things.

248
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,535
"It's not music."
Rock-'n'-roll artists, as well.

249
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,905
I don't think it's the highest form
of music that you can make...

250
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,069
because you're using
someone else's melody.

251
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,238
I just took offense to that.
I said, "No, it's more than that."

252
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:54,115
They still say things like,
"It's not music. It's garbage."

253
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,744
Rap's short for "crap."

254
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,311
Rap was computerized rot.

255
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,222
"If Hitler was to make a song,
it would be rap."

256
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:10,225
I first designed Public Enemy
in the footsteps of Run-D.M.C...

257
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,796
who I think, and still think,
are the best rap group ever in rap music.

258
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,273
So I designed my group after them,
and I said:

259
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,072
"After studying Run-D.M.C.,
I can't go wrong."

260
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,731
We recorded Criminal Minded.

261
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,407
That album was all about
introducing the new style.

262
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,574
That's all it was about, the new style.

263
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,172
We are taking over the new style.

264
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,843
We came with a different ball game...

265
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,917
of consciousness, self-knowledge....

266
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,617
But also, on a musical end,
we came with a faster tempo.

267
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,521
The biggest difference in It Takes a Nation
of Millions to Hold Us Back...

268
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,224
is that the beat range
of a lot of rap records...

269
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,699
were 98, 96 beats per minute.

270
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,135
And here I come with hip-hop, reggae...

271
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,733
and 16-bar rhyme styles....

272
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,974
Like, that's it, that's all, solo, single,
no more, no less.

273
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,382
And at a time when people was going,
"He's this, I'm that."

274
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,886
"Throw your hands in the air, just clap."

275
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:20,861
And our stuff was more like
109 beats per minute.

276
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,306
The kids was just going crazy
for this style.

277
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,473
All right, all right!

278
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,706
-Who the hell are you?
-We're the band.

279
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,585
The band? Where's your instruments?

280
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,719
What the....

281
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,588
We only play rock music here!

282
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,387
Yo, why you dissing, man?

283
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,160
-Rock 'n' roll!
-Yeah, dude. Like, I think we're the band.

284
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,815
The first white rap that got across to me...

285
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,581
was the Beastie Boys, because they came
from the same environment.

286
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:23,386
Them guys, they were some bugged-out...

287
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,058
gentlemen.

288
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:40,337
The Beastie Boys outraged audiences
as the opening act for Madonna...

289
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,437
on her 1985 Virgin tour.

290
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,677
In 1990, she outraged executives at MTV...

291
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,413
who banned her Justify My Love video.

292
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,776
There are all sorts of artists...

293
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,310
who are using music
in a not-so-central way.

294
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,880
Something else is the center
of what they're doing.

295
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,359
For example,
the highly controversial Madonna.

296
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,458
People don't like her...

297
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,728
because she seems to use music
as part of the package for herself.

298
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,401
I say, "Why not?"

299
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:15,303
If that's what she wants to do, why does
music have to be the center of it?

300
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:19,776
Why can't lifestyle be the center,
and music be part of the presentation?

301
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,980
I like Madonna.

302
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:36,020
But, for me, she went a little overboard...

303
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,159
for me, my limit.

304
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:42,131
I felt like, after a while,
she just wanted to shock people.

305
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,094
That's all she was interested in,
shocking people.

306
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,706
All the people that have stood out,
stood the test of time...

307
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,677
are people that have had
more than just their music.

308
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,587
When video came about
and we saw the groups making videos...

309
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:09,116
that were basically them bouncing around,
we decided not to do anything like that.

310
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:28,170
The English have this uncanny knack
of packaging...

311
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,072
giving something a look, a style...

312
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,584
and making it into more than just a sound.

313
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,815
I think much more so than the Americans.

314
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,620
So I wrote the actual script
for the video ofSweet Dreams...

315
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,958
as a kind of surrealistic, short,
three-and-a-half minute film...

316
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,261
largely influenced
by Salvador Dali's L'age d'or.

317
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,834
And the idea of a cow...

318
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,962
coming and disturbing the reality
of a boardroom meeting...

319
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,941
or vice versa, a boardroom meeting
being in the middle of a field of cows...

320
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,343
to show the actual sort of uselessness
and the stupidity...

321
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:06,714
of people making decisions
that think they're altering the world.

322
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,179
But in America,
we speeded up a whole process.

323
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:44,017
We didn't go there
and tour for years and years...

324
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,114
'cause MTV kind of did it for us.

325
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,426
I think it sped up the process.

326
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,925
It didn't replace road work.

327
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,488
At the time,
I remember discussions with my buddies:

328
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,127
"We don't have to tour anymore.
We'll just make a video."

329
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,000
It certainly helps...

330
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,337
to have your video
played 20 times a day on TV.

331
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,447
The trouble with being a visual artist...

332
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,494
is that the visual aspects of one's art...

333
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,499
generally leave their marks
more graphically...

334
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,034
than the more musical form
of what you do.

335
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,935
I originally disliked MTV quite a lot...

336
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,446
because I thought it was a real safe play...

337
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,151
and I still think it does play safe
in many ways.

338
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:54,214
But I think that it's undeniably created
a forum...

339
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,090
for some of the most interesting film
and video work...

340
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,460
that's been done in the last 10 years.

341
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,005
It's like a lot of things today
are forced on you...

342
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,372
in your ears, in your eyes...

343
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,843
whether you walk down the street
with neon signs...

344
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,905
music blaring in lifts, in restaurants.

345
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,850
A lot of the time, MTV can be like that.
It's just like wallpaper blaring at you.

346
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,151
But every now and then,
there's a great filmmaker or great group...

347
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,249
that has a great thing on,
and it's worth it for that.

348
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,425
Video is the worst thing
that ever happened to music.

349
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,129
It's taken a lot of magic out of music.

350
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:42,002
What the video age
and MTVhas killed off...

351
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:46,669
is this whole thing about how now a song
is this visual.

352
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,678
The great thing, in the early days...

353
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,442
was you could just sit there
and hear these songs...

354
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,451
and make up your own images
and find your own things in it...

355
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,248
and let your mind wander.

356
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,767
And artists that are
not particularly over-talented...

357
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,101
but because they look the part,
become stars.

358
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,573
Fortunately,
we came in before that started.

359
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,736
Would you get someone like me now...

360
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:24,213
that doesn't look like a million dollars?
No. I don't think you would.

361
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:42,257
If they're on television all the time,
you've taken some of the thrill of it out.

362
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,501
When I was a kid and David Bowie
was playing at Lewisham Odeon...

363
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,038
it was a big thing.
It was six months of waiting...

364
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,506
and it was exciting.
Now you just turn on your TV.

365
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,736
It's like, "David Bowie. Yeah. KISS."

366
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,213
I've seen things on MTV
that have just made my eyes go like this.

367
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,012
They're shockingly original
and fabulous things.

368
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,652
Some of the best video makers now...

369
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,624
can do things in a four-minute pop video...

370
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,753
that they would never, ever be able to do
in any other forum.

371
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:15,595
I'm thinking, for instance,
of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

372
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,594
Rock 'n'roll is sexuality personified.
It's attitudes.

373
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:57,129
It's all the things your parents told you
don't do, you can do.

374
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:01,167
It's the freedom to express yourself.
It's a good time. It's being alive.

375
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,046
It expresses the times.

376
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:08,779
It's a way of.... It's a magazine, newspaper
that's the truth.

377
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,983
If you listen to rap today,
it's all about the truth...

378
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,423
which is all we all want,
just give me a little bit of truth.

379
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,552
Middle America might be saying,
"Not in my backyard."

380
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,128
They would never see
what was going on if it was up to them.

381
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,191
Out of sight, out of mind,
seems like their credo.

382
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:29,368
As Americans across the country began to
accept rap as a reputable form of music...

383
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,410
Gangsta rap.

384
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,371
This is what this guy,
this child has seen all of his life...

385
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,044
but when you put a beat to it
and put some rhythm...

386
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,850
you say you don't want to hear it.

387
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:50,193
You understand me? But he's only
telling you what he was raised around.

388
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,786
This is what is in his environment...

389
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,358
and he's expressing it the only way
he or she knows how to express it.

390
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,757
Well, you know, N.W.A.,
Niggers With Attitudes...

391
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,384
when I heard their first album...

392
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,725
Straight Outta Compton,
I thought it was brilliant.

393
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,756
They said things outwardly...

394
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,701
on tape, on a record,
that people would only think.

395
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,143
Some things that you say and do...

396
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,237
go a long way
to influence those that listen.

397
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:48,477
And unfortunately, I feel,
my opinion only...

398
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,116
that it has only resulted in
a lot of negativity...

399
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,714
within the black community.

400
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,959
It's not negativity. It's niggativity.

401
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,090
It's niggative.

402
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,562
And they represented it
for the West Coast.

403
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:06,330
They actually single-handedly
put the West Coast on the map.

404
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,905
Ice-T was doing it.

405
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,635
Ice-T was the forerunner.
He was like John the Baptist.

406
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,438
I created the crime line.

407
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,947
I was the first person to really rap
about crime.

408
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,882
More than the attitude in "gangsta rap... "

409
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,022
it's become a thing where a lot of the guys
from the West Coast...

410
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,081
where what's going on
in the neighborhood...

411
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,787
is blended with
that particular type of music.

412
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,521
In sales...

413
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:05,585
these guys go Platinum and Gold...

414
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,856
like we breathe.

415
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,731
Rap is going
in so many different directions now.

416
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,360
It's a versatile music.

417
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,304
A lot of white kids are learning
a lot about black people...

418
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:20,504
because of hip-hop, you know?
We all get to learn about each other.

419
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,069
Hip-hop is like the CNN for the youth.

420
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,082
You don't start a band to save the world,
you really don't.

421
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,554
You start a band for all the wrong reasons.

422
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:36,054
Just to make a big noise.

423
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,095
And roar at the world.
That's where it starts.

424
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:46,264
And later on in life,
you develop a conscience.

425
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,467
When you begin to get real popular...

426
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,566
you have to be careful
that obviously there's not a dilution...

427
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:56,046
into some very simplistic terms
of what you're doing.

428
00:36:56,147 --> 00:37:00,413
America's future rests
in a thousand dreams inside your hearts.

429
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:05,718
It rests in the message of hope in songs of
a man so many young Americans admire:

430
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,355
New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen.

431
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,260
Tonight in this city,
there's people going hungry.

432
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,562
There's old folks whose social security
checks don't get them through the month.

433
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,068
There's people
who've been hit by unemployment.

434
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:23,436
People who the trickle-down theory
of economics ain't trickling down to.

435
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:27,967
At the time, part of the idea was
that I wanted the band to come out to be...

436
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,912
a bit of an alternative voice...

437
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,847
to the image of America...

438
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,614
that was being presented
by our Reagan administration.

439
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,675
In a way, the communication
has affected so many things.

440
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:18,215
In music, and even the Berlin Wall,
and perestroika and glasnost.

441
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,550
It's been very powerful,
and people see what's going on.

442
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:26,460
The information between videos and films
and music and everything else...

443
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,158
when people absorb this,
how powerful it is...

444
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,758
the changes, it pulls the walls down.

445
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,766
And it wasn't Interpol or the CIA
or anything else...

446
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,636
that turned all this stuff around.

447
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,700
It was music, video, films,
and information.

448
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,626
I think rock 'n'roll is very powerful.

449
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:04,134
It's a tool
for bettering the world these days.

450
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,126
The conveyances
that give us rock 'n' roll...

451
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:11,140
are contributing more
to the change in society than rock itself.

452
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:15,438
MTV, for instance, a channel
which conveys rock 'n' roll to us...

453
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,581
actually instigated a whole method
of trying to involve youth...

454
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,481
with changing politics and voting.

455
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,545
What's up? It's real popular in rap
right now to diss the establishment...

456
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,719
or complain
about the establishment's faults.

457
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,925
What needs to be popular
is getting y'all out there to vote.

458
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:33,986
Know what I'm saying?

459
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,731
Trying to change the world
with rock 'n' roll...

460
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:46,934
is kind of a funny thought.
I don't think you can.

461
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,707
I don't think it has any power
to change the world.

462
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,615
It only reconfirms or reaffirms to people
where they're at.

463
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,114
One nice thing it does is brings people...

464
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,850
that feel disenfranchised and lonely,
together.

465
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,721
The whole idea that we could change
the world musically...

466
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,395
with good thoughts, positive energy,
good vibrations...

467
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,401
we could write songs that would make
people love, not hate each other...

468
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,565
we could put an end to war and violence
by just positive thinking...

469
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,907
was really a wonderfully innocent idea.

470
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,972
It didn't quite work,
but it was a great idea.

471
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,981
To change the world,
you must get out there and change it.

472
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:28,177
Music won't change it. Music changes
the way you live in the world.

473
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,585
It changes the way you see it,
but it doesn't change the world itself.

474
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,359
I just remember Salt and myself
in a studio at the time...

475
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,520
and we were watching the news...

476
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,958
"I'm HIV-positive. "

477
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:21,232
And we just sat there, fell,
like, "Oh, my God! "

478
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:25,969
And it just hit us. And from that day on,
it was like, "Oh, my God...."

479
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,102
You know what I mean? A lot of people....

480
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:32,478
That's home to us. That's, like, close.
That's the circle we hang in. That's young.

481
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,430
We need women to pick up women now,
especially with all the....

482
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,028
You know, how the guys diss the women...

483
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,370
gangsta calling women hos and bitches
and things like that.

484
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:01,434
We kind of counteract that
with the things that we say.

485
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:04,771
Even political songs become pop songs
after they're old.

486
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,643
It seems to be that self-consciousness...

487
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,583
is what suffocates...

488
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:15,219
the kind of creative spirit in anything...

489
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,089
but especially in rock 'n' roll.

490
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,056
Look what you've done to me.

491
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:26,959
You've made me very famous,
and I thank you.

492
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:38,107
I know you like your pop stars
to be exciting...

493
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,447
so I wore these.

494
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:48,987
Between stadiums, excessive indulgence...

495
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:53,359
the growth of the media, the audiences,
and record sales...

496
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:57,064
rock 'n' roll became big business.

497
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:47,006
I think U2's popularity
is founded on several things, actually.

498
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,075
One is that they write great songs.

499
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:52,589
Two is that they work extremely well
as a band.

500
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,851
But I think most importantly...

501
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,621
people sense
that their commitment is real.

502
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:38,529
Not many things travel well
around the world because of language.

503
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,331
The one thing that travels well
is rock 'n'roll.

504
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,600
I remember in the Himalayas...

505
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:47,906
up at Namche Bazaar,
which is the last element of civilization...

506
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:52,210
before you enter into
Everest base camp area, Khumbu valley...

507
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:56,685
it's up around 16,000 feet.
It is the highest point of any civilization.

508
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,554
This was the model
for Shangri-La, that old, ancient movie.

509
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:04,788
I remember walking into
a little box-room, like a warehouse area...

510
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:08,161
where they stored rice and grain,
there was a picture of Duran Duran.

511
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,361
In the last six years,
I've been in 35 countries...

512
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,301
many of them over and over again...

513
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,635
on every single continent,
in the name of rap.

514
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,766
People say, "Do they like rap in China?"

515
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,935
I say, "What do you think
I've been there for?"

516
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,139
Like I went over there to play ping-pong,
or some shit.

517
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,948
People thought it would probably
spread east to the East Coast...

518
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,043
maybe somewhere down south.

519
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,783
Did I think it was going to
go to Australia, Africa...

520
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,892
England, and Paris?

521
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,491
I don't think so.

522
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,257
Hip-hop started here, you know,
in one place...

523
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:45,063
and it's all over the world now.
You got Japanese MCs...

524
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,764
and all peoples from all nationalities,
rhyming on the mike.

525
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,969
I've been to India
and seen an Indian rap group...

526
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,044
rapping about things happening
in that village.

527
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,707
There are cultures in the world
that are disappearing.

528
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:02,013
To some people, it's very important
that they be preserved.

529
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:05,885
How does that fit in with a system...

530
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,454
where in every country of the world now...

531
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:11,016
people want to watch MTV
and play rock 'n' roll?

532
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:14,723
How are the young people gonna realize
the value of their own music?

533
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,663
What I'm excited about right now...

534
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,793
is that rock 'n' roll, at this point,
is mutating.

535
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,564
It's turning into something else.
In fact, the term "rock 'n' roll"...

536
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,608
is over.

537
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,206
And I'm just excited to be at that point...

538
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,339
where the ground is giving way.

539
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:36,375
I can really feel it just about to go
under our feet, and I just want to let go.

540
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,045
You know, I want to go with it.

541
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,186
I think that's there's been
a bit of a revolution...

542
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:44,659
in popular rock 'n' roll
in the last few years...

543
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:50,092
with the success of Jane's Addiction
and Nirvana breaking the ground.

544
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,396
And I think that people were just sick
of listening to crap on the radio.

545
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:58,305
Bands left over from the '70s
still putting out albums...

546
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,710
and that's what the radio stations
were eating up...

547
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,973
and kids were like,
"This does not relate to me.

548
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,481
"This is not my generation of music. "

549
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,383
And so radio stations picked up on it.

550
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,920
Lollapalooza picked up on it,
and here we are.

551
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:26,792
I think what I look for in bands
more than anything is attitude.

552
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:33,066
I think that America has a really good,
thriving rock scene, you know.

553
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,906
People who have got something to say...

554
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,107
something other than, you know...

555
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,712
clich¨¦s.

556
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:15,543
The reason I chose Lollapalooza
as the title for the concert...

557
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,285
"Something or someone
great or wonderful. "

558
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,850
Two: "A giant-sized lollipop."

559
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,990
It's like this alternative rock thing.

560
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:34,799
I don't know how many times I've heard
that word thrown around, "alternative."

561
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,634
It's, like, alternative to what?

562
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:40,507
The media has really sucked up all of it.

563
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:44,513
It's the main genre of music...

564
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,277
that's really popular right now.

565
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,614
When I think of alternative music...

566
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:54,089
I think of just something different
from what's happening in the mainstream.

567
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,923
This is about as mainstream
as you can get. Not that it's bad.

568
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:02,430
You have a kind of multicultural event...

569
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,899
that's designed to open people's eyes up...

570
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:08,233
to new sorts of music
they wouldn't have heard before, and stuff.

571
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,170
This is great, and....

572
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,410
I'm not sure
if it's exactly happening that way...

573
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,744
and I'm not really sure
if this generation's eyes...

574
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,749
particularly want to be opened up.

575
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,342
It's the only thing of its kind
in the United States.

576
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,186
Kids just want to blow off some steam
and come to the big rock show.

577
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:34,724
It is all about...

578
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,634
bonding together in some way...

579
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:43,101
and rebelling against
the older generations...

580
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,869
and everything around it.

581
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:50,140
But I just don't see
where the rebellion actually is.

582
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:06,892
I might be a bit pessimistic,
but I think that rock 'n' roll is dead now.

583
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,727
Rock 'n' roll is dead?
What a silly statement.

584
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,133
Rock 'n' roll has now become
a conformity...

585
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:16,866
which is completely anti-nature
to rock 'n' roll.

586
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,305
Therefore, it's dead.

587
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,695
Rock 'n'roll, when it starts calling itself
rock and roll...

588
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,561
that's when it has its problems.

589
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:46,864
When you have rock 'n'roll groups
talking the same thing over and over.

590
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,395
When the music expands,
that's when it tends to do better.

591
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:51,702
Same thing with rap.

592
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:16,797
A friend of mine who works in computers
and high-tech industry...

593
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,829
said that for him, he saw a 21st century...

594
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:24,635
where people,
to escape the high concept...

595
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,268
and the agonizing realization...

596
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,438
that we no longer understand
or control our technology...

597
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,972
would want to go home
and touch something made of wood.

598
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,877
And I think that is kind of the place
that rock is taking.

599
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:43,890
Things like grunge, for me,
and Eric Clapton and rap...

600
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:48,321
have a small, comfortable feel about them.

601
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:53,531
They are almost tribal.
They're things that you can touch.

602
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,900
They're made of wood.

603
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,997
You can't kill rock
because it will always exist.

604
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:25,228
As soon as you assume it's dead,
up pops Nirvana or some other thing.

605
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,200
They'll try and sell it...

606
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,966
but the underground is always...

607
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,508
ten steps ahead of the lawyers
and accountants.

608
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:35,636
And so there will always be rock 'n' roll...

609
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,346
or hip-hop
or whatever underground music.

610
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,390
Now it's rock 'n' roll.

611
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,562
Now it's amazing to see black people
do rock 'n' roll.

612
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:01,195
"You're black,
and you have a rock 'n' roll group? Wow."

613
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,836
That's what happens when the rebellion
leaves the music.

614
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,838
It becomes Americanized.

615
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:13,248
I think that it's inevitable
for music to become watered-down.

616
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,749
It's inevitable.

617
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:17,480
But the point of keeping it rebellious...

618
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:21,489
is to keep people's awareness alive...

619
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,423
as long as you can.

620
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,727
I've no idea
what the future of rock 'n' roll is.

621
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,191
Nor am I really interested.

622
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,836
The future of rock 'n' roll: More surprises,
both hideous and wonderful.

623
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,022
English

0
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,250
Rock 'n' roll music.

1
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,517
It was the single thing that was
able to reach down, communicate...

2
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,549
and give you a sense of the world outside.

3
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,596
It's not even recognizable
as the same thing that people called...

4
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,326
"this rock 'n' roll that won't survive."

5
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:12,033
Mystery and mischief are the two most
important ingredients in rock 'n' roll.

6
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,300
This great music we've discovered,
this great music which is still growing...

7
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,741
which now you can write songs about
what's really happening deep inside you...

8
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,971
and what's happening around you
in the world...

9
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,106
can also sound extraordinary.

10
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,510
There's no reason why
it shouldn't sound as good...

11
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:04,553
as Mozart, or Beethoven,
or a great Ellington gig.

12
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,842
People let bands change them
in their lifestyle.

13
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,211
There's people
who listen to music ritually.

14
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,082
"God, I need to listen to Metallica
when I wake up. It's my coffee."

15
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,677
Or something like that.

16
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,484
There's people that just flip on the radio...

17
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,047
and just...as they go to work.

18
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,759
Rock 'n' roll is fun.
It's full of energy. It's full of laughter.

19
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,921
It's naughty.

20
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,801
Music is like sex.

21
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,074
You spend more time talking about it
than you actually do doing it.

22
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,250
Jazz was for the brain.

23
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,414
And blues, rhythm and blues,
and rock 'n' roll...

24
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,848
was from the groin, from the belly.

25
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,859
Between wanting to make money
and wanting to meet women...

26
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,259
is why we got into rock 'n' roll
in the first place.

27
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,855
We loved music.
We wanted to express ourselves.

28
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,129
But anyone who says he didn't
get into rock to get laid is lying.

29
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,404
In the '90s,
we've had time to look and inspect...

30
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,942
and analyze everything
and be influenced by everything.

31
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,447
There's not a whole lot of pioneering
going on right this minute.

32
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,982
The pioneering went on earlier.

33
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,705
There's nothing but rhythm and blues.

34
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,180
That "R" and "B" stands for Real Black.

35
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,446
Rock 'n' roll is rock 'n' roll.

36
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,213
And you're not going to beat
rock 'n' roll music.

37
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,189
If you do, I want to hear it.

38
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,856
Juvenile delinquents
played rock 'n' roll in the '50s...

39
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,485
and wore leather jackets.

40
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,492
In the '60s, hippies played it.

41
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,192
In the '70s,
there was juvenile delinquents...

42
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,861
but that was an old word,
so they used "punk."

43
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,502
Then they cleaned it up
with new wave and put a tie on...

44
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
but it's all about music and songs...

45
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,535
and what songs
are popular to people at the time.

46
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,609
You roll with it.
You rock with it. You move it.

47
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,979
You feel it. And you believe in it.

48
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,116
Rock 'n' roll is a commitment.

49
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,123
Rock 'n' roll is passion...

50
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,380
and spirit.

51
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:11,299
If I defined rock 'n' roll,
it would be freedom and rebellion.

52
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,061
It's what it's all about.

53
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,166
It's performing that
which you feel strongly about...

54
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,071
to other people,
because the songs just come alive then.

55
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,773
That's when they live and breathe.

56
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,942
And rock 'n' roll is something
that's hardcore, rough...

57
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,713
and wild, and sweaty,
and wet, and just loose.

58
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,058
I think there needs to be a certain amount
of outlaw to rock 'n' roll.

59
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,163
And at that time, we were at that age
where we really were those outlaws.

60
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,467
If we had been in the Old West, we would
have been bank robbers, I'm sure.

61
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,945
But luckily there was music around,
so we ended up being musicians.

62
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,577
Rock music is high-velocity folk music.

63
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,918
It is our life and times,
but with fury and some passion.

64
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,991
Rock 'n'roll is such a strong medium...

65
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,036
that it's almost too good.

66
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:27,163
It's forced to keep itself alive
in any way, shape, or form.

67
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,038
It does that through its agelessness...

68
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,578
its capabilities of being so euphoric...

69
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,811
that it can get anybody stoned
and caught and brought into its web.

70
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,345
To tell you the truth, that's what I think
drives the greatest music:

71
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,688
simplicity and truth.

72
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,255
It's a threat, really.
I think that's really the key of it.

73
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,194
Most kids hate their parents' artists...

74
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,427
their big sisters' and brothers' artists.

75
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,268
They want to get away from that
more than anything.

76
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,896
It's supposed to shake you...

77
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,961
out of your establishment place and say:

78
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,040
"Gee, I really don't understand that."

79
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,440
Exactly. That's the point.
You're not supposed to.

80
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,911
This is the next generation taking over.

81
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,676
And I can remember the same exact words
that they're saying...

82
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,877
that I hear a lot
of my contemporaries saying, like:

83
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,848
"That's not music. There's no melody.
And there's no words."

84
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,586
Rock 'n' roll started out on a corner
of the street, just like hip-hop.

85
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,288
A few Black people get together.

86
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,396
It's devil music.

87
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,265
About every 10 years...

88
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,637
everything breaks down
to the lowest common denominator...

89
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,863
and then it builds back up
to the same old shit.

90
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,910
But the only thing that survives
is rock 'n' roll.

91
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,471
You're talking about music...

92
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:19,250
that was bred from Africa
to the Black Church...

93
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,219
and over to gospel,
which turned into blues...

94
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,983
and jazz and country music.

95
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,253
And it cross-pollinates,
and that's the way it ought to be.

96
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,449
That's how it started.

97
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,721
It's only now, later on,
that I look back and say:

98
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,924
"I didn't start listening to music in 1956.
I was listening to it in 1946."

99
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,305
Without even me knowing it.
I was listening to my mom's stuff.

100
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,705
Whatever she wanted to hear,
I had to hear.

101
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,903
And so I was brought up
on a lot of very good jazz...

102
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,469
a lot of good vocalists,
and good guitar players.

103
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:52,176
And if you turn out to be a musician,
anything you've ever heard...

104
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,310
comes out in what you play.

105
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,613
You only need a few geniuses
and great musicians here and there.

106
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,625
That's enough to play it.

107
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,495
The real beauty and art in music
is listening to it.

108
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,368
In a way, Muddy Waters was the focus...

109
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,343
perhaps of all the good things
about that Chicago Blues era.

110
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,043
He had a great voice.
He was an interesting guitar player.

111
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,583
He used to play harmonica.
He had a wonderful band.

112
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,142
He was a big influence for me.

113
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,484
I knew him
before The Rolling Stones existed.

114
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,286
He meant a great deal to me...

115
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,059
and his music still does,
probably more than anybody else's.

116
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,569
I don't know why.
It was the first, really, that got to me...

117
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:54,231
and it still is the most important music
in my life today:

118
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,240
the music of Muddy Waters.

119
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,376
Everything that I have heard
in my life is rooted in the blues...

120
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,581
except Johann Sebastian Bach.

121
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,578
I'm a big blues fan.
I'm more of a blues fan than a jazz fan.

122
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,125
A lot of people might say,
"You must be into jazz."

123
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,058
No, that's somebody like Gang Starr...

124
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,358
or Tribe Called Quest
that entered the jazz field.

125
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,763
But me, it's almost like
if I was brought up in Memphis.

126
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,091
I grew up on the South Side of Chicago...

127
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,536
and the blues, naturally,
was a huge part of my life.

128
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,836
The blues and jazz were both....

129
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,767
If it hadn't been for Black Americans...

130
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,009
we would be doing the minuet
and dancing on our tippy-toes.

131
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,778
I have vivid memories of my uncle...

132
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,953
my mother's brother...

133
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,321
and my grandmother's brother,
who's my great-uncle...

134
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,452
humming and singing in the fields.

135
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,327
Picking cotton,
trying to get them 100 pounds...

136
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,662
before you went to the weigh-in scales.

137
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,426
They would just make up songs, like...

138
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:42,139
I just want to lay down my head...

139
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,344
John Westbrook was an old Black man...

140
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,513
who lived across the field from me.

141
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,386
He worked in the cotton fields...

142
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,926
which, by the way,
is the hardest work in the world.

143
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,693
"Child, I want you to take
your little fingers and do this."

144
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,775
I said, "Uncle John, do that again."

145
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,678
I hated picking cotton and chopping.

146
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,920
The sun was so hot. I dreaded those times.

147
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,619
That's the only thing
that made me change my life.

148
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,095
I knew that I couldn't do that.
That was something that, as a child...

149
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,327
I knew the beginning of dislike, and hate,
and "cannot do"...

150
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,161
and "don't want to do," and "will not do."

151
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,206
Country music is gospel.

152
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,743
Country music is the soul of the country.

153
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,643
Let's go back to that word "soul."
It's the soul of country music.

154
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,582
When you listen to country music,
you listen to the stories.

155
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,245
You listen to the actual hurt, the real pain.

156
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,423
I wanted to be
the first singing Black cowboy.

157
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:03,418
I never thought about singing.
Never thought I could sing until I heard:

158
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,191
Back in the Saddle Again.

159
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,625
Peace in the Valley and all those songs.

160
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,464
That's why I like country music today.
This is my influence.

161
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,664
This is the beginning
of Hank Ballard's singing career.

162
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,608
Gene Autry, ladies and gentlemen.
I love this man.

163
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,238
I treasure this photo.
I take it everywhere I go, Gene!

164
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,114
Both Keith and I like country music a lot.

165
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,417
It's the same kind of musical form
as blues.

166
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,824
I used to like George Jones...

167
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,127
Johnny Cash...

168
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,530
Hank Snow...

169
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,130
Hank Williams....

170
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,589
I got very interested in Hank Williams...

171
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,359
because I saw him when I was
very young, at the Opry.

172
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,630
The Friday Night Frolics, actually,
was the first time I saw him.

173
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,469
And I just thought
the way he approached his singing...

174
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,907
and the rhythms and stuff that he did
astounded me.

175
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,911
He was not like anything else
that was going on at the time.

176
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,114
I remember when I was 18,
I had one Hank Williams record.

177
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,653
And I liked it, but it didn't really hit me...

178
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,623
until I was probably 26 or 27.

179
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,252
And then I got into everything he did.

180
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,636
The country guys
bred guys like Buddy Holly.

181
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,500
Buddy Holly was a little bit more of a...

182
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,636
little sweeter kind of music.

183
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,705
It was the country ballad
with a rock 'n' roll base.

184
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,215
Buddy Holly had
a fantastic effect on people...

185
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,520
because he had great guitar technique.
And the songs were good.

186
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,790
I remember learning to play
Rave On, the piano bit in the middle.

187
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,234
And if you could play it,
you felt it was great. It's accessible.

188
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,169
If you can play it,
it means that you're in tune with him.

189
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,715
When you talk about gospel,
gospel is the truth.

190
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,252
And country and western
has always been the truth.

191
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,053
But just because the brogue
or the accent is a little different...

192
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,726
city folk made fun of that.

193
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,022
It's like a fever.

194
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,330
You catch the fever,
and it's like a gospel experience...

195
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,857
when you go into a church
with Black people.

196
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,232
They whip up this choir feeling.

197
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,934
The people in the audience
are right with it.

198
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,910
It's just gospel, know what I mean?

199
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,775
You let loose.

200
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,676
The piano was talking.
The drums was walking.

201
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,982
Everybody was gone.

202
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,077
People shouting all over the place.

203
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,247
And if you didn't understand what it was...

204
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,689
you thought you was
in a rock 'n' roll concert.

205
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,755
That's the way Black gospel was
when I was a boy.

206
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,017
And then they had that holler.

207
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,853
And I loved that.

208
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,658
They were just screaming.
I said, "Oh, my Lord."

209
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,300
It made my big toe shoot up in my boot.

210
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,375
So music out of the church
has always been my influence.

211
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,572
And even now...

212
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,077
I still say that there's such a fine line...

213
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,011
between gospel and R & B.

214
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:34,223
Many songs came out of the church
and ended up in the nightclubs...

215
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,761
like
Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean.

216
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,582
When you hear Ruth Brown sing,
you know there's some gospel there.

217
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,981
So it involves, you know, automatically...

218
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,922
and you can hear it. You can feel it.

219
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,327
That's what made the character
of rhythm and blues so popular...

220
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:17,391
because people who had
that spiritual feeling and background...

221
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:22,963
knew that there was something there
that drew you to that music...

222
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,703
that just made you wanna dance,
made you wanna move.

223
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,794
You know, R & B was a huge fire.

224
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,463
But then you start mixing in the country...

225
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,599
the best of the country,
the sort of really swinging country...

226
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,478
and gospel, can't forget gospel...

227
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,081
and to some extent jazz, I think.

228
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,777
Lionel Hampton and Louis Jordan were
probably the first rock 'n' roll bands...

229
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,983
that were really conscious
of what we call "the big beat."

230
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,758
And it was ironic
because these were both bands...

231
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,318
that had their roots steeped in jazz.

232
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,423
And Louis Jordan was a monster.

233
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,661
All during World War II...

234
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,668
when he did Caldonia and Beware...

235
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,301
and Salt Pork, West Virginia,
Choo-Choo Ch'Boogie.

236
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,436
He did shuffle boogie
and everything else...

237
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:37,608
with backbeats and everything else
that were all elements of rock 'n' roll.

238
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,911
I think he was really
one of the first crossover artists.

239
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,752
Louis Jordan had a great white following.

240
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,119
Louis Jordan was not only
the first rock 'n' roller...

241
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,132
he was the first rapper.

242
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,994
You got to dig
some of those old Louis Jordan records.

243
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,270
In the mid '40s and early '50s,
there were four major record companies:

244
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:11,332
RCA-Victor, Columbia Records,
Capitol Records, and Decca Records.

245
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,004
They were all very tightly controlling
what you heard...

246
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,980
and that was the blandness.

247
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,711
There was a thirst
for different kinds of niche music...

248
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,082
It was controlled by a handful,
and all of a sudden...

249
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,422
they built this interconnected network
of independent distributors.

250
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,223
We could make records in our garage...

251
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:35,130
ship them out of our trunk,
and become multimillionaires overnight.

252
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,760
That was the fun period.

253
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:41,863
It was full of imaginative entrepreneurs
who became very wealthy.

254
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,307
Now you had the big corporate types
at RCA and Columbia and so forth...

255
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,743
who were playing the game
according to Hoyle.

256
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,042
These guys weren't gonna
play it that way...

257
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,980
because it was their money on the line.

258
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,076
Their survival depended on
getting their records played and sold.

259
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,519
So they started paying off disc jockeys.

260
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,921
They started off cutting deals
with record stores.

261
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,583
You buy one, you get one free.

262
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,390
They just kicked the hell
out of the major labels.

263
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,556
People like the Chess Brothers
started Chess Records.

264
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:12,126
Lew Chudd started lmperial Records.
Nathan started King Records...

265
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,640
and Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler
started Atlantic Records.

266
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,971
Nowadays, people have schools
they can go to and study all this music.

267
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,809
But in those days we had records.

268
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,180
All over the world,
people used to collect those records.

269
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,448
The people that we worked with
on Atlantic Records...

270
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,148
for example, were from Turkey.

271
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:35,952
They came here with a knowledge already
of what was happening here...

272
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,188
because they were able
to get these records.

273
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,697
In those days,
those records were like gold.

274
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,266
Atlantic was a label run by jazz buffs
and record collectors.

275
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,199
Two of the company's executives,
Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun...

276
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,707
were sons of the Turkish ambassador
to the United States.

277
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,104
They called their label "Atlantic" for the
ocean they'd crossed to reach America.

278
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,774
In the '50s, they made records...

279
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,614
with some of the country's
most gifted Black artists.

280
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,383
I felt that I knew
what Black life was in America...

281
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,949
and I knew what Black music
was in America...

282
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:14,031
and I knew what Black roots
and what Black gospel music...

283
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:19,035
and Black blues from the Delta
that went on to Chicago...

284
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,401
and the Texas blues
that went on to the West Coast.

285
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,637
I knew what they were,
and I knew all about that...

286
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,505
and I loved all of that.

287
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,037
So in loving America,
I thought I loved something more...

288
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,209
than the average American knew about.

289
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,887
We placed such an emphasis
at Atlantic Records on bel canto...

290
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,287
on great ability...

291
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,951
on a Joe Turner,
who could have been an opera singer...

292
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,394
with that beautiful, great big
rolling, tumbling voice of his.

293
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,453
Big Joe Turner was a man
who could have crossed many lines.

294
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,548
He was a great blues man,
rhythm and blues man...

295
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,924
rock 'n' roll man,
and a reputation in the jazz field.

296
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,156
With a Joe Turner song
like Shake, Rattle and Roll...

297
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,033
and a Louis Jordan song that's rocking...

298
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:28,163
before you know it, you're putting
rocking and rolling together.

299
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,934
And rockin' and rollin'...

300
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:34,570
was a not-so-subtle way...

301
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,680
of talking about...

302
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,651
having a good time, dancing,
and sometimes it meant sex.

303
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,204
Thanks to Big Joe Turner...

304
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,967
Atlantic was present
at the creation of rock 'n'roll.

305
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,870
But the label's presiding genius
was the blind singer and pianist...

306
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,242
Ray Charles...

307
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,275
who blended jazz, gospel, and blues...

308
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,309
into an urbane, yet earthy new style
of Black popular music.

309
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,059
Ray Charles' playing is so superb
and he's just so good.

310
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,358
So I can't pin him down
to just saying this is church or....

311
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,397
Ray does it all.

312
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:06,096
Ray Charles is without a doubt,
as they say, a genius.

313
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,296
To me, he is even more so.

314
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,508
Ray and I became good friends.

315
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,606
We thought he was something from Mars.

316
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,173
We were 14 years old...

317
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,414
and we were still living at home.

318
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,647
Ray had his own apartment.
He had three suits.

319
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,485
And he had these older girlfriends.
He was unbelievable.

320
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,156
He'd have record players,
electric record players...

321
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:35,165
and Ray would take them apart,
glass tubes in record players...

322
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,669
and he knew how to take everything apart
and fix it and everything else.

323
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,863
I met him in Austin, Texas...

324
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,671
and I was supposed to be
just the traveling vocalist...

325
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,437
and work with his band.

326
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:50,613
I'll never forget the first day
when I showed up for rehearsals...

327
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,143
and I raised sand.
I said to my road manager:

328
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,983
"How's he going to play for me?
He's blind."

329
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,320
Because I had all these charts.

330
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,586
And I remember he said to me,
"Don't worry about it."

331
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,361
And the first night
we were together, Austin, Texas...

332
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:13,029
he played everything that I had done
like he had been in a recording session.

333
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:18,175
At about 1 7, he went down to California...

334
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,538
and when he came back,
he was so different.

335
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,974
It was just like another person.
He was singing different music...

336
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,679
and he was singing the gospel thing then.

337
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,284
It was like he had found this light.

338
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,592
I always wanted The Band to make
a record as good as Ray Charles.

339
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,192
He always made the best records
as far as I was concerned.

340
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:56,135
He had the best band in town
at the same time.

341
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,171
Anything to do with Ray Charles
was all right.

342
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:04,340
I remember the first time
I heard Ray Charles sing.

343
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,541
He was singing....

344
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,687
And my mama said, "Now that's a shame.

345
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,657
"That man has taken that gospel song...

346
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:18,055
"and turned it into the blues."
Because the original lyric was....

347
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,629
And then when she found out
he was blind, she really went off.

348
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,899
Oh, my God. This was sacrilegious.

349
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,404
In Chicago, yet a different style
of Black music evolved.

350
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,508
In search of work,
bluesmen throughout the 1940s...

351
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,173
had journeyed north.

352
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,841
In the noisy nightclubs
and juke joints of Chicago's South Side...

353
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,814
the harmonica players
and guitarists plugged in...

354
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,824
and produced
an electrifying new brand of blues.

355
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,352
Dad would take me down
to Maxwell Street...

356
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,558
which was kind of like, I guess,
Portobello Road in London or something...

357
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:01,003
but it'd be street musicians
and just wonderful sounds.

358
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,938
Everything.

359
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,603
Living in Chicago
was quite a rich environment.

360
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,444
Chicago is also a place...

361
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,108
that you learn to play
many different types of music...

362
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,118
because you have jazz clubs, blues clubs.

363
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,212
All the different types of music
are very popular there.

364
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,124
And I got a job at Chess Records.

365
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,554
I was a studio musician, studio drummer.

366
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,597
Working at Chess
was a very interesting time of my life.

367
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,063
Anything could happen.

368
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:32,330
I remember Bo Diddley because I used
to run into him in the studio all the time.

369
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,835
Leonard Chess loved the blues.

370
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,398
Any time they had a session,
they would call Bo Diddley in...

371
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,377
and Bo Diddley was like an A and R man.

372
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,573
Because he lived in Chicago...

373
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:47,880
Leonard Chess could not
A and R a session.

374
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,715
They ran the technical side...

375
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:53,917
but Bo Diddley was really the man
who set down that pattern.

376
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,912
Bo's one of my favorite guitar players.

377
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,416
He only plays one chord,
but I can listen to that for days.

378
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,917
It's just so cool.

379
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,430
Bo Diddley by Bo Diddley.

380
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,232
I remember listening to it
in one of those earphones.

381
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,137
A friend of mine in high school
said, "Have you heard Bo?"

382
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,607
I says, "No." And it changed me.

383
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:51,448
The beat and the rhythms and the things,
it haunted me.

384
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,452
So I tuned my guitar to G and everything
because of that.

385
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,353
Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Bo Diddley, Fats Domino.

386
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,856
This is like the air we breathe, you know?

387
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,691
As far as I'm concerned,
this is our classical music.

388
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:09,329
Fats Domino, of course, inspired me...

389
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,392
because he can make
three chords sound so good.

390
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:17,363
Instead of, like, you know....

391
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:21,104
He did it in a nice, picturesque way...

392
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,376
as to bring out the beauty
of just three chords...

393
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,382
almost like a blues singer.

394
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,648
But at the same time, an R & B singer.

395
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,758
Boy, when I heard that guy doing that...

396
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,199
Fats and all his trills that he would do,
he was absolutely brilliant.

397
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,930
All guitar players were influenced
by Chuck Berry.

398
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:23,531
Chuck Berry is one of the founders...

399
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:28,605
of what came out of rhythm and blues
and became known as rock 'n' roll.

400
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,407
How big an influence?

401
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:34,117
I don't know, but the first time
I went to go sing a Chuck Berry song...

402
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,710
I'd never tried to sing one...

403
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,584
I realized that I knew all the words...

404
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,114
and I could play it without even
having ever tried to play it before.

405
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,756
I knew when I first heard Maybellene.

406
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,196
I said, "Look out, here is a Black man
that likes country music."

407
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,551
Without a doubt, the greatest poet
in rock 'n' roll would be Chuck Berry.

408
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:56,032
I always felt that Chuck Berry
was the poet laureate of America.

409
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:01,529
He probably was the best lyric writer
I was ever around...

410
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,701
and he was awesome on the stage as well.

411
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,233
Chuck Berry was an act
you didn't want to try to follow.

412
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,043
When he got out and did his duck walk
with that out-of-tune guitar...

413
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,812
which most of the time it was,
but nobody cared...

414
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:18,321
the crowd was making more noise
than his guitar was.

415
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,558
Let's go back to who was
the king of rock 'n' roll.

416
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,322
You know, you've often
heard Little Richard...

417
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:29,560
come on television and say,
"I was the king of rock 'n' roll."

418
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:30,895
I agree.

419
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:34,395
I also would like to add
Chuck Berry with it.

420
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,236
But Little Richard was...

421
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,038
the star in that era with rock 'n' roll.

422
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,643
Little Richard was far and away
the most flamboyant of the performers.

423
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,309
We just thought it was
so against the rules...

424
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,851
that Little Richard
would jump on the piano and dance...

425
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,288
wearing his cape
and that wonderful pencil mustache...

426
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,589
and be so out there,
and we all went crazy.

427
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,094
I danced then.

428
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,393
We'd get up in the balcony
and jump around.

429
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,092
The balcony would shake...

430
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,465
and you'd feel,
"This balcony is gonna crash."

431
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,096
But it's rock 'n' roll,
and we're out there gambling.

432
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,636
Little Richard was Black rock 'n' roll.

433
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:46,369
I mean, we understand that Little Richard
was Tutti Frutti, Good Golly Miss Molly.

434
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,140
He was all those things
that everybody else wanted to be.

435
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,238
He was our Elvis Presley.

436
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,935
I think of Little Richard...

437
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:19,567
washing dishes in the bus station
in Macon, Georgia...

438
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,838
and he knows that he's going to make it.

439
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:27,475
He made it out of that kitchen
and into the history books.

440
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,680
That is great. His records are great.

441
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,518
They still sound great. They always will.

442
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:38,187
Black people, they drew
out of their community...

443
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,254
this powerful, emotional, majestic thing...

444
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,701
called Black gospel music,
and jazz, and blues.

445
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,705
All those elements combined,
played a part...

446
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,401
in forming rhythm and blues.

447
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,308
And later, as the whites
were attracted to it...

448
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:59,007
it began to be known as rock 'n' roll.

449
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,642
Rock 'n' roll is a misnomer.

450
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,579
There's no such music as rock 'n' roll.

451
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:10,626
Rock 'n' roll was something
that, just out of necessity...

452
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,687
was termed rock 'n' roll.

453
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,863
There was a man
by the name of Alan Freed...

454
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,928
who started playing
rhythm and blues music...

455
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:26,233
after the classical music station
went off the air in Cleveland, Ohio.

456
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,177
Hi, everybody. How y'all?

457
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:32,011
This is yours truly Alan Freed
welcoming you to The Big Beat on radio.

458
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,147
Every night at 10:00.

459
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,618
He called the show The Moon Dog Show.

460
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:41,080
He came to New York and
there was an old beggar, a panhandler...

461
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,854
in this town
by the name of The Moon Dog.

462
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,157
So Alan Freed couldn't call his show
The Moon Dog Show anymore...

463
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,632
because the old panhandler sued him
about the name.

464
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,964
So in a hurry to come up with a name...

465
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,334
bottom line was he decided that he
was gonna call it The Rock and Roll Show.

466
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:02,976
I think that Alan Freed is important
in the history of rock 'n' roll...

467
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,875
and I think I understand maybe
a little bit why the other faction...

468
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,414
that doesn't want to acknowledge that,
wants to discard him.

469
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:16,585
It's hard to allow a disc jockey...

470
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,458
to walk off
with that mantle of importance.

471
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,363
He didn't write, sing, or arrange anything.

472
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,629
He got on the air and played some records.

473
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,570
When you're on in New York
at night in winter...

474
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,766
there's mystery, there's romance...

475
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,037
there's danger in the air.

476
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,079
And that's what Alan Freed projected.

477
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,546
Now, Alan claims he started rock 'n' roll.

478
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,210
Alan did not start rock 'n' roll...

479
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,516
but he was the disc jockey.
He coined the phrase.

480
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:49,655
It was real odd because
we were listening to rhythm and blues...

481
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:54,221
and we knew the original artists:
Fats Domino and Little Richard...

482
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,992
would rip it up.

483
00:43:56,066 --> 00:44:00,969
And then the white artist would cover it,
and it was....

484
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,438
We didn't know each other at the time...

485
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,998
but it was really frustrating...

486
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:09,170
to know the real record and then hear....

487
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,975
I mean, God love Pat Boone.

488
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,575
Anybody can have
a hit record, God bless them.

489
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,179
But it just was real weird...

490
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,087
that that went on.

491
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,955
There was at that time...

492
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,689
an absolute wall...

493
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,694
an impenetrable wall
between pop and R & B.

494
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,962
There were R & B stations,
there were R & B artists...

495
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,698
there was R & B music
but it was not gonna get played...

496
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,240
in its original form on pop stations.

497
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,535
It was just too ragged and too....

498
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:44,047
In some cases,
it was a little suggestive or more.

499
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,206
Sometimes even explicit.

500
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,807
Now, Pat Boone...

501
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,547
here was a white guy
that took my music...

502
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,556
and made my hit,
and this was my chance...

503
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,387
to be a big star...

504
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:59,452
and he shortcut me
and going to outsell me...

505
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:03,431
which he did with my song that I wrote.

506
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:08,230
You understand me?
But by him singing it...

507
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:12,139
he really made it bigger
and made me bigger...

508
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,803
but at the time, I didn't feel that way.

509
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,310
Rock 'n' roll...

510
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,823
is the greatest music that's ever been...

511
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,290
and ever will be.

512
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,888
Whether it was taken from gospel roots...

513
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,487
or whether it was taken
from rhythm and blues roots...

514
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:45,695
or black roots, red roots,
blue roots, or whatever roots...

515
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,862
rock 'n' roll is rock 'n' roll.

516
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,630
Bill Haley started
as Bill Haley and the Saddlemen...

517
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,433
a country band in Chester, Pennsylvania.

518
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,939
He was one of the creators of rockabilly...

519
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,453
and it goes way back
to '54, '53, on Essex Records.

520
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:08,423
All of those wonderful precursors
of rock 'n' roll. Kids loved it.

521
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,326
Bill Haley was country to the bone.

522
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,387
He was really a country guy...

523
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,831
who had the saxophone...

524
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:21,837
and had that great record.

525
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:26,638
He had many, but Rock Around the Clock
was a pattern-setter, let's face it.

526
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,978
I think one of the attractions of Bill Haley
was that he was....

527
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:12,454
Apart from the great music
and the new style of energy...

528
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:16,083
was that he seemed to be one of us.
He seemed to be a normal guy.

529
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,053
Even though
he had this funny curl and stuff...

530
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,790
and he was a little overweight maybe.

531
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:23,298
I specifically remember
seeing Blackboard Jungle...

532
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:27,201
and going down the stairs in the cinema
in Manchester, where I lived...

533
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:31,200
and seeing all the Teddy boys
tearing up seats in the cinema...

534
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:34,540
and seeing people turn fire hoses on them.

535
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,476
It was quite wild.

536
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:39,276
I think he was more popular in England
than he was here.

537
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,579
He was a god in England.

538
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:45,918
I didn't see that kind of energy
until later when the Beatles first hit.

539
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,981
There was something
about Bill Haley that was...

540
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,392
very close to our hearts
and yet very unattainable.

541
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,466
I have in my wallet....

542
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,403
There's my ticket
for the Bill Haley show in 1958...

543
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:06,101
at the Palace Theatre in Manchester
that changed my life.

544
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,578
So when Elvis Presley came on the scene...

545
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,774
the only thing I can say
is that he did it right.

546
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,414
He did it good, you know.

547
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,717
And again, where Elvis was concerned...

548
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,756
there was no color line
because everybody liked his music.

549
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:24,783
And Elvis Presley was
what they were looking for...

550
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:28,763
to get that music not necessarily
accepted, because it had already been...

551
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:32,791
but permissible for the white kids
to listen to openly.

552
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,895
People are amazed at Elvis,
at his influence. I'm not.

553
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,268
And, honey, it didn't come
just from his music.

554
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,542
It came from what he could say...

555
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,641
in just the little innuendoes of his voice.

556
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:55,221
He could do things that had to be
something other than carnal.

557
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,658
It had to be a spiritual communication.

558
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:03,098
I listened to it, to where he was
coming from when he was singing it...

559
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,793
and where the band were coming from...

560
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,166
and the way that
they were playing and swinging...

561
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:10,035
and the way Presley was taking...

562
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:13,907
all that white poor-boy
Tupelo, Mississippi guy...

563
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,869
and all the radio he'd heard...

564
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:19,541
Arthur Crudup, The Ink Spots,
all that stuff is in his voice.

565
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,518
Elvis was so crucial.

566
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,817
I remember...

567
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,086
writing arrangements for Tommy Dorsey...

568
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,127
on the Saturday Night Bandstand...

569
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,754
which was the replacement
for Jackie Gleason...

570
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,321
and one night...

571
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,494
this little kid came from Memphis
and sang on the show.

572
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,835
The band was pissed off, you know...

573
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:47,274
and they couldn't play with each other
or get into it at all...

574
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,073
and Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey
had the band.

575
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,673
I remember Sam Phillips said,
"We'll send for the band from Memphis. "

576
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:56,185
They came back up,
and Elvis played on that show.

577
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,413
And Tommy was upset.

578
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:01,116
He said, "Man, this dude,
he'll be out of here tomorrow."

579
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,721
And two days later,
they got 8,000 letters...

580
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:05,955
and it was over.

581
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:09,055
Three or four weeks later,
he played on the Sullivan Show...

582
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,363
and Elvis was on that show,
the Saturday Night Bandstand...

583
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,926
until it closed, you know.

584
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:38,388
See, in white society,
movement of the butt, shaking of the leg...

585
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,896
all that was considered obscene
for white folks.

586
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,989
Now here's this white boy...

587
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,693
up there grinding...

588
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,431
rolling his belly,
and shaking that notorious leg.

589
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,905
I hadn't even seen
the Black dudes doing that.

590
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:55,138
Elvis had some movements
I had never witnessed.

591
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,475
One time I went
to a country music show...

592
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:01,278
at Baton Rouge High School,
and there was a guy in this pink suit...

593
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,410
with a guitar player and a bass player...

594
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,456
and it was Elvis singing
Blue Moon of Kentucky.

595
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:10,789
I remember going with my friend
back behind the auditorium...

596
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,628
"Wow, this guy is really cool. "

597
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:42,420
Elvis, he was rock 'n' roll.

598
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,956
That's rock 'n' roll, you know?

599
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:49,624
Rock 'n' roll, really, I can get down
to about six or seven people.

600
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:55,469
But he was above it all.

601
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,404
He was rock 'n' roll.

1
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,114
We've set up a 20-man committee...

2
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:58,947
to do away with this vulgar,
animalistic, nigger rock 'n' roll bop.

3
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:09,099
The obscenity and vulgarity
of the rock 'n' roll music...

4
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,698
is obviously a means
by which the white man and his children...

5
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,867
can be driven to the level with the nigger.

6
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,962
I think Chuck Berry
is probably up way at the top...

7
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,630
of being considered
the father of rock 'n' roll...

8
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,640
only because
he has influenced so many people.

9
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:53,145
I mean, the Beatles, everybody.
But he started this whole thing.

10
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,450
He can go in any way.

11
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,616
He doesn't have to carry a band,
'cause everybody knows his music.

12
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,252
If you can't play Chuck Berry,
you can't work in no club.

13
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,393
If you ever played,
you had to know certain songs.

14
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,229
If you didn't, they'd say,
"You're not a rock-and-roller."

15
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,689
There was an integration problem
in this town...

16
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,956
and in this part of America.

17
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,965
Pretty severe integration problem
back then.

18
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,997
But there was no integration in music.

19
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,195
When you walked up to...

20
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,834
an old '54 or '55 model Wurlitzer jukebox...

21
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:08,580
and it said "Blue Suede Shoes,
Carl Perkins, white..."

22
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,218
"Blueberry Hill, Fats Domino, black."

23
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,651
No, there was no difference.

24
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:20,655
Kids danced to Little Richard,
Chuck Berry, Elvis, Carl.

25
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,296
Chuck Berry said to me one time,
"You know, Carl...

26
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:30,268
"we might be doing
as much with our music...

27
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,805
"as our leaders are in Washington
to break down the barriers."

28
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,971
He was right.

29
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,377
...pot of integration...

30
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,749
out of which will come
a conglomerated mulatto....

31
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,093
We used a to go motorcade
when we did a lot of the tours.

32
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,653
Like, we would follow each other.

33
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,598
All of a sudden,
these troopers came from nowhere...

34
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,295
and they stopped us.

35
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,532
It wasn't about, "Well, what do we do?"

36
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,573
It wasn't about that. It was like,
"Get in them cars and follow us."

37
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,204
He took us way back up
in the woods somewhere.

38
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,245
It was like a house...

39
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,044
sitting way back off the road,
up in the woods.

40
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,653
And they filed us all out in the cars.

41
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,887
They put the ladies in one room,
and they had these cells in the back.

42
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,859
They made the guys take off
all their jewelry...

43
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,228
give up the money, everything...

44
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,401
and put them in the cells.

45
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:39,063
They had their little kangaroo court.
We had to pay to get out of there.

46
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,075
We were lucky to get out of there,
but maybe there were so many of us.

47
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,010
I remember those times well.
They really do happen.

48
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,854
Rock 'n'roll music is black music.

49
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,684
If it was white music,
I would say it's white music.

50
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,730
But it's nothing but rhythm and blues.

51
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,061
That "r & b" stands for "real black. "

52
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,463
Same old blues, but what we did...

53
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,066
we took boogie-woogie that black people
was playing all the time...

54
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,408
and we put the blues
and the boogie-woogie together.

55
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,679
Rock 'n' roll.

56
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,446
See, rock 'n' roll is nothing
but rhythm and blues up-tempo.

57
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,579
Rhythm and blues up-tempo
is boogie-woogie.

58
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,346
It's just like....

59
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,986
Boogie-woogie. That's Lucille.

60
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,284
My music broke down racial barriers.

61
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,820
I would play places,
and they would have white spectators.

62
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,687
The white people would sit upstairs.

63
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,195
The black people would be downstairs,
'cause that was a black band.

64
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,526
And the white people
would leap over the balcony...

65
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,795
come down where we were,
and the audience would start integrating...

66
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,701
because music has no racial boundary.

67
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,510
Little Richard is an institution,
and the books is closed on that.

68
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,075
All you can do when you say
"Little Richard," is think of rock 'n' roll.

69
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,554
I was still a different complexion,
you know.

70
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,358
It was hard for me, 'cause the white girls
were screaming over me...

71
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,956
and the system didn't like that.

72
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,968
But I wasn't after the girls.
I wasn't after the boys.

73
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,802
I was there to entertain them
and to give them some joy.

74
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,583
I didn't believe when people attacked it
saying the purpose of rock 'n' roll...

75
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,122
was to lower the white man
to the level of the Negro.

76
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,919
But it turned out it was true.

77
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,392
It did, I think,
raise us to the level of the Negro.

78
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,897
It raised us into being more emotional,
more honest...

79
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,295
being in touch with our feelings.

80
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,330
But we was one of the main doors
that it came through.

81
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,170
Chuck Berry was a main door himself.

82
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,568
And we're not saying
that Elvis wasn't a main door.

83
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,272
I would never say that.

84
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:46,351
Because Elvis started white people
really singing rock 'n' roll.

85
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,925
Elvis Presley, I didn't miss a lick
when I heard him.

86
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,466
B.B. King...

87
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,735
Rosco Gordon...

88
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:16,700
Joe Hill Lewis, Little Junior Parker,
Bobby "Blue" Bland.

89
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,536
Now listen to this.

90
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,342
These are people
that nobody would look at...

91
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:27,185
let alone audition,
let alone make records on.

92
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,481
Then I'm gonna
take you to another generation.

93
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,924
'Cause I knew there wasn't a big difference
between me, except skin color.

94
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,961
And a lot of my "soul brothers,"
you call them now....

95
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,691
We didn't have that name for them then,
you know.

96
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,198
Then I go:

97
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,600
"As hard as it is
to get a black record played...

98
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,603
"what can I do for black people
as well as white folks?"

99
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,909
I said to myself, "There's got to be
a broadening of the base."

100
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,243
What's all this segregation in music?

101
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:00,752
Country music, pop music, race music.

102
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,380
Music, man. Music.

103
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,184
I had the perception
it was like being in a religious meeting...

104
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,889
that you really are digging
what that preacher is laying down.

105
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,892
I had that feeling.

106
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,493
"This sounds like, to me,
that this is something...

107
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,971
"that the nation, and the world possibly,
should hear and know about."

108
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,531
After Presley was on...

109
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,601
I received 700,000...

110
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,044
pan letters.

111
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,872
Not fan mail, pan mail.

112
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,042
There is no room in this city...

113
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,884
for the vulgar performances
of Elvis Presley.

114
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,058
I watched him gyrate his legs
and swivel his hips...

115
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,090
and our parent-teachers group feels
he should not be on television.

116
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,133
It was all on my shoulders.
They put the burden on my shoulders.

117
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,795
Like, "Uncle Miltie,
we'll never watch you again.

118
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,535
"How dare you put a man,
a young fellow like that...

119
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,100
"to gyrate and do those motions
which are disgusting. "

120
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,668
What did I do?

121
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,446
I called up Colonel Tom Parker...

122
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,484
about four days after I got the mail.

123
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,716
I said, "Tom, you have a star
on your hand."

124
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,059
A couple of weeks ago,
on The Milton Berle Show...

125
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,061
our next guest, Elvis Presley,
received a lot of attention...

126
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,428
which some viewers interpret one way
and some interpreted another.

127
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,525
We want to do a show the whole family
can enjoy, and we always do.

128
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:28,369
Tonight we are presenting Elvis Presley in,
what you might call, his first comeback.

129
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,409
At this time, it gives me extreme pleasure
to introduce the new Elvis Presley.

130
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,844
Here he is!

131
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,949
Steve had to more or less book him
on his shows...

132
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,521
to keep up with competition.

133
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,929
And come to find out
he didn't like Elvis very much at all...

134
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,395
and was very critical.

135
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,627
I must say you look absolutely wonderful.

136
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,330
I think if he'd had to go back in
and do it again...

137
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,498
he would have never done it.

138
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,099
He absolutely hated it,
thought that it was stupid, which it was...

139
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,771
to how they.... With the tuxedo....

140
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,943
Elvis just wasn't dressed....
It just didn't feel good for him.

141
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,349
-Thank you, Mr. Allen.
-I'm holding the guitar here.

142
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,482
It's not too often
that I get to wear the suit and tails.

143
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,920
A lot of people just don't realize
that this guy had a sense of humor.

144
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,529
He'd laugh and he'd joke.

145
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,591
He'd get you laughing so hard sometimes,
you'd fall on the floor.

146
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:30,862
People don't know that.

147
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,166
They thought he was always serious,
but he wasn't.

148
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,400
I got you a cute little hound dog
right here.

149
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,066
And away you go.

150
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,131
I always thought that Elvis heard
Big Mama 's record and rearranged it.

151
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,325
That wasn't so.

152
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,962
Elvis picked up his version
from a lounge act, I'm told...

153
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,438
that was playing in Vegas in 1956.

154
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,635
He copied their version, word for word.

155
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,713
In fact, they changed the words
I'd written.

156
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,943
"You ain't never caught a rabbit,
and you ain't no friend of mine."

157
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,543
That's got nothing to do with....

158
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,953
The original song of Hound Dog
for Big Mama...

159
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,151
is the story of a woman...

160
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,490
kicking a gigolo out of her house.

161
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,661
The first chorus is,
"You ain't nothing but a hound dog...

162
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,289
"quit snooping round my door.

163
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,699
"You can wag your tail,
but I ain't gonna feed you no more.

164
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,762
"You told me you was high-classed,
but I can see through that...

165
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,273
"and, daddy,
I know you ain't no real cool cat.

166
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,333
"You ain't nothing but a hound dog."

167
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,345
That's the original song.

168
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,912
Black, white, red, I don't care.

169
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,285
You've got to be colorblind other than....

170
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,185
Whatever moves you, moves you.

171
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,716
In the case of Elvis Presley, believe me,
he was colorblind.

172
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,696
He didn't care
what the color of the skin was.

173
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,632
When he heard something he liked,
he remembered that...

174
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,729
and his version was, believe me,
Elvis Presley.

175
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,874
This was a huge pivot point in America...

176
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,712
because it was the emotional revolution...

177
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,341
of young, white America.

178
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,215
They had never experienced music.

179
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:32,280
This music had been in black communities
for years and years.

180
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,854
And now it was exposed
by a white performer...

181
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,762
to the public at large.
They still cut him off at the waist...

182
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,197
so you couldn't see him shaking his hips.

183
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,598
Don't Be Cruel.

184
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,718
The black music from the South...

185
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,085
and the white music from the South...

186
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,091
that we were able to create
at Sun Records...

187
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,251
with Elvis Presley as a catalyst...

188
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:13,264
and those wonderful black artists
that I had recorded previous of that...

189
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:17,268
it changed the world
and the concept of not only music...

190
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,770
but how we think about our fellow man.

191
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,148
My mother was a bit of an Elvis fan.
We saw him on Ed Sullivan.

192
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,275
I remember sitting
on the living room floor...

193
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,952
and feeling something come over me,
you know.

194
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,491
And I said,
"Mama, I want to play the guitar."

195
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,497
Elvis Presley is like
the big bang of rock 'n' roll.

196
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,658
It all came from there.

197
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:53,404
And what you had in Elvis Presley
is a very interesting moment...

198
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,197
because, really,
to be pretentious about it for a minute...

199
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,540
you had two cultures colliding there.

200
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,576
You had a kind of
white European culture...

201
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,517
and an African culture coming together.

202
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,282
The rhythm of black music...

203
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,621
and the melody and chord progressions
of white music just all came together...

204
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,490
in that spastic dance of his.

205
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,020
That was the moment. That's really....
That's it.

206
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:33,873
Elvis didn't know how much impact
he was having on people.

207
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,214
See, Elvis had music.

208
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,075
But he had a look
that no kid before had ever had.

209
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,481
He didn't realize. I did, 'cause I played
some of the first shows with him.

210
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,892
I've seen teenagers
tear their fingernails off...

211
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,330
and didn't miss them
until the morning after.

212
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,160
I saw them crying...

213
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,700
when they didn't know they were crying.
Somebody'd shake them and say:

214
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,069
"What are you crying about?"
"I love him, I love him."

215
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,836
And all he would have to do
is walk out there and say, "You! "

216
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,838
And just curl a lip. It was magic.

217
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:14,751
See, God intended for Elvis Presley...

218
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,122
to do what he allowed him to do
on the face of this earth.

219
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,784
That's why he made him so good-looking.

220
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,654
I used to get close to him.
I tried to find a fault.

221
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,221
I wanted to go out and tell the world,
"He's got a big mole back here."

222
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,029
No, he didn't have a mole back there.

223
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,269
He was right, and he was my friend.

224
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,103
Rock 'n' roll is where it is today...

225
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,338
because the front door of this studio
was opened...

226
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:43,643
and that kid walked in here
and moved an awesome mountain...

227
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,946
that sat in the way for people like me.

228
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,680
I might have never got anywhere.

229
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,643
Elvis was the first white boy
to record in this studio.

230
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,179
Then I was second, Johnny Cash.

231
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,808
Then Jerry Lee hung around
as a piano player here.

232
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,580
I paid him $15
for playing on Matchbox one day...

233
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,680
when that million-dollar quartet picture
was made.

234
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,523
Can you imagine one little label
in Memphis, Tennessee...

235
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,758
having Elvis Presley, not forgetting
all the other great artists...

236
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,761
and Jerry Lee Lewis on it?

237
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,793
Can you imagine that happening
in Memphis, Tennessee?

238
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,598
And you don't think
we laid some music on the world?

239
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:22,340
We wasn't even sure
we could even get on a television show...

240
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,679
much less do a song
on The Ed Sullivan Show...

241
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,480
or Steve Allen Show.

242
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:31,784
We got turned down by Ed Sullivan,
but we got in to see Mr. Steve Allen.

243
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,417
He heard me do
Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On.

244
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,224
I just took my bubblegum out of my mouth
and laid it on the piano.

245
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,822
And my funny book, I laid it down.
I was reading.

246
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:45,165
I was only 20 years old. And I played
Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On.

247
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,133
He's tapping with his pencil
like he's playing the drums.

248
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,435
I knew I had him.

249
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,468
He said, "I want you doing that song
on my show tonight, son...

250
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,640
"word for word,
just exactly the way you're doing it now. "

251
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,830
What some people called race music
or black music....

252
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,596
At a time when this country
was very segregated...

253
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,398
there's a white guy singing black music.

254
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,769
It was an affirmation
of the value of that music...

255
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,968
and of your freedom to do what you want.
It was happening.

256
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,977
When the Crickets came along,
Buddy Holly and the Crickets...

257
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,706
it was so shocking...

258
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,114
that you couldn't help sitting up
and thinking, "God! What is that?"

259
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,079
So that's where I got excited,
hearing this stuff...

260
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,679
which sounded very raw,
very adventurous...

261
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,726
and very much spontaneous
and from the heart...

262
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,351
as opposed to this other stuff...

263
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,864
which, to me as a kid,
sounded like old people's music.

264
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,744
We did wind up working
with Buddy and the Crickets.

265
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,806
I'd heard of them, of course.

266
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,852
We met them. They were from Texas.

267
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,650
Phil and I were from Nashville.

268
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:02,051
It was so funny, the difference
from the Texas to the Nashville....

269
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,755
But we all loved rock 'n' roll,
we all loved Bo Diddley...

270
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,763
we all loved all this music.

271
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,129
It was camaraderie from the beginning.

272
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,794
They became very close, dear friends.

273
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,566
Buddy was a musical genius.

274
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,868
He had a great gift.

275
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,426
It is our feeling, here in Jersey City...

276
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,166
this rock 'n' roll rhythm
is filled with dynamite...

277
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,394
and we don't want
the dynamite to go off...

278
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,097
in the Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City.

279
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,231
What do you think
of the Mayor of Jersey City?

280
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,607
I think he's a square. He don't know
what's happening, that's all.

281
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,772
-'Cause rock 'n' roll is cool, you know?
-Yeah, I see.

282
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,748
I think that mayor
must have been nowhere...

283
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,308
because rock 'n' roll is cool, daddy,
and you know it.

284
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,512
Rock 'n' roll is the most...

285
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,522
and if they stop that,
they ain't gonna have no more music.

286
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,956
My department made
a very thorough investigation...

287
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,187
of these so-called programs.

288
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,354
We had telephone conversations
and correspondence...

289
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,695
with various municipalities...

290
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,562
included among these
being Hartford, Connecticut...

291
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,539
Orange, New Jersey, Asbury Park,
and the city of Hoboken.

292
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,277
We find that these programs
are not for the good of the community...

293
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,438
and that's why I order them banned.

294
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:37,848
Body music was not only a way
for the Afro-American to speak his mind.

295
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,525
But the general public,
and the white man in particular...

296
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:45,222
was frightened of this,
because of all the old myths...

297
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,355
about black sexuality...

298
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,959
and the fear of the integration
of the races.

299
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,004
At the time in the '50s...

300
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,769
most parents didn't want their children...

301
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,470
and this is mostly a white frame of mind...

302
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:04,241
influenced by black music.
It was very frightening to them.

303
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,676
When guys like Jerry Lee Lewis
and Elvis Presley got involved in it...

304
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,084
it got even scarier.

305
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,454
Because they figured,
"If only black people were doing it...

306
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,823
"then I can somehow separate it."

307
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,488
But when Elvis showed up on Ed Sullivan...

308
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,997
and kids at home were watching it
over TV dinners...

309
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,591
just after Mickey Mouse Club...

310
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:27,434
the parents realized
that music was a very powerful tool...

311
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,963
and they also realized
that this would be something...

312
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,645
that most kids
would absorb into their own culture.

313
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,146
It scared the hell out of them.

314
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,043
I tell you, I don't wanna even
be around good niggers.

315
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,846
I'm with them no-good Negroes.

316
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,012
That's what they called Rodriguez:
a good Negro.

317
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,521
I wanna be with the bad niggers...

318
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,853
'cause I know
what's happening with the bad nigger.

319
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,485
That's where I wanna be.
I wanna be with the niggers.

320
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,019
...the FBI and the Army
to force us white people...

321
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,658
here in St. Augustine
and other parts of the nation...

322
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,395
to mix up with niggers.

323
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,963
If he sends troops in here
and puts a bayonet behind each of us...

324
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,737
we still will not mix up
with a bunch of black savages.

325
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,807
I pledge allegiance...

326
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:15,819
to the flag
of the United States of America...

327
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
and to the republic...

328
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,357
for which it stands...

329
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,752
one nation, indivisible...

330
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,992
with liberty and justice for all.

331
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:32,196
They thought rock 'n' roll
was gonna destroy everything.

332
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,903
Rock 'n' roll was hated
for the first five years of its life.

333
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:40,502
It's so funny. Until the '60s came along,
and the baby boomers...

334
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,912
rock 'n' roll was having a real struggle.

335
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:47,076
They didn't like it. People didn't like it...

336
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:51,286
especially the press, especially the media.
They hated it.

337
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,730
When I graduated high school in '55...

338
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,393
we immediately got in the car
the next day...

339
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,528
came to Nashville, and got a place to live.

340
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,232
I went out to Wesley Rose's...

341
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,743
and he got us an audition
with Archie Bleyer of Cadence.

342
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,143
Archie came down to Nashville
to do the sessions.

343
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,445
Him and Boudleaux
sang a little bit of this song to us.

344
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,417
Phil and I, this was our chance.

345
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:58,046
We were looking to make this record,
so we weren't gonna say no.

346
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,521
We liked the song, anyway.

347
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:13,469
The Everly Brothers came out of
a nightclub they'd been at until 2.:30 a.m.

348
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,996
Instead of shining us on
and just signing an autograph...

349
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,906
and then going into the hotel...

350
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,946
they took time, at 2:30 in the morning
in a rainstorm...

351
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,210
to talk to Allen and I
and listen to what we were doing.

352
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,080
"Yeah, we do some of your songs.

353
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,882
"Yeah, we're little musicians.
We sing, and play, and stuff."

354
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,946
They were very kind to us.

355
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,187
And it affected me so much,
I began to realize...

356
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,485
exactly how important...

357
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,225
contact with your idol is.

358
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,068
Fats, this rock 'n' roll music
seems to be under an awful heavy attack...

359
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,408
from all over the country.

360
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,939
There's been riots. It's been banned
in parts of this country and abroad.

361
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,713
You know of any reason for that?

362
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,277
As far as I know,
music makes people happy.

363
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,449
-I know it makes me happy.
-You wouldn't blame it on rock 'n' roll?

364
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,219
No, indeed.

365
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,160
Phil and I met Roy Orbison up in Indiana
at a show.

366
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,190
And after the show,
downstairs in the basement...

367
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,461
we said, "Roy, you got a song for us?"

368
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,299
He brought in Only the Lonely,
and I remember him singing...

369
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,169
doing the demo to me
with the doo-wahs in the background.

370
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,471
I said, "Roy, you should cut that yourself."

371
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,477
That's what got him off the ground.

372
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,485
Roy's music was that
he was the ultimate outsider.

373
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:21,225
He had a tremendous physical frailty,
ethereal, otherworldly.

374
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,995
His face, the way he stood at the mike
and didn't move...

375
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,764
and his eyes hidden.

376
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,370
He had tremendously dark music.

377
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,536
I used to turn my lights out,
sit in my room, and put his records on.

378
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,978
It was so purely about
just the way his voice sounded...

379
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,642
that pure spirit voice
that came out of him.

380
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:51,786
I took a shot at it on some of my records,
and I didn't get there.

381
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,794
In the mid '50s, when I moved to Boston...

382
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,839
I had seen that...

383
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,934
hip, young white kids in the big cities...

384
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,947
were into some black music,
r & b music, at the time.

385
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,013
And so I started playing this music.

386
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,485
There was an anti-rock-and-roll feeling
in the city...

387
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,454
if such a thing could happen.

388
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:55,322
But, truly, the police, the church,
the city governments...

389
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,260
had a great reluctance
to allow rock 'n' roll...

390
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,128
to appear in dances and on the radio.

391
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,725
Because what Presley
and Little Richard did....

392
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,135
For the first time ever,
there was a division in music...

393
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,664
that what the parent listened to,
the kid didn't necessarily listen to.

394
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,302
And we were selling records
like we could not believe.

395
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:19,213
Kids liked a certain kind of music and,
for the most part, their parents didn't.

396
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,642
They had their own clothes.

397
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,586
They liked their style,
and their parents didn't.

398
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:25,952
Nothing ever changes.

399
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:29,481
The same thing goes on today as did
yesterday. They had their own thing.

400
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,291
Here is one song that will be in the top 10.

401
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,595
Where, I can't tell you.
It's Danny and the Juniors, At the Hop.

402
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,341
We directed the whole thing toward kids...

403
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,573
but 51 % of the audience was over 18.

404
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:53,148
Older people loved to watch younger kids,
so we got them both.

405
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,406
Many teenagers are as concerned
as their parents...

406
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,308
with the public's conception
of today's youth.

407
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,073
These students are portraying...

408
00:36:56,147 --> 00:37:01,107
what we consider bad taste
in school attire and behavior.

409
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:05,451
This student is wearing
an ankle bracelet, dungarees...

410
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,320
and dropped earrings.

411
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:12,285
This student is wearing
an extremely tight skirt...

412
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,058
and tight sweater.

413
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,263
Open shirts, black jackets, dungarees...

414
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:22,602
are mentioned in the code
as not proper school attire.

415
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,836
This group is our ideal...

416
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:30,275
of the proper school attire
and social behavior...

417
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,611
of the Hicksville Junior High student.

418
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,217
Also, during that time,
because disc jockeys became so popular...

419
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,619
along came payola.

420
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:42,648
And payola was an integral part
of record promotion...

421
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,853
during those years.

422
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,419
Each and every disc jockey
in this country receives...

423
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,829
anywhere from 150 to 200 records a week.

424
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,800
It's physically impossible
to listen to each and every record.

425
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,669
Record manufacturers, naturally,
are sensitive to whether or not...

426
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,437
the jockeys in the important markets
are at least listening to their records.

427
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,411
This is what the remuneration was for.

428
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,075
I know many people are going to say,
"Well, what's wrong with it?"

429
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,246
We're investigating it because
it has occurred over the airwaves.

430
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,548
And these are the property
of the American people.

431
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,750
It's common knowledge...

432
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,191
that some politicians
have this money contributed.

433
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,458
And this is, in my mind,
no more of a payola...

434
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,932
than a disc jockey receiving a gift
because he's been nice to somebody.

435
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,162
We never knew what was on the books.

436
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,967
It was very uncommon for us...

437
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,099
to walk in and say,
"Show me your books."

438
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,143
We were afraid to, maybe.

439
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:37,302
Because, in that era,
it was thumbs-down if you mess up.

440
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,080
So you wouldn't record anymore.

441
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,845
We were teenagers.

442
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:45,082
We didn't have any sense of responsibility
or business sense.

443
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,648
All we wanted to do
was get out there on that stage...

444
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,723
get in front of that mike,
start singing our song...

445
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,128
and try to get us a girl for the night.

446
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,928
That was it, man!

447
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,334
Business? What kind of business?
We don't know anything about business.

448
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,304
Most of us didn't even finish
high school.

449
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,171
So the hell with what people say.
I want my money.

450
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,210
And I want it as fast as I can get it.

451
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,473
It's a shame if I get it now.

452
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,539
I'm 65 years old.
I can't have the fun that I wanted.

453
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,245
But I still want what is due me...

454
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,413
and the pioneers of yesteryear.

455
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,354
We didn't know anything about publishing.

456
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,883
Copyrights and all that.
They kept that hidden from us.

457
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,660
But I don't feel bad about it...

458
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,800
because what goes around comes around.

459
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,563
We came to a mutual dissolvement
of the contract...

460
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,729
WNEW and myself.

461
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,236
What about the payola charges?

462
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,473
-What payola charges?
-That are rife in the industry now.

463
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,569
-Have you ever taken payola?
-No, I have not.

464
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,479
-It was about your personal integrity?
-Correct.

465
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,450
When you're on in New York at night,
in the winter...

466
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,010
there's mystery, there's romance...

467
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,955
there's something,
there's danger in the air.

468
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,924
And that's what Alan Freed projected.

469
00:39:55,993 --> 00:40:00,327
The combination of this revulsion
against the rock 'n'roll shows...

470
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,492
and the payola thing
got him busted out of New York.

471
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:08,095
He just was totally disheartened,
dispirited, and died shortly thereafter.

472
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,637
I'd love to answer
all your questions, fellows.

473
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,804
I'd like to be nice, but my attorney
doesn't want me to say a thing.

474
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,377
I'm trying my best--

475
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,118
I just can't say. I'm under subpoena here.

476
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,155
Whether it was the payola,
or radio stations afraid of it, it dropped off.

477
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:29,283
But rock 'n' roll
went into a coma, almost...

478
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,692
with very few exceptions.

479
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,330
But what most people
don't understand is that...

480
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:38,494
all those hit records that Little Richard,
Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison made...

481
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,163
all happened within two or three years.
And it was over.

482
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,102
I didn't know anything about it.

483
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:47,076
But my God Almighty,
God the wonderful Savior...

484
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,476
the God that died out on Calvary...

485
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,947
the God that spilled his blood for me...

486
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,041
he was willing to save me.

487
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,951
I was very sad
when I heard the news on the radio...

488
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,479
that Little Richard
had given up his singing career...

489
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,389
and thrown all of his diamonds
in the river...

490
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,486
and no one would tell us what river...

491
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,724
and he was going into the ministry.

492
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,265
His power was available.

493
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:13,326
I said, "Take me to God,
the God that died for Little Richard! "

494
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,701
I went back....

495
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,707
And maybe that change preserved him...

496
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,174
to be as great as he is today.

497
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,743
An entertainer is really
a force to be reckoned with, socially.

498
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,416
So let's put him in the Army...

499
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,078
calm this boy down.

500
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,815
Chuck, in jail.

501
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:38,558
Chuck went through a lot of things,
like white girls...

502
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,864
taking girls across the border.

503
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:44,867
In that era, if you were busted
behind things like that...

504
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,596
it was thumbs-down.

505
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:50,137
A little trouble at the border, you know.

506
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,399
Conveniently, Buddy went down.

507
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:56,375
I was probably the last one to talk
to Buddy, because I said:

508
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,974
"I got a registered letter at the post office
my mother sent to Fargo.

509
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,381
"Would you pick it up for me?"

510
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:05,320
He said, "Yeah, I need some identification.
Let me have your driver's license."

511
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:09,655
I said, "Here, take my wallet."
So he just stuck my wallet in his pocket.

512
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,826
So when the plane was found
the next morning...

513
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,866
they found four bodies
and five identifications.

514
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,494
Stars Ritchie Valens, J.P. "The Big Bopper"
Richardson, and Buddy Holly...

515
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,471
died today with their pilot
in the crash of a chartered plane.

516
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,839
Following an appearance before 1,000 fans
at Clear Lake last night...

517
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,674
they chartered a plane
at the Mason City Airport....

518
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,010
It's a sad thing...

519
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:36,018
because I think he would have gone on
to be a big influence in music.

520
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,379
Which he was already. But it's a sad thing.

521
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,058
Phil went to Lubbock.
I couldn't bring myself to go.

522
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,426
I think I went and stayed in the room
for a while.

523
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,725
Jerry Lee.

524
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,494
Whoops, she's 14.

525
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,864
The papers reported that
you were greeted with silence over there...

526
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,236
and with catcalls from the audience.
Is that right?

527
00:42:56,307 --> 00:43:00,903
I can't agree with them there, sir.
The audience was very nice and very good.

528
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,846
-Were you there, Mrs. Lewis?
-I was there, but I wasn't at the shows.

529
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,473
You weren't at the shows?

530
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,747
Did you notice anything like that,
that sort of reception?

531
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,811
No. It was a really good reception,
I thought.

532
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,481
When were you married?

533
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,115
-Pardon?
-When were you married?

534
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,286
Why don't we leave personal questions
out of this?

535
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,262
All right. Good luck.

536
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,958
They're all gone.

537
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,330
That is my theory on that early period.

538
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:31,471
It just suddenly got too wild,
calmed down...

539
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,941
and taken over by businessmen.

540
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:39,244
Teen idols were always on the defensive
because of the image makers...

541
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:42,843
making these people into something
they really weren't...

542
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,855
and were basically thrust upon...

543
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,756
the young girls of the world...

544
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,727
as being an alternate
or substitute boyfriend.

545
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,829
Some people liked that,
some people didn't like it at all.

546
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,630
I was part of that teen idol scene:

547
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:06,241
Fabian, Frankie Avalon, Rickie Nelson,
Paul Anka, myself.

548
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,661
I had no plans to ever be in show business.

549
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,525
Because of an illness of my father...

550
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,000
I met a guy on my front doorstep.

551
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,902
My father was being taken out
in an ambulance.

552
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,099
This guy had a good friend
that lived next door.

553
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,937
He was in the record business.

554
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,638
Certain guys of a certain look
were making it during that period.

555
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,705
He asked me if I'd be interested.
I told him no.

556
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,219
Frankly, I didn't know
what the hell he was talking about.

557
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,517
But then I found out
that my father couldn't work.

558
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,083
I was the oldest of two....

559
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,862
I was the oldest.
I had two other brothers and my mom.

560
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,430
And I asked him
if I could possibly make some money.

561
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,568
All of a sudden,
I was the head of the household.

562
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,433
He said, "I think so."

563
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,797
And I loved rock 'n' roll.

564
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,705
And that's how it started for me.

565
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,301
Howie Greenfield knocked on my door.

566
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,514
October 1 1, 1952.

567
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:22,440
I was 13 and he was 16.
He was a young poet.

568
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,813
He said, "Do you wanna write a song?"
I said, "I don't know how to write a song.

569
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,414
"I'm gonna be a concert pianist."

570
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,483
He convinced me that day...

571
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,724
and we wrote a song a day
for the next 52 weeks.

572
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,856
It was a Neil Sedaka sound.

573
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,996
Not bubble gum. I think the songs
were a little more sophisticated.

574
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:05,357
The cornerstone of pop music,
Aldon Music...

575
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:09,229
which was Al Nevins'
and Don Kirshner's company...

576
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,797
was situated at 1650 Broadway.

577
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:17,137
And there,
Howie Greenfield and Neil Sedaka...

578
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:21,007
Carole King and Gerry Goffin,
Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil....

579
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,076
People that were writing
all the top 10 songs...

580
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:28,608
were in that building in those cubicles
at Aldon Music.

581
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:32,549
This was the most exciting place to be...

582
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,350
because this was where
it was all happening...

583
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,791
in the late '50s and early '60s.

584
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,523
Songwriters, for the most part,
were given an assignment:

585
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:44,158
"Go into your garret and write a hit,
crank it out.

586
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:47,101
"Write it for this man, or this woman,
or this group."

587
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,171
It was a manufacturing process...

588
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,608
and some of the best and most reflective
lyrics came out of that period.

589
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:57,773
I remember the first time I walked into,
supposedly called, the Brill Building.

590
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,315
It was 1650 Broadway.

591
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,546
Al Nevis and Don Kirshner
had just opened the office...

592
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,383
and when we knocked at the door,
they said:

593
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,049
"Sorry, we're in conference.
Come back an hour later."

594
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,288
I think the conference was about
how they were gonna pay their rent.

595
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,522
There were little cubicles.
We all had pianos.

596
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,758
We were all in competition
with each other.

597
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:19,792
You could actually hear in the next room
some of the sounds coming through.

598
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,031
So all of the songs started to sound alike.

599
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:25,165
Will You Love Me Tomorrow
sounded a little like Locomotion...

600
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,177
sounded a little like
Happy Birthday, Sweet Sixteen.

601
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,373
At the end of the day,
we would all go in to Al's piano.

602
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,745
He had a red piano.

603
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,944
And we would play the songs
that we finished that day.

604
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,010
We were in competition with each other.

605
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,615
Whoever had the best song
would get a Righteous Brothers record.

606
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,904
We went to the Brill Building,
and it was like....

607
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,469
This was, again,
a couple of guys from Orange County.

608
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:15,314
I mean, we're dumb, stupid, young,
and we wanna have a beer once in a while.

609
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:18,780
But that was an interesting deal,
to go into that building...

610
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,291
and these cubbyholes....
I mean, all those little cubbyholes--

611
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:23,417
Factory.

612
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,018
Neil Sedaka, Carole King,
Barry, and Cynthia.

613
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:30,556
And we shook hands with a few of them,
met them a few times.

614
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,229
It was like, "How are they doing this?"

615
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,103
'Cause they'd just write hit after hit.

616
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,878
We loved Loving Feeling.

617
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:21,782
But you have to understand,
before it was released...

618
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,948
we didn't think
there was a chance in hell...

619
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,752
that that was gonna be a hit record.

620
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,292
-It was way too long.
-Too slow.

621
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,328
It was a four-minute record.

622
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:35,388
Even the producer, Jack Good,
wouldn't allow us to do it.

623
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:40,091
-He thought it was too slow--
-He didn't think it was a hit, either.

624
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:44,368
He finally let us do it, and it went
and reached number four in the nation.

625
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,602
Remember that?
He finally let us perform it.

626
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,804
He said, "Guys, I think it's gonna
be a hit for you."

627
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,920
Today, to find a hit song...

628
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:03,926
or a song that sounds like it's a hit
that you want to go record...

629
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,758
is really very tough to do.

630
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,363
And I guess Spector...

631
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,363
turned us on to the Brill Building.

632
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:17,032
He's talent number one,
best of any producer I've ever met.

633
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,905
More imagination. He's a great songwriter.

634
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,536
He's a great arranger, great engineer,
great producer.

635
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:26,639
He knows exactly what he wants,
and he doesn't stop until he gets it.

636
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,547
Never compromises. Never.

637
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,950
He totally dominated the artist...

638
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,519
and with a very strong attitude.

639
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,616
It had to be his way, or there was no way.

640
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:40,390
But like I say,
this is what it may have to take.

641
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:45,461
I don't know how close genius
and eccentric go together...

642
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,366
and I feel that Phillip is....

643
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,100
Was, and I can't say whether he still is...

644
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,739
because the business
has changed so drastically.

645
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,472
But Phillip was a music genius.

646
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:44,555
We had to create things.

647
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,654
We had to wear our hair....
Most girls would wear it 3 feet.

648
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,258
We had to wear it 10 feet.
We had to exaggerate everything.

649
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,962
We wore the slits in our dresses
because we danced.

650
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,733
We couldn't dance unless we had the slits.

651
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,742
So we created all that stuff, the eyeliner....
We had to be different.

652
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,095
On the other hand,
there were lots of other things going on.

653
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,496
That's always been the pattern
of American music.

654
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,431
There's a spawning ground...

655
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,766
and it does a lap dissolve
all over the country.

656
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,103
I've seen that go on for 48 years,
and it keeps coming, like waves.

657
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,838
Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller came along.
They did all kinds of things.

658
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,847
Lester Sill, myself, and Mike Stoller...

659
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:15,640
started a little record company in LA....

660
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,209
Very underfinanced.

661
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,447
...called Spark Records.

662
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:23,356
The guys at Atlantic Records
had heard our stuff.

663
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,519
They got hold of us, and they said:

664
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:30,157
"Look, you're not selling
any meaningful amount of records."

665
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,658
They convinced us...

666
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,170
to make records for them
that they could sell.

667
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,607
The first big success we had
was Searchin'and Young Blood.

668
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,482
Here were two Jewish kids
that knew my culture...

669
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,920
better than most blacks
knew their culture.

670
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,448
And they amazed me. I would look at them
like, "Who are you guys?

671
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,654
"How'd you know
how to write this kind of stuff?

672
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,560
"It's true, what you're writing about. "

673
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:06,261
But it so happened they knew it,
it was correct, and right on time.

674
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:09,305
We used to live a semi-black existence.

675
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,205
In fact, we thought of ourselves as black.

676
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:17,279
We were mistaken,
but that's what we wanted to be.

677
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:20,748
We aspired to be black...

678
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,918
and to be able to make the music...

679
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:31,658
that was black and the poetry
that comes from blues music.

680
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:33,262
We had black girlfriends.

681
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,096
We used to constantly be in...

682
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:41,934
totally black nightclubs and dance halls...

683
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,901
and we were treated very courteously.

684
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,740
I mean, sometimes people were amused,
you know...

685
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:53,874
that we might have been
the only white faces in the joint that night.

686
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,319
But no one was ever rude,
or aggressive, or anything.

687
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:18,968
Doo-wop is the music that was started
because there was no instruments.

688
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,274
So the background singers
had to do all the work.

689
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,578
And that's why the bass singer
would do....

690
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,255
See? I was a bass singer, too.

691
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,958
I used to walk up...

692
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:39,821
let's say from 1 19th Street
to 129th Street...

693
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,864
with the group The Four B's.

694
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:45,992
We would actually have a competition
with whichever group was in that block.

695
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,505
All you had to do is stand there
and start singing...

696
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,769
and gather the crowd,
and the others would come around.

697
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,709
You'd just actually have
a little duel between you...

698
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,543
and the group that's in that neighborhood.

699
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,949
And it was like one of those
fighting things without gloves.

700
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,804
I had a session to do with Jerry Leiber
and Mike Stoller.

701
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,410
It was the Spanish Harlem day.

702
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,510
They asked me, at the end of that session:

703
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,777
"You have any other tunes
that you've written?"

704
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:38,218
I said, "I have one I showed to
The Drifters. They don't want it."

705
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,052
I showed them a little bit on the piano
how it went.

706
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,887
He said, "It's not bad."

707
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,520
So he called all the musicians back in,
and we did it right then and there.

708
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,042
I wrote Stand By Me for the Drifters...

709
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:38,706
even though I'd had an argument
with George Treadwell, their manager...

710
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,181
and he had threw me out of the group.

711
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:45,076
That's okay.
I was still friendly with the guys...

712
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,987
and they set up a meeting downtown
for me to go down...

713
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,355
and for them to sing the song
for George Treadwell.

714
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,553
So we all got together
and went downtown.

715
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:56,861
The guys stood up there
and they did Stand By Me really great.

716
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,423
It sounded good.

717
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,503
And after it was all done,
he looked at me and says:

718
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,507
"It's not a bad song, but we don't need it."

719
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,367
So I took it, tucked it under my arm,
and I left the office.

720
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,520
If there was anything that people heard
in Stand By Me...

721
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:27,154
it was a sadness that I was doing it
and not the Drifters.

722
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:31,693
I had no intentions
of ever singing that song. Not one.

723
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:36,230
Not from the first time
I put the first word down did I say:

724
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,399
"This is a song I'd love to do."

725
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,833
Never had I ever even thought
of singing Stand By Me.

726
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,539
If it wasn't for the fact
that we had a little time left over...

727
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,911
the song would never have been born.

728
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,715
We fell in love with black music,
which is a product of black culture...

729
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,911
and we started imitating it.

730
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,921
And we made a career out of it.

731
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:30,719
Then, after us...

732
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:35,025
a lot of other young people came along
and started imitating it...

733
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:40,366
imitating the singers,
and making careers out of it.

734
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,003
And before you know it, the whole world...

735
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:47,668
is playing aspects of this music.

736
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:52,404
But it does represent
some kind of change in our standards.

737
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,577
What has happened to our concepts...

738
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,587
of beauty, decency, and morality?

739
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,680
The funny part about it was
someone asked me:

740
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:03,317
"What's the most significant
rock 'n' roll record ever?"

741
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:06,362
I said, "Easy. It's The Twist. "
He said, "The Twist?

742
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,159
"What redeeming qualities
did The Twist have?"

743
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,860
I said, "It was the first time
in musical history...

744
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:16,337
"that all generations could freely admit
that they liked rock 'n' roll music."

745
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,499
November 1 1, 1950.

746
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,467
I wrote a song called Twist.

747
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,670
I rewrote it three or four times
before it came out.

748
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:28,308
The first people that had a shot at Twist
was B.J. Records.

749
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:32,678
When I first took it to them, they stuck it
in the vault. They didn't like it.

750
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,656
I rewrote the lyrics,
changed my groove and everything...

751
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:39,252
because I knew the lyric "twist"
had to be a hit. Just the lyric.

752
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:43,025
I saw a pair of black kids in the studio
at American Bandstand...

753
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,567
doing this strange-looking thing.
I said, "What is it?"

754
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,193
They said, "It's the twist."

755
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,034
I said, "Hank Ballard did that
about a year ago."

756
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:53,667
They said, "But there isn't anything
to dance to it now, so we improvised."

757
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,303
So I said to Bernie Lowe,
who owned Cameo Records:

758
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,210
"There's a wonderful opportunity
out there.

759
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,478
"Kids need a dance record
for a dance called the twist.

760
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,019
"Get me one.
You remember the Ballard song.

761
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,385
"Do it. Turn it sideways. Write a new one."

762
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:10,153
He sent me back a record
with Chubby Checker on it...

763
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:11,853
that had two sides.

764
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,624
He liked the other side.
I don't even remember what it was.

765
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:16,255
I said, "No, I need the twist."

766
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,062
He said, "We couldn't change it enough,
so we did it again."

767
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,468
This is a pretty frightening thing.
It's sweeping all over the country.

768
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,871
Hottest dance sensation in four years.
A thing called the twist.

769
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,206
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Chubby Checker!

770
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:53,099
It was doing hips...

771
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:57,362
and that was nasty in 1959, 1960.
They don't do things like that.

772
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:02,471
We just got over the jitterbug.
We just got over Elvis Presley gyrating.

773
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:06,174
We just got over kids going crazy
dancing to Little Richard.

774
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,046
"Tutti frutti au rutti."

775
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:11,211
I mean, now we got this?

776
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,826
When I first heard about Chubby Checker,
I thought it was me.

777
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,626
I'm back there in Miami taking me a swim.

778
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:25,690
I heard this Twist record
blasting across white radio.

779
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,737
I thought, "Man, at last
I'm getting some white airplay.

780
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,399
"Yeah, I'm gonna be a superstar."

781
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,034
The disc jockey said, "Chubby Checker."

782
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,903
To regulars at the Peppermint,
the twist is not new.

783
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,845
But then society discovered it.

784
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:44,410
Almost overnight, the Rolls-Royce set
began to mingle with the motorcycle set.

785
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,250
The visitors to the Peppermint Lounge...

786
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,916
now include
such notables as Mrs. Jean Smith...

787
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,391
a sister of the President
of the United States...

788
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,054
and a United States senator, Jacob Javits.

789
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:57,395
And sometimes,
even high social standing can't get you in.

790
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,560
As many as 1,000 customers
are turned away every night.

791
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,192
It really is the in thing to do.

792
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,092
What would be
some of the out things to do?

793
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:30,425
I guess the only comment I could
make on that is, not to do it would be out.

794
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,400
If you don't do it,
you're just considered out.

795
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:36,165
I don't know of anyone
that doesn't do it at the moment.

796
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,402
You are knocking yourself out
having a wonderful time...

797
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,773
and you're not thinking of sex.

798
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:45,780
-What are you thinking of?
-You're thinking of green fields...

799
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,950
blossoms, Venice.

800
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,447
A Persian garden. You're thinking
of anything in the whole world but sex.

801
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:04,856
Soul, gospel, fusion, jazz, whatever,
are all....

802
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:10,171
They're shards of this large wellspring
of black music...

803
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,230
which is a product of black culture.

804
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:16,642
The whole world
is imitating these sounds.

805
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,872
I find that very interesting.

1
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,856
Next to this quarry,
a group called The Quarrymen...

2
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,219
performed at the Village Fete.

3
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:07,059
There are no plaques or signposts,
but at the side of this quarry...

4
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:11,365
is one of the most significant sites
in the whole history of rock 'n' roll.

5
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,134
Because this, in this ground here...

6
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,233
is where Paul McCartney
first saw John Lennon...

7
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,837
perform with The Quarrymen,
where they first got together.

8
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,408
From here, the whole history
of rock 'n' roll was to change...

9
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,085
and Liverpool was
to become the rocking city...

10
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,782
create a type of rock 'n' roll
and take it right back...

11
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,950
to the home of rock 'n' roll in America.

12
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,191
And here, at St. Peter's Village Hall...

13
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,723
just a short walk away
from the Village Fete...

14
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,429
where The Quarrymen played...

15
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:49,237
about 20 yards from the gravestone
of a certain Eleanor Rigby.

16
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:54,304
And in this very room,
rock 'n' roll was redefined...

17
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,147
when Paul sat down to chat with John...

18
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,445
and John started playing some chords
on his guitar...

19
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,456
and Paul started writing out
some lyrics for him...

20
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,617
and the two of them began to chat...

21
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,629
realized that they had a closeness
between them almost straightaway.

22
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,388
As a result...

23
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,231
the huge explosion,
exciting new rock 'n' roll...

24
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:21,236
hit the world in the '60s
and it was all born in this very room.

25
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,403
The two of them got together, met,
were kindred spirits...

26
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,778
and soon after, one of John's friends
went up to Paul and said:

27
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,917
"John wants you to join the group."

28
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,256
In the Liverpool home
where he lived with his aunt and uncle...

29
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,919
John Lennon dreamed of becoming
a rock star like Elvis Presley.

30
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,324
Just down the road lived Paul McCartney...

31
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,458
whose father once played
in a ragtime band.

32
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,203
George Harrison, who lived in this house...

33
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,569
and rode the bus to school
every day with Paul...

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,665
idolized guitarist Duane Eddy.

35
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,843
Growing up near the city's docks,
Ringo Starr played drums...

36
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,973
with Liverpool's biggest rock band,
The Hurricanes...

37
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,143
until he met The Beatles
in Hamburg, Germany.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,750
None of them had been abroad before...

39
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,791
and suddenly were in this neon-lit street...

40
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,383
with all sorts of sex shops...

41
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,953
and gangsters on the door.

42
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,330
They were just boggle-eyed.

43
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:27,031
They served their musical apprenticeship
in Hamburg.

44
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,907
They worked sometimes
from 6.:00 at night...

45
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,673
till 3.:00 in the morning,
and they exploded onstage.

46
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,649
The bouncers thought,
"Oh, my God, there's a fight. "

47
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,778
It wasn't.
It was the explosion of The Beatles.

48
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,449
Then we went back to Liverpool
and got quite a few bookings.

49
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,824
They thought we were German.
They billed us from Hamburg.

50
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,189
And they all said,
"You speak good English."

51
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,961
Brian suggested that
we just wore ordinary suits.

52
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,398
So we just got what we thought
looked like good suits...

53
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,267
and just got rid of the other gear.

54
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,043
Bands like ourselves, The Beatles,
the Big Three, and The Searchers...

55
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,342
and everyone, we all tried to be unique
and play our own type of music...

56
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,644
what we liked,
and tried to get our own sound.

57
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,550
And because we all were resident
at the Cavern Club...

58
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,418
that was the place
to come and see all the bands.

59
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,915
It wasn't just the music
when you went to see The Beatles.

60
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,894
You knew you were going
to come out on an absolute high.

61
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,557
This is Mathew Street. This is where
the Cavern Club was a really...

62
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,761
raving place in the '60s.

63
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,530
It started off as a trad jazz club...

64
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,673
and then The Swinging Blue Jeans
made the place very popular...

65
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,303
with the Blue Jeans' night out.

66
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,338
And then The Beatles started to play here,
and all the other groups...

67
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,476
like The Searchers and
Gerry and the Pacemakers.

68
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,918
This is where the Cavern was.

69
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,315
People ask me about the Cavern...

70
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,122
and I always tell them
that it was sweaty and it smelt...

71
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:59,024
but to me, it was the best
rock 'n'roll place that ever was.

72
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,395
And in the early '60s,
it was a place where kids...

73
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,532
could rock 'n'roll and have fun...

74
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,164
without anybody getting on their backs.

75
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,698
It was a tremendous atmosphere.
I don't know why, but...

76
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,005
I always thought that The Beatles...

77
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,513
sounded better at the Cavern
than anywhere.

78
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,376
You know, they were a lot more ballsy
than the records.

79
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,613
Brian Epstein, when he went down
to the Cavern....

80
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,886
Brian hung out
in a completely different world.

81
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,522
He was rich...

82
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,687
he had a successful family,
successful furniture business...

83
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,525
that had a small record store in it...

84
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,135
"Hey, have you got that record
of The Beatles...

85
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,036
"and Tony Sheridan, 'My Bonnie
Lies Over'.... Do you have that?"

86
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,968
After the 40th time of kids coming...

87
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,239
and asking for the record, he said,
"Maybe I better get this record. "

88
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,210
He stocked the record in, sold it out...

89
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,716
got another 1,000, sold that out,
and he said, "Who are these kids?"

90
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,950
"They are playing at this place
called the Cavern. Check them out."

91
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,993
The Beatles were then just four lads...

92
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,689
on a rather dimly lit stage.

93
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,529
I was immediately struck
by their music, their beat....

94
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,362
and their sense of humor,
actually, onstage.

95
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,468
And even afterwards, when I met them...

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,134
I was struck again
by their personal charm.

97
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,139
And it was there that, really, it all started.

98
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,512
We do like the fans...

99
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,883
and enjoy reading the publicity about us...

100
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,722
but from time to time, you don't realize
that it's actually about yourself.

101
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,589
Once when the boys came for me...

102
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,093
they popped in to see
me mom and dad, you know...

103
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,457
we had to go out the back
'cause there was 20 or 30 outside.

104
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,098
And they wouldn't believe me mother.

105
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,105
They'd knock in, saying,
"Can we have their autographs?"

106
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,578
The Beatles came down themselves
about 2:30, 3:00 in the morning...

107
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,274
and they were talking to us
and signing autographs.

108
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,117
And then they went away,
and then we sort of all sat down...

109
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,822
and some of the lazy ones
sort of fell asleep...

110
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,655
but the rest of us
just kept awake on coffee...

111
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,661
and dreams of The Beatles.

112
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,989
The Beatles were like a gift from God.

113
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,893
I was just at the perfect age for that...

114
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,334
fourteen.

115
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,170
Gave us all an identity.

116
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,003
And I've thought before,
just for the music...

117
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,981
it was such a bonus that the music
was, like, the best music ever.

118
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,595
I was Beatles all the way, man.

119
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,069
My bedroom wall
was in fact completely covered...

120
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,904
the walls, ceiling, doors.... Any Beatle
pictures were stuck on my wall.

121
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:39,116
I used to have these fantasies
of Paul McCartney marrying my sister...

122
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,517
and all this kind of crazy stuff.

123
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,254
And how wonderful it all was.

124
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,057
You're going over to the States
early in the new year...

125
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,526
and you're going to top the bill
on the Ed Sullivan Coast to Coast Show.

126
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,790
John, so far all British pop stars...

127
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,025
have not made a tremendous impact
on the States.

128
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,091
How do you think you're going to fare?

129
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,103
I can't really say, can I?
I mean, is it up to me? No.

130
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,197
I just hope we go all right, you know.

131
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,835
Are you going to vary your act
for the American audience?

132
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,278
No. We haven't really got an act,
so we'll just do what we do.

133
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,776
I went to New York with the boys...

134
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,407
and you would see men...

135
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,514
middle-aged men
walking down 5th Avenue...

136
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,556
with Beatles wigs on their heads.

137
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:21,889
And no matter where you turned
your dial on the radio...

138
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,120
at any time of the day...

139
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,960
you would hear a Beatles song.
It was complete saturation.

140
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,525
I think life for The Beatles in the early days
was very tough.

141
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,433
Once the success had come...

142
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,839
once they were not only a success
in England but also broke the breeches...

143
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,704
in America...

144
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,679
then they lived in a giant goldfish bowl,
and they couldn't escape.

145
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,709
Beatlemania.

146
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,257
D-day has been common knowledge
for months and this was the day.

147
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,390
The Beatles are coming.

148
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:00,796
It got bigger and bigger.
Finally we got to the point...

149
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,060
where they landed at the airport
in New York...

150
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,901
and there was 50,000 people there.
It was unbelievable.

151
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:12,241
I said, "This is it.
It's all over but the shouting."

152
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,036
We had never seen an airport
that you couldn't get to...

153
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,639
because of kids
standing out there, screaming.

154
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,750
We'd never seen kids
fainting like that at concerts.

155
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,318
We'd never heard screams like that...

156
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,882
that you couldn't even hear
the music while the guys....

157
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,894
And you knew they were playing.

158
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,897
We knew that there was a problem
that had just landed.

159
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,261
I knew that they were different...

160
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,737
and that their voices blended together...

161
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,796
and that they had a great talent.

162
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,604
And I knew they were going to be big,
and I hated them for that.

163
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,780
What do you think of the comment...

164
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,442
that you're nothing
but a bunch of British Elvis Presleys?

165
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,382
It's not true.

166
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,283
Are you going to get
a haircut while you're here?

167
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,552
-Nope. No, thanks.
-I had one yesterday.

168
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,788
And that's no lie. It's the truth.

169
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:09,395
I remember one day, I combed my hair
down in a Beatle haircut...

170
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,936
and my father laughed.
He thought that was so funny.

171
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,438
When he realized
I wasn't going to comb it back...

172
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,940
he got really pissed off.

173
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,983
These girls were losing their minds.

174
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,721
This appealed to me
in a very fundamental way.

175
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,857
I think I was about 13 or 14,
and these girls were going nuts.

176
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,194
I was pregnant...

177
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,566
with Kenya, my daughter,
when the Beatles thing swept.

178
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,638
And I remember
I Want To Hold Your Hand...

179
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:56,339
and I'd be in the kitchen
just sweeping and cooking...

180
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:00,382
and taking care of the babies,
singing I Want To Hold Your Hand.

181
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,581
I was so taken with
I Want To Hold Your Hand...

182
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,387
that I was up all night
'cause I didn't have a copy of it...

183
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,951
and I wanted to hear it.
They played it once an hour.

184
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,524
When we saw what happened
with The Beatles...

185
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,392
we had a meeting and said,
"What are we going to do here?

186
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:20,436
"We're getting eclipsed by a group
called The Beatles from London."

187
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,834
My God....
We were completely jealous as hell.

188
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,704
I guess that might have
turned our motors on...

189
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,111
maybe got something happening...

190
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,877
where we would be
better musically than The Beatles.

191
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,060
The Beach Boys were hugely important...

192
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,834
demonstrating what you could do
and what you couldn't do in a studio...

193
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,192
opening up the....

194
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,501
And Motown had
already done that to some extent.

195
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,700
You know, Motown had actually shown...

196
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,608
that black pop dance music,
R & B dance music...

197
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,837
could just be extraordinarily beautiful
to listen to...

198
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,906
and beautifully produced and elegant.

199
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,352
It was a very big influence.

200
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,257
When we first started to make...

201
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,687
a bunch of hits...

202
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,019
in Detroit...

203
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,863
and we called it the Motown sound...

204
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,933
people were coming from Africa.

205
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,672
They were coming from England.

206
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,143
They were coming from Chicago,
New York, Nashville and Memphis...

207
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,877
to record their people in Detroit...

208
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,917
because they thought
they would get the Motown sound...

209
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,416
like it was in the air somewhere.

210
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:18,189
Motown is history. It is the greatest.
And there will always be a Motown.

211
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,889
And when you look at Motown
and listen to Motown...

212
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,224
and listen to any artist
that comes from Motown...

213
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,490
you think of Berry Gordy...

214
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,265
Stevie Wonder...

215
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,691
The Supremes...

216
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,133
The Four Tops...

217
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,297
Marvin Gaye...

218
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,235
Temptations....

219
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,042
You have to think of just these people...

220
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,045
because that was the foundation
of the Detroit sound.

221
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,410
And it lives today, and it will always live.

222
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,956
The music of the time,
like The Beach Boys and Motown...

223
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,290
really didn't affect us,
because that was still American music.

224
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,898
America at the time was hung up
from these daft people from England...

225
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,594
these scouses from Liverpool...

226
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,467
singing this daft happy music
that they enjoyed doing.

227
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,166
So the Motown scene
didn't matter to us, really.

228
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,835
We had our own niche
with the American public.

229
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,510
1964 was the beginning
of the British invasion...

230
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,074
when The Beatles
finally broke down the barriers.

231
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,951
And I guess that,
because it'd been pent up so much...

232
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,513
because people were awaiting it...

233
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,890
there had been singles
released on little labels...

234
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,358
it came with a big rush.

235
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,494
And in that breach poured
lots of British talent after it.

236
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,267
I actually wrote it for my girlfriend.

237
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,600
We had an argument one evening,
and she said, "We're finished."

238
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,267
I thought, "How can
I get her to come back to me?"

239
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,866
So I wrote
Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying...

240
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,675
for her and I sent it to her on a tape,
and two days later she rang me back...

241
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,376
and she said,
"Gerry, can we get back together again?"

242
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,644
That young girl from all those years ago
is now my wife.

243
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,340
We were always impressed
by the English bands...

244
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,817
largely because a lot
of the bands that came over here...

245
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,951
were just the cream of the English bands.

246
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,582
Over here, we're exposed to every band,
and there's really bad bands...

247
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,218
and there's really good bands,
and everything in between.

248
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,593
But the ones that would make it
over here from England were the best.

249
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,665
Many people came up to me and said...

250
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,634
that the first time they heard us and
House Of The Rising Sun...

251
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,294
was on the Chuck Berry tour.

252
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,395
When we met Chuck Berry...

253
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,133
he was instrumental
in making The Animals...

254
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,336
really successful in America.

255
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,054
We were on tour with Chuck Berry...

256
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,288
and every band in Britain
wanted to be on that tour.

257
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,525
The Stones were standing in line.

258
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,897
Everybody was making agent,
managerial, political overtures...

259
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,530
to get on the Chuck Berry tour.

260
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,504
And we pulled it off.

261
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,341
I realized that if you try
to out-rock Chuck Berry...

262
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,937
you're wasting your time.

263
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,574
So I was looking for a song
that wouldn't be...

264
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,251
and would have a different feel to it,
but that would be very erotic...

265
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,725
and very atmospheric.

266
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,255
So we sang House Of The Rising Sun.

267
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,319
When The Animals first went to America...

268
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,050
we flew into Kennedy airport...

269
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,792
and the pilot told the passengers...

270
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,558
that we had to be taken
to a separate part of the airport...

271
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,999
because the fans
were mobbing security guards...

272
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,865
were creating mayhem at the reception.

273
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,564
And then we were hustled into a car...

274
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,107
taken to an airport building
that we stood behind...

275
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,643
and there was a press conference
with loads of chaps...

276
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,874
with cameras and notebooks
all sitting there very nicely.

277
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,706
And then they asked us
to go onto the stage...

278
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:49,220
and they said,
"Animals, do something. Roar. Growl."

279
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,279
All of a sudden,
we were standing in front...

280
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,223
you know, like animals in a zoo,
being told to perform.

281
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,851
Then we were hustled through customs.

282
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:59,295
They thought it'd be a great exercise
to be filmed going into New York.

283
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,229
They'd got all these British sports cars...

284
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,928
and we had to sit perched
very precariously...

285
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,867
on the back of these sports cars...

286
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,567
driven all the way from Kennedy Airport
into the center of Manhattan...

287
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,836
waving at nonexistent crowds...

288
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,437
and we were opening
at the Paramount Theater in New York...

289
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,347
and we did 50 shows in 10 days.

290
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,345
There was a great sense of brotherhood...

291
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,515
great sense of,
"We're all in this together...

292
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:30,794
"and let's go to America
and kick ass," you know?

293
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,959
The Animals and The Stones
were very similar...

294
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,294
to the northwest bands.

295
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,103
That raw edge to them, the roughness.

296
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,970
They weren't in suits.
They were sort of anti-establishment.

297
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,101
But we were all
cowboy fanatics at the time.

298
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,238
We liked all the Western movies
from Hollywood...

299
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,248
like all the John Ford movies...

300
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,680
and we thought,
"We'll go the opposite way.

301
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,812
"We'll call ourselves The Searchers,
after the John Wayne movie."

302
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,022
But with Needles and Pins,
it was such a big number one for us.

303
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,616
It was number one for four weeks.

304
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,001
Image was very important,
name was very important...

305
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,979
behavior was very important.

306
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,647
Music was kind of important.

307
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,718
What was more important
than the music you played...

308
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,849
was where the music
you played originated.

309
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,289
And for The Stones, they played blues.

310
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,458
Four months after The Beatles appeared
on the Ed Sullivan Show...

311
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,696
The Rolling Stones landed in America.

312
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,896
The band had taken its name...

313
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,167
from the song by bluesman
Muddy Waters...

314
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,742
and their barreling style
from rock pioneer Chuck Berry.

315
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,197
The British were going
straight to the sources.

316
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,236
Willie Dixon, you know. Chuck Berry.

317
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,171
They were going right
straight where it came from.

318
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,865
And they hit it hard
'cause they knew that's.... The Delta Blues.

319
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,912
They knew exactly
what the sources were...

320
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,277
because they were students
of American music...

321
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,782
and much more so
than American musicians were.

322
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,081
They gave everybody
a run for their money.

323
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,156
"Yeah. That's the band I want to be in.

324
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,125
"I'm going to be in that band."

325
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,240
You know, it's amazing
what the imagination...

326
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,836
and a bit of fate and determination can do.

327
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,519
The first tour was tough.

328
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,421
We were popular in New York and LA.
But the rest of it. Forget it.

329
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,464
We used to play to empty stadiums.

330
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,924
It was tough.

331
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,932
The America then was...

332
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,331
very conservative in its attitudes.

333
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,614
We had a motel with a swimming pool.
It was right next to a freeway.

334
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,653
Obviously, some outraged
Southern cop had driven by...

335
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,214
and seen these longhaired people
with no bras on...

336
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,117
around the swimming pool.

337
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,493
Five minutes later
up come the state troopers...

338
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,432
good old redneck boys, you know...

339
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,568
to arrest these chicks for topless bathing.

340
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,736
And then they're, "What are they...."

341
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,108
So they're taken aback.

342
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,974
We don't understand
why we're supposed to be arrested...

343
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,345
because, you know,
"I'm sorry. I left the bra in London."

344
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,713
Why do you like The Rolling Stones?

345
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,310
Because Keith is beautiful
and they're great.

346
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,878
And because they're so ugly
that they're appealing.

347
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,690
I think they're the greatest.
They dress different.

348
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,819
They're the best things
that have ever happened in the U.S.

349
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,457
We could see where we had an audience...

350
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,625
where we went down really well.

351
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,137
They loved it, so we could see
what we were gonna get...

352
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,800
and we had supporters,
we has disc jockeys that liked our records.

353
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:16,475
But, anyway, we knew we had
to come back and do it again and again.

354
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,118
It was a bit scary.
I mean, we had some very scary moments.

355
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,954
I remember one moment
that scared me very much.

356
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,051
We were in a limo, coming to a gig...

357
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,359
and the whole thing
was just engulfed with people...

358
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,762
just all over the limo.

359
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,825
And then I thought,
"No one's coming here.

360
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,270
"We're just kind of stuck in this limo.
What's actually gonna happen?"

361
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,065
The Rolling Stones had
a big influence on everybody...

362
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,303
as to what to do and what not to do.

363
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:50,370
You know, they're the best example
of doing the right thing...

364
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,939
and then doing the wrong thing.

365
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,714
The Beatles were the good boys.
The Stones were the bad boys.

366
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,846
Being the bad boys
may have been more fun...

367
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,391
and I think The Beatles
may have been jealous of that.

368
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,819
The Beatles and The Stones
were always friends...

369
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,692
but they were also rivals.

370
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,559
The Stones were
kind of upstarts, in a way.

371
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,091
They came almost, but a little bit later
than The Beatles...

372
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:17,741
and I guess The Stones were
the image that the mothers didn't want...

373
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,279
whereas The Beatles became the image
that mothers did want...

374
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,576
so, in a way,
that worked against The Beatles...

375
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,640
who really wanted to be
as rough and tough as The Stones.

376
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,813
I woke up in the middle of the night...

377
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,755
put it down to maybe a minute of....

378
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,792
"I can't get no satisfaction. "

379
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,697
And woke up the next morning
and looked at my cassette machine...

380
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,397
and seen that it's gone from the beginning
of the tape to the end...

381
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,565
and I don't remember doing any of this.

382
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,034
What people said about it
was that the lyrics were kind of...

383
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,513
very direct.

384
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,674
I just wrote what I felt, really.

385
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,631
You couldn't ask for better
rock 'n'roll-type people...

386
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,108
than The Beatles or The Stones.

387
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:38,310
The Beatles and
Gerry and the Pacemakers made it...

388
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,577
and The Searchers made it...

389
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,619
and Billy J. Kramer & the Dakotas
made it...

390
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,983
and there were no bands left.

391
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,217
They'd all become stars and gone
to London, and they were touring...

392
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,417
in the big buildings.

393
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,586
So the only club band left basically,
the best of what was left...

394
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,993
was Herman's Hermits.

395
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,920
Every band had to be different,
otherwise you couldn't survive.

396
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,322
You had to find your thing.

397
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,562
And Herman's Hermits
chose to go the pop sound.

398
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,564
I couldn't write songs
like John Lennon or Paul McCartney.

399
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,965
I looked silly wearing the leather clothes.

400
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:35,335
You know, I didn't look like
a Gene Vincent-type character.

401
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,878
I wasn't part of a band,
so we chose to be like a pop band.

402
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,040
We went, "Let's do good romantic songs.

403
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:49,450
"Let's make records like old movies
where everyone lives happily ever after. "

404
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,861
I had become friendly
with Paul McCartney and...

405
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,028
had heard this song
that he'd written called...

406
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:10,165
"World Without Love,"
which The Beatles had declined to do.

407
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:14,842
I heard it and thought that it was a song
Gordon and I could sing reasonably well.

408
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,074
So I asked Paul.

409
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:22,182
I said, "We've got this record contract.
We're going to go and cut some songs.

410
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,788
"Could you finish that song?"
It was unfinished. It didn't have a bridge.

411
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,519
And he finished it, wrote the bridge...

412
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,656
and we went and recorded it.
And fortunately it was a big hit.

413
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:30,486
It really wasn't until The Beatles
and the whole English invasion...

414
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,490
that I became just a crazed Anglophile...

415
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,755
and would pick up anything I could
about English bands...

416
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:40,161
particularly ones
that weren't even available in the States.

417
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,099
But it was always English music for me.
That was the turning point.

418
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,670
The Kinks were much more
quintessentially English.

419
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,807
I always think...

420
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,601
that Ray Davies should one day
be poet laureate.

421
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,580
You know, he invented
a new kind of poetry...

422
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,348
and a new kind of language
for pop writing...

423
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,720
which I think influenced me
from the very beginning.

424
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:11,523
The Kinks were completely crazy.
Completely.

425
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,057
They would do things like...

426
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,597
cut all the wires...

427
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:22,539
to the electricity while you were playing.
Just cut them with pliers.

428
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,770
They would throw things at you
while you were playing.

429
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,902
They were completely nuts.

430
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,574
But once you heard that
You Really Got Me...

431
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,650
you knew that they were destined
for fame and glory.

432
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,742
London was the known center
of the universe...

433
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,979
as far as the '60s were concerned.

434
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,419
I'm not saying that in a conceited manner.

435
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,686
It's where the fashion
was emanating from.

436
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,883
Politics were unfolding.

437
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,622
Carnaby Street was for the kids...

438
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:25,761
coming in on the tube to think they were
buying what Londoners were buying.

439
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,068
If Eric Clapton wore a suit...

440
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,541
with wide lapels, like a Georgian suit...

441
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,545
it very quickly appeared in Carnaby Street.

442
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,510
It really was,
all the Carnaby Street thing....

443
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,174
Fantastic clubs.

444
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,112
It's a memory that
you don't have to romanticize.

445
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,179
It was very real.

446
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:15,111
All of a sudden, kids had to have
long hair like they had in England.

447
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,381
We almost began to talk like Englishmen.

448
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,945
We wore the same clothing.

449
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:23,221
All sorts of things happened with the look
that we borrowed from England.

450
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,624
We took how we looked...

451
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,628
we took fashion and all that stuff
very seriously.

452
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,901
I remember thinking a lot
about how I would have to look.

453
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,405
The energy in London,
and the energy around the music...

454
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:49,444
and then The Stones,
there was this onward-going battle.

455
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,716
They were all down in the clubs together.

456
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,157
But it was all about,
"Where are you on the charts today?"

457
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,252
And it was all very real, you know.

458
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,957
They were pumping records out,
and they were so prolific.

459
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:07,104
Andrew Oldham was very keen that we
write songs because of obvious reasons.

460
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,162
First, we got more money.

461
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,606
One of those was As Tears Go By...

462
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:15,371
which Marianne Faithfull recorded,
and that was a quite good one.

463
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:19,343
But again, it was a song
written for a woman, more or less.

464
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,845
It became a hit because it was
a better song, she was good looking...

465
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,857
and Andrew promoted it, and so on.

466
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,793
And we promoted it because we wrote it,
by which time, we were quite well known.

467
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,660
The whole thing of it took off.

468
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,529
I did realize
that it was a very strange song...

469
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,695
for a 17-year-old to sing.

470
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,534
And, of course, it's haunted me all my life
and probably always will.

471
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,507
It took me a long time to really like it.

472
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:51,036
I couldn't until I really became
more the right age.

473
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,641
My legs were shaking.
My knees were knocking together...

474
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,650
which, of course,
was incredibly charming, I suppose...

475
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,918
for the audience to see
this beautiful little, blond...

476
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,220
angelic creature shaking with fear...

477
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,490
listening to people judging
As Tears Go By.

478
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,297
I always liked the British sound.

479
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,760
We got fearful 'cause they were
getting ready to dominate the charts.

480
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,336
It was kind of a fearful thing for Motown,
"Wow, what's going to happen?"

481
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,805
But it really didn't hurt at all.

482
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,638
It's just that they had their space
and we just had ours.

483
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,811
It was really a great compliment
to everybody...

484
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,542
that these two musics
were really dominating the charts.

485
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:02,775
There were so many Motown artists
who were all good.

486
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:07,218
It was just like a stable of talented people.

487
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,516
When I listen to some of The Supremes...

488
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,654
they are bigger than The Beatles,
as far as I am concerned...

489
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,961
but they never got that recognition.
That always bothered me.

490
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:20,169
'Cause The Supremes
were the biggest things happening.

491
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:16,887
The Spoonful was
touring the south in 1965...

492
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,895
with The Supremes.

493
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,392
The theory being...

494
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,561
both of us were going
to increase our audience base.

495
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:30,198
And we were both anxious
to share in some of the other's audience.

496
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:02,570
We provided a direct rebuttal
to the English invasion.

497
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,175
People kind of expected us...

498
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,700
to imitate The Beatles
in a lot of ways that we didn't.

499
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,848
What happened to America...

500
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,689
in this crisis of confidence
when The Beatles...

501
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,060
and Freddie and the Dreamers even
were wiping out American bands?

502
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,193
America looked at the situation,
assessed it...

503
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:35,000
and within a very short time,
by the end of '65, '66...

504
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,673
it was back in business.

505
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,562
In our neck of the woods,
they were a pretty popular band.

506
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:08,566
I never noticed a Hammond organ
in my life till I saw The Rascals.

507
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,540
Then we went and scrounged up
somebody's old Hammond organ...

508
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,235
and here's a whole other texture of sound.

509
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:21,306
People don't realize
the contribution The Rascals made.

510
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:26,318
They were the uptown band.
They had this vicious rhythm section.

511
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,914
I mean, it was popping.

512
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:32,520
Between Felix's left hand and Dino Danelli,
I mean, it was great!

513
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:38,392
There was also a tremendous
amount of competition between bands.

514
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,302
It was a very competitive thing...

515
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,738
between the East Coast
and the West Coast.

516
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,968
The Byrds were
the West Coast guys at the time.

517
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,472
We became this very free,
unstructured act onstage...

518
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,881
and did what we pleased
and built around...

519
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,022
a real song-oriented show.

520
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,186
The vocals were great.
Gene Clark was a fine lead singer.

521
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,820
And McGuinn and Crosby.

522
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,766
We were really turning
into a pretty decent band.

523
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,995
It was starting to sound real musical.

524
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,118
But we couldn't turn down
a trip to England...

525
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,492
'cause it was where The Beatles and
Stones came from.

526
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,464
We thought maybe something in the water
made you sound better.

527
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,431
We didn't know what it was,
but we wanted to go over there.

528
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,961
So we went over there,
and our unscrupulous promoter...

529
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,530
had billed us as
"America's answer to The Beatles."

530
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:56,103
I mean, The Byrds were not
in The Beatles' class ever.

531
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:02,344
We became a good band,
and we had a lot of good ideas...

532
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,286
but we were not America's answer...

533
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,324
to bug spray, let alone The Beatles.

534
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:32,343
In the early '60s the only people in LA
were The Beach Boys...

535
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,281
and a few other bands.

536
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:41,183
Once we started out there,
a lot of the bands started coming to LA.

537
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,619
It seemed like The Byrds were a catalyst...

538
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,526
for that music scene to develop
into more of an alternative area.

539
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:54,567
I was dropped on my head
when I was three years old.

540
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,004
Someone was throwing me in the air
and catching me.

541
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,770
They called his name,
and he looked away and I went....

542
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,276
So I've heard harmony ever since.

543
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,304
When I hear a melody,
I hear a harmony to it. It's strange.

544
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,907
John arranged everything
that The Mamas & The Papas ever did.

545
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:14,651
He was the vocal arranger from heaven.

546
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:20,160
I mean, he just had a great magical touch.

547
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:51,425
Creeque Alley was just a....
All of our friends who were in California...

548
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:55,090
and who were here and there, and what
they were doing and what was going on.

549
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,998
The Lovin' Spoonful and The Byrds.

550
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:10,945
Michelle was the very first runaway
in California.

551
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:16,309
She was the atypical California girl
that Brian Wilson wrote a song about.

552
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:20,623
California Girls. And she was
absolutely, ravishingly beautiful...

553
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:25,554
and had long blond hair,
and didn't wear shoes, and had beads...

554
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,961
and had run away,
and she was 16 years old.

555
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,798
A real delight.

556
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,989
Denny had one of the most beautiful
voices I had ever heard.

557
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,398
So Denny and Michelle...

558
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,959
and I started singing together.

559
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,238
We started to sing as a trio.

560
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:20,243
And everywhere we went,
he was always on the phone...

561
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,485
with this girl that he was talking to.

562
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,580
Constantly. Everywhere we went.
Every city we went to.

563
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,353
He was on the phone
with this girl named Cass.

564
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,327
And we said, "So who is this chick?
Is she your girlfriend?"

565
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:45,004
We decided that we were going
to really keep everything in the song...

566
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,407
factual.

567
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,242
We weren't going
to take any liberties, you know.

568
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,415
John is a very clever writer, you know.

569
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,544
And the whole song was completed
in about three hours.

570
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:17,769
From LA to London, Rock was now
a truly international phenomenon.

571
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:22,735
And back in England, new bands
were busy developing a cocky edge.

572
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,982
They were led by The Who
and Pete Townshend...

573
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,541
who made a ritual out of demolishing
his electric guitar on stage.

574
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,725
You have to remember
that The Who broke a full year and a half...

575
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,285
after The Stones and The Beatles
had broken, maybe more than that.

576
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,297
By that time,
we were allowed to be angry.

577
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,598
You know, The Stones and The Beatles
had broken enough rules.

578
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,570
So our anger wasn't all our own anger.

579
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,542
Our anger was a reflection of the anger
that we felt from people in the audience.

580
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:42,088
I think I wrote it as a series of songs...

581
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,653
about my inability to express...

582
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,595
what I felt to women.

583
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,965
A couple of kids came up and said,
"You know, that was great. "

584
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:58,067
And I said, "It's just about some kid
who can't explain what he thinks."

585
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,803
And they said, "That's it! That's us! "

586
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,675
That was really when I realized...

587
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:07,444
that I'd been voted in as spokesman
for that bunch of kids.

588
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,578
Most of the scene
was actually happening in London.

589
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,517
There was a kind of an invisible line...

590
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,422
that went from just north of London
to the rest of England.

591
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,624
It wasn't until The Beatles broke through
and became very successful...

592
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,463
that it changed all that geographically.

593
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,806
We came up with Carrie-Anne.
That was originally Marianne.

594
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:33,638
We actually wrote it
about Marianne Faithfull...

595
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,770
but didn't have the guts
to call it "Marianne."

596
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:40,305
So we called it "Carrie-Anne,"
a made-up name we'd never heard of.

597
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:15,941
I must say, when it came out,
I wondered if it was written for me.

598
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,723
But I sort of brushed it aside,
like I always have done really.

599
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,725
"No, of course it wouldn't have been."

600
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,197
The bands for me that meant a lot...

601
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,331
primarily The Beatles
without question, above all...

602
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,509
The Kinks and the Small Faces...

603
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,346
and somewhere behind them
other groups like...

604
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,946
The Spencer Davis Group.

605
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,643
Steve Winwood was now known
as this child prodigy...

606
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,706
a title that he didn't take to very kindly,
I can assure you.

607
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,014
He didn't like it.
He wanted to be a musician.

608
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,747
He wanted to be one of the boys.

609
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:59,487
In March of 1966, John Lennon made
an off-the-cuff remark...

610
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,057
suggesting that The Beatles
were bigger than Jesus.

611
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,784
His comments caused an uproar.

612
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,623
In America 's conservative Bible belt...

613
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,928
records were burned
and protests organized.

614
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,564
I think John's remark about Jesus Christ...

615
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:16,504
obviously was a stupid thing to do.

616
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,534
I don't think he meant it
the way it was interpreted.

617
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,134
He didn't mean to say,
"Hey, we are bigger than Jesus."

618
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,237
What he meant to say was that Jesus...

619
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,875
or rather Christianity didn't seem to be
as popular as The Beatles.

620
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,750
The burning of Beatles records...

621
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,780
and the general anti-Beatle element
that arose...

622
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:38,094
was very disturbing.
It was pretty rough stuff.

623
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,325
And as you know...

624
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:44,830
John actually made an apology
saying that he didn't mean it that way...

625
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:48,200
but if he did upset people,
he was really sorry about it.

626
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:52,806
I am not saying that we are better,
or greater, or comparing us with...

627
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:57,279
Jesus Christ as a person,
or God as a thing, whatever it is.

628
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:00,914
I just said what I said, and it was wrong,
or was taken wrong...

629
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,451
and now it's all this.

630
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:07,023
Fame, if you have too much of it,
is a pretty heavy penance.

631
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,248
And it got very wearing.

632
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,590
It was in danger of destroying their lives.

633
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:14,160
So it was difficult for them
to cope with that.

634
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,892
That was one of the reasons why they
wanted to relax into the studio more.

635
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,103
The Beatles came, and the whole
English invasion behind that.

636
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,907
And suddenly here was something
that was of my own generation.

637
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,003
Because it was a strange thing...

638
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,915
to soak up the '50s music at the age of 12,
when it was really all over.

639
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,511
It was just great.

640
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:41,819
Exciting, fresh, and interesting. They're
very good, really musical and funny.

641
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,494
What can you say about The Beatles?

642
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,928
They really transformed popular music.

643
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:52,433
Something that I guess
we've taken from The Beatles...

644
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,400
is the thing of never trying
to repeat yourself.

645
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,201
Always keep moving.

646
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:01,340
These four guys from Liverpool
were stealing a march on us.

647
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,739
It was a slap.
It was a brawler for a while...

648
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,282
especially since they were successful...

649
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,151
and we weren't.

650
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,087
But we met them real early.
They heard about us and came to see us...

651
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,222
one night in some club.

652
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:25,592
Suddenly they were regular guys,
we started talking guitars and songs.

653
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:29,537
Because at that time Mick and I
hadn't considered writing songs.

654
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:33,133
In fact, if it wasn't for The Beatles,
we probably never would have.

655
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,550
The British invasion
had the biggest impact on me.

656
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,052
Stuff that was coming out of England...

657
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,920
The Animals and The Stones
and The Beatles.

658
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,017
Then I went back and discovered...

659
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,860
a lot of the blues roots and soul roots,
and the original records.

1
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,219
Soul is sometimes defined
as the essence of the human spirit.

2
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,550
In the popular music of the 1960s,
soul meant something more tangible.

3
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,025
It was a shout of joy, a cry of pain...

4
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,758
and an emblem
of uninhibited self-expression.

5
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,479
I describe soul music as something that
touches me and gives me goose bumps.

6
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:24,449
And it could be a white person singing it,
or a black person, or a purple person.

7
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,543
I don't care who's singing it
as long as you can lift my spirit.

8
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,488
Everything we did live
came from out of soul music.

9
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,390
The spiritual intensity...

10
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,624
the idea of going for...

11
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,327
both your spirit and your gut.

12
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,460
You're talking to somebody
who's a music buff...

13
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,723
especially when it comes to black music.

14
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,823
Say it Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud
by James Brown...

15
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,970
Isley Brothers, It's Your Thing.

16
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,006
I mean, I could go on and on.

17
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,542
There's this thing about soul...

18
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,240
you know, of abandoning yourself
to the songs.

19
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,281
The normal definition for it would be...

20
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,980
it's black music or black people
singing music, or what have you...

21
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,755
but I don't agree with that...

22
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,156
because I think that
everybody has their own soul...

23
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,956
and I've heard the same song
by 10 different people...

24
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,690
and their soul was applied to it.

25
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,135
If you feel music intensely...

26
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,110
and you express it that way honestly...

27
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,543
then it's soul.

28
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,581
It's tied a lot to, I think...

29
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,649
gospel music.
I think it's secular gospel music.

30
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,246
Gospel music is really...

31
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,923
let's say, the bedmate...

32
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,918
to R & B music.

33
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,456
I remember
Mount Moriah Baptist Church...

34
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,432
and the support that the people gave us.

35
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,025
When we became
Gladys Knight and the Pips...

36
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,171
I was just turning eight then.

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,870
But we had our little church group...

38
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,840
before we had Gladys Knight and the Pips.

39
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,004
So it being my brother and sister
and my cousins...

40
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,777
we all went to the same church.

41
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,582
So when we formed the group, that was
the same group that went down...

42
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,453
to the Royal Peacock
to perform on Sunday nights.

43
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,987
And the church would just migrate
from Mount Moriah to the Royal Peacock.

44
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,024
It's amazing, back there like....

45
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,152
And then they had that, you know,
that holler, you know....

46
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,687
And I loved that.

47
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,691
They were screaming,
and I said, "My Lord! "

48
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,954
I guess your music...

49
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,160
I mean, what's in your body...

50
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,167
I mean, what's in your soul
or the way you came up...

51
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,759
somehow or another will come out...

52
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,704
through your fingers or come out
through your vocal chords or whatever.

53
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,932
Everyone who influenced me...

54
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,171
and everyone who I just idolized...

55
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,770
was a gospel singer:

56
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,816
Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin...

57
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,879
Tina Turner, Patti LaBelle...

58
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,148
they were all great gospel singers first.

59
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,714
This is a song that could be done
as soulful and gospel....

60
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,461
Maybe. Let me see.
Let me see how to do it.

61
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,795
If you ask me to

62
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,391
I just might change my mind

63
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,663
And let you in my life forever

64
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,174
Now, that might be soulful. Now, gospel.

65
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,638
If you ask me to

66
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,843
I just might change my mind

67
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:56,911
And let you in my life forever

68
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,581
Yeah, that's it.

69
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,090
Soul is synonymous with great voices
and great entertainers.

70
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,898
Each one unforgettable.

71
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,550
Soul music is....

72
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,354
Soul music is....

73
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,351
It's just soulful.

74
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,417
-Gratifying.
-How would I put it?

75
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,258
It's a feeling that you have to have.

76
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,627
It's not prim and proper.

77
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,131
It's funky.

78
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,599
James Brown.

79
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,653
"I got ants in my pants
and I need to dance.

80
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,420
"Some big fine mama,
come give me a chance."

81
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,765
that's the funkiest man in the entire world.

82
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,414
He creates some of the most creative...

83
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:07,249
revolutionized rhythms
for his time and funk.

84
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,448
I mean, he's an originator. He's an original.

85
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,573
I remember, first time I had a chance
to go see James Brown was....

86
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,408
The line was so long,
but I didn't mind standing in that line.

87
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,503
Just to get in there to see him.

88
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,841
Stayed in there to see three shows
because he had some bands that just...

89
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,443
put people in frenzies.

90
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,490
James Brown's influence
was one of the most powerful.

91
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,516
I mean, it's evident in the groups
that can halfway dance, you know.

92
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,856
It's attitude.

93
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,938
He's gonna scream. He's gonna yell.
He's gonna split. He's gonna dance.

94
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,534
And when he says,
"One, two, three, four. Hit it..."

95
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,172
he's giving the MCs
something to get ill on.

96
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:14,119
James Brown is a master.
There's one James Brown.

97
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,847
The things that he has achieved has
opened the doors for many black artists.

98
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,223
There'll never be another James Brown.

99
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,436
James Brown's stagecraft
set a new standard...

100
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,063
but from the late '50s into the '70s
he had plenty of competition.

101
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,635
From the grittiest of blues stylists
to the most sublime of gospel balladeers.

102
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,362
Sam Cooke was very important
in the development of rock 'n' roll.

103
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,773
I first heard Sam Cooke
singing gospel music...

104
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,834
when he used to sing
with the Soul Stirrers...

105
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,607
and that's when I was a kid.

106
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,307
So he was one of my major influences.

107
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,717
From childhood, he was always talented.

108
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,155
That was truly a gift of God.

109
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,756
I mean, he had a voice
that was mesmerizing.

110
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,481
He was one of the very first black people
to play the Copacabana...

111
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,541
and make this grand splash, you know.

112
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,850
And he had this big billboard
on Broadway.

113
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:01,551
I mean, he did it like it was....
I mean, first-class. Go, Sam.

114
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,318
He used to always say music is simplicity.

115
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,188
He said people would buy the news
if you sung it with a melody.

116
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,387
Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson...

117
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,285
were rivals in the industry.

118
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,052
But they were good friends.

119
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:43,658
After they'd leave the stage,
Sam and Jackie would hang out together.

120
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,934
They were very good friends.

121
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:00,517
One of the most interesting people
we ever introduced is Jackie Wilson...

122
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,149
who had an untrained
operatic style delivery...

123
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,056
but who was a gymnast
and a former boxer.

124
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,060
Take that conglomeration,
put it together...

125
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,154
what a magnificent entertainer.
They called him Mr. Excitement.

126
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,789
He was just a great performer.

127
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,927
You talk about Michael Jackson spinning?
You should see Jackie Wilson spin.

128
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,847
He would fight at the drop of a hat.

129
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,814
We played at New Orleans once...

130
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,114
when they had a segregated audience...

131
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,713
and the black people sat on one side
of the stage...

132
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,453
and the white people
were on the other side of the stage.

133
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,827
And performers got whiplash trying not to
insult anybody while they performed.

134
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,331
And some big cracker policeman...

135
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,893
said something to Jackie
and he popped him.

136
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,833
They almost killed him.

137
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:00,511
But, I mean, that was the kind of person
you were dealing with, with Jackie.

138
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,343
His temper was as great as his talent.

139
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,591
That late '60s-R&B-type music...

140
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,326
was probably
some of the best music we've turned out...

141
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,890
as an industry.

142
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,897
Each sound, each city had its own identity.

143
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,599
The sound could never be duplicated
from Philadelphia.

144
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,802
The sound could never be duplicated
from Detroit.

145
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,846
The sound could never be duplicated
from Memphis.

146
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:39,180
The sound could never be duplicated
from Atlantic Records.

147
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:43,347
We always went for a very strong bottom,
very pronounced bass...

148
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,357
a good, rounded bass sound,
strong bass drum.

149
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,155
In other words, clean funk.

150
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,797
Jerry Wexler's always been
a huge supporter of black music.

151
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:02,030
And Atlantic began its career
in black music.

152
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:45,516
Ray Charles was
the Michael Jordan of music.

153
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:50,846
Ray could do anything and everything
and make it believable.

154
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,984
He was walking up the stairway
and out to the exit...

155
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,891
and I just happened to be there...

156
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:01,023
and I touched his shoulder and it was....
I thought I'd touched the Lord.

157
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,438
I have a very personal reason
for loving Ray like I do.

158
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,484
Not only for the fact of his talent...

159
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,520
because he is
one of the most talented people ever....

160
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:27,317
But the very first professional gig
that I ever played in my life...

161
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,386
was we played the Ray Charles show
at the Apollo theater in New York.

162
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,987
We'd never played a show like that...

163
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,966
so we didn't realize we needed
professional band arrangements.

164
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,161
We didn't have them.

165
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,228
We had what we call onion skins,
or lead sheets.

166
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,570
He sat there and did an arrangement...

167
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,439
to both of our songs
that we were singing on that show...

168
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,479
just dry. Just like that.

169
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,275
I love Ray Charles.

170
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,684
He's like that vintage bottle of wine.

171
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,912
He's an antique.

172
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,587
He is just too good to be true.

173
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:13,000
Soul music to me is something that....

174
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,539
It portrays what you are...

175
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:22,370
and it digs.
It can go as deep as you allow it to go.

176
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,808
And then it releases you.

177
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,649
And you feel great.

178
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,384
That soul music is good for the soul.

179
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,691
There was so much soul music then.
Great soul music.

180
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,232
Wilson Pickett was just amazing.

181
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,026
Well, Wilson, you know,
his reputation precedes him...

182
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,757
and that's why they call him
"the Wicked Mr. Pickett. "

183
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,995
I had been listening to some of the stuff
that he had sang on...

184
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,061
and almost invariably,
on these gospel things...

185
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:24,132
he would go into this "I'm gonna wait
till the midnight hour to see my Jesus."

186
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,574
He would go into this chant...

187
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,977
and it sort of, to me,
was like an identity for him.

188
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,008
Wilson was a crazy man.

189
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,081
I loved him.

190
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,852
Wilson was the king of funk.

191
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,936
Wilson was a fantastic singer,
entertainer, too, you know.

192
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,684
Most of these artists
you're talking about are unique.

193
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,688
They were the Memphis sound.

194
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,491
They represented
that area of the country...

195
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,759
that produced that music.

196
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,633
That old era of Stax, with that
soulful music that came from Memphis.

197
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,646
We were in a very large room.

198
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,555
We were in a movie theater...

199
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,890
which was not a giant theater,
but it was a pretty good-sized theater.

200
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,366
I've had a lot of musicologists
and a lot of musicians...

201
00:18:55,434 --> 00:19:00,167
refer to the Stax records
of having this incredible delayed backbeat.

202
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,337
And a lot of that really came by accident.

203
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,189
The first time I heard Otis Redding...

204
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:22,250
I was driving through
some Southern city...

205
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:27,196
and we were listening to WLAC,
a big radio station, 50,000 watts...

206
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,461
that came out of Nashville, Tennessee.

207
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,904
And I heard this man
who was just moaning and groaning...

208
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,430
These arms of mine

209
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,204
as only he could do.

210
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,714
And I said, "What is this guy doing?
What is this sound?"

211
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,795
I watched him
and knew he was going to be a star.

212
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,635
I've never seen a man master a stage
so fast in my life.

213
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,334
He made me learn
how to master a stage after watching him.

214
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,208
Soul music is, I think,
almost a state of mind.

215
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,719
And you express that state of mind...

216
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,412
very emotionally.

217
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,621
My concept of it is...

218
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,958
it is music that comes from the heart.

219
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,963
It might just be one word
you want to bring across...

220
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,500
a certain way to put across your point.

221
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,398
And I think that's what the soul is.

222
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,462
It's outside of some other music
that is very structured.

223
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,235
You can take some structured singers...

224
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,106
that became soul singers,
they took the structure out of it.

225
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,274
They base it on structure, but then
they just do what they feel impulsively.

226
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,055
Aretha Franklin...

227
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,385
as evidenced by how many people
refer to her today...

228
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,159
is the living encyclopedia...

229
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,897
of soul music.

230
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,074
Look at how many people
borrow from and emulate...

231
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,845
and idolize what she contributed.

232
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,580
Her voice is just effortless.

233
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:34,251
She doesn't even have to try, you know.
It just comes out. She's blessed.

234
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,884
She's definitely blessed.

235
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,987
And I remember her songs
around my house a lot.

236
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,733
As far as how to record her, we just
kept doing what we had been doing...

237
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,301
with our rhythm and blues artists...

238
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,075
to let this sound emerge and be heard.

239
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,812
And not try to make it palatable
to a white audience.

240
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,586
The idea was to record her
with great musicians...

241
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,117
and put her at the piano,
and let her sing and play for herself.

242
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,296
One of the reasons for some of the hits...

243
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:28,344
at Atlantic was my gospel background...

244
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:33,350
being merged with
the popular or R & B stylings.

245
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,645
Aretha, gospel, and soul:
totally synonymous.

246
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,611
I think you look back and you look at...

247
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,073
all the performers that came before you...

248
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,278
and they make their own maps,
you know...

249
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,287
and they leave them for you...

250
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,586
if you care to read them.

251
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,692
There's an art to it,
and those guys were the masters.

252
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,220
All the soul greats,
they were the masters at it.

253
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,289
Then you've got quite a few others...

254
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,564
but those legends show you how to do it.

255
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,199
Apart from its gospel and blues heritage...

256
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:33,040
soul had tangled roots in the world
of independent record companies...

257
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,308
which created music
for a segregated audience.

258
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,007
They were called
at that time "race records. "

259
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,420
And it would have the word "race"
on the record.

260
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,853
The strong ones were...

261
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,327
black artists coming through
the independent record companies.

262
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:56,265
At that time,
the music was being controlled by....

263
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,834
Chess, Checker, and Argo record company.

264
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,497
Atlantic record company.

265
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,940
Companies like that,
that were smart enough...

266
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,546
to sign up black artists...

267
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,416
and merchandise and market
these black artists.

268
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,413
And these entrepreneurs
would get in their car...

269
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,754
and go down South...

270
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,989
and sell the records themselves because
no record shop would take these records.

271
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,360
So it became soul music...

272
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,923
and black people
were supposed to be the ones doing it.

273
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,333
And then it got to be so good...

274
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,363
then everybody else
wanted to adopt soul music.

275
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,505
When we recorded Little Latin Lupe Lu...

276
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,913
the white stations wouldn't play it
because they quote....

277
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,217
The quote was that it was "too hard rock".

278
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:54,318
What it was, is it just sounded too black
for their white stations.

279
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,690
Now, we didn't know that at the time...

280
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:00,322
but the one thing
that we're most proud of...

281
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:06,065
is that the black audience accepted us...

282
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,167
just point-blank. And they didn't have to.

283
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,176
They just flat didn't have to...

284
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:16,340
but the great thing
about the black audience...

285
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,508
is that if you are emotionally cutting it...

286
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,345
that's what it's all about.

287
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,915
There were, in those days, four theaters
that you were required to play...

288
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,430
to prove that you had sort of made it.

289
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:37,927
They were called the Litchman chain,
and it consisted of:

290
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,561
the Regal theater in Chicago...

291
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,296
the Howard in Washington.

292
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,303
There was the Uptown in Philadelphia....

293
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,469
And the Apollo in New York City.

294
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,637
You had to play those four theaters.

295
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,126
On stage at the Apollo Theater...

296
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,131
three generations
of soul singers reminisced.

297
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,961
It was the only really black theater that....

298
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,302
This was like Broadway....
I mean, this was like heaven.

299
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:19,673
To young artists,
this was hallowed ground.

300
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,880
Every great entertainer had been here.

301
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,974
Like your Otis Reddings
and your James Browns.

302
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,118
You got a chance
to become friends with them...

303
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,779
and talk with them...

304
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:34,757
and they give you little tidbits
on what you should do.

305
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:39,456
So you not only got educated
about show business here...

306
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,160
you got educated about the world
and about how people are.

307
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,785
The Apollo Theater
and the theater circuit...

308
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:04,686
and the different clubs
that we used to play...

309
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,452
that people considered
part of the chitlin circuit...

310
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,220
it was our playground.

311
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,627
It was where we learned our craft.

312
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,622
The importance of the Apollo....
It just means so much to so many people.

313
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,636
It could have been some place in Peoria,
but it's not.

314
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:24,368
It happened to be in New York City
and that's where a lot of things happened.

315
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,242
And there are so many great artists
that came out of that area...

316
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,644
and off of that stage.

317
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,816
I remember having to
put my hot dogs on the light bulb.

318
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,586
We had five shows a day...

319
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,713
and that was my breakfast, lunch,
and dinner...

320
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,122
because we would play cards
with Tommy Hunt...

321
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,491
and maybe The Dells and The Spinners....
I don't know who else.

322
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,757
Dionne Warwick, whoever....

323
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,527
But they would always take my money.
They would always win.

324
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,462
One of the things I remember the most
about the Apollo...

325
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:56,132
is the first time we walked in there,
they had a mural on the foyer wall.

326
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,368
Harry Belafonte, Sammy Davis...

327
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:02,511
Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan,
Billy Eckstine....

328
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,810
All these people were on that mural.

329
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,475
For me, those were the glory days.

330
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:10,078
I mean, I got to see
one of those magic Apollo Nights...

331
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,291
with James Brown and Otis Redding
on the same bill.

332
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,491
And this is my Oscar, you know.

333
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,827
These are my Oscars.
These are my memories.

334
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,891
These are more precious to me...

335
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:29,065
than any recording contract or...

336
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,908
an award that I could receive...

337
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:36,276
because they were mine,
and I still keep them inside.

338
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,510
The range of the chitlin circuit mirrored
the scope...

339
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:47,615
of the music pouring out of the studios
from the East Coast to the Midwest.

340
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,661
In Detroit, Motown reigned supreme.

341
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,164
The songs were really songs...

342
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,466
that reached all across the world...

343
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:05,168
and they reached people
probably at that time...

344
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,009
when Motown just opened up the doors
to everybody.

345
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,211
See, I was a big Motown child.

346
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,343
I was a heavily influenced Motown child.

347
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,283
For me, it was...

348
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,052
whatever the Beatles meant
to those screaming teenagers...

349
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,889
Motown meant to me.

350
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:27,330
I don't know if they were listening to us,
but we were certainly listening to them.

351
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,424
I don't think we were trying to copy them
by any means...

352
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,598
but you couldn't turn on the radio
without hearing a Motown record.

353
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,017
What made Motown Motown
was Berry Gordy...

354
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:56,717
who is one of the most unique people,
I'm sure, to ever be on this planet.

355
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,891
And to have him at the helm
of what was going on...

356
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,927
was just the most wonderful thing...

357
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,339
for a music-making young person...

358
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:15,735
who had access to Detroit at that time.

359
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,487
We first knew him as a songwriter.

360
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:29,516
In fact, when he started Motown....
When he started this record company...

361
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,152
whatever he was going to name it....

362
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,720
He asked us would we go with him
to that company.

363
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,358
We just said no,
because we didn't think he had a chance.

364
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,731
We said "absolutely not."

365
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,396
Black guy with a tape recorder
starting a record company.

366
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,802
Yes, right. Okay.

367
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,430
The first one is so magical.

368
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,265
Because you can see
all your dreams come true.

369
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,737
Just, "Yes! It's here! "

370
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,797
Berry had a vision.

371
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,571
He had a real good, solid sense...

372
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,137
of vision, and imagination,
and organization.

373
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,618
He knew how to put it together
so that he could end up with something...

374
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,917
that ended up being what they call
"The sounds of young America."

375
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,457
And it was very different.

376
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,668
The reason we started Motown
was because nobody was paying us.

377
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:53,366
Berry would produce our records
in the early days...

378
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,310
and put them out to other companies,
and nobody really paid us.

379
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:06,517
"Man, this record is so big.
I don't know what to do with it...

380
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:11,085
"because I don't know who to put it with
because nobody's been paying us."

381
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,691
So I said, "Why don't you just
go national with it, man?"

382
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,992
He said, "What?"

383
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,933
I said, "Why don't you
go national with it?"

384
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,971
He said,
"But I'm not set up to go national."

385
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,064
I said, "You can be.
Nobody's paying us anyway.

386
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,507
"If we lose money,
we lose money for ourselves.

387
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,976
"Why don't you just go?" So he did.

388
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,379
We came out with
Please Mr. Postman. Smash!

389
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,576
Right on the heels of Please Mr. Postman...

390
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,746
we came up with Shop Around,
which was just....

391
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,547
So that's how it happened.

392
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,863
The real Smokey that I love
is the songwriter Smokey...

393
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,837
the Smokey who writes lyrics...

394
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,965
like Tracks of My Tears...

395
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,834
and "Ooo baby baby,
I'm just about at the end of my rope...

396
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,074
"but I can't stop trying,
I can't give up hope."

397
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,673
Come on, please.
That says it all, you know?

398
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,496
Ooo Baby Baby was a song...

399
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,399
that actually started live on stage.

400
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,102
We.... When I say we,
I mean the Miracles and me...

401
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,506
Ooo baby baby

402
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,469
I started singing it,
the guys fell in in the harmony...

403
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,810
started singing, "Ooo baby baby."

404
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,782
The people went crazy.

405
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,110
So we said,
"Man, people like that so much...

406
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,623
So we came home, finished up the song...

407
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,321
went to the studio,
recorded Ooo Baby Baby.

408
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,626
And that's where it came from.

409
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,675
We could go on a 51-nighter tour.

410
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,577
And as soon as you got home...

411
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,644
and took a bath
or whatever you wanted to do...

412
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,018
and got yourself together,
you went to Hitsville.

413
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,949
Why? Because everybody
was gonna be there.

414
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,850
We'd pull up in front of the house
on the first day....

415
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,988
We got in '62, I think, it was.

416
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,466
And we watched Supremes, or the Temps.

417
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,167
Little Stevie would be there.

418
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,534
You could hear him upstairs
playing on the drums...

419
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,266
and blowing his little harp.

420
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,274
Marvin Gaye might be pulling up...

421
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,641
and he's talking to his wife, Anna,
who's Berry's sister.

422
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:45,170
The Temptations
would probably be down in the studio...

423
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,511
recording at this time.

424
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,711
Holland-Dozier-Holland
is in a room writing.

425
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,687
Meanwhile, you just walk up
and notice something for you to do.

426
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,247
Or you just come to see
what everybody else is doing.

427
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,590
It was really like a meeting place
at that time...

428
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,187
because it exploded.
I mean, things were happening.

429
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,722
The Supremes were
the number one group in the country...

430
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,031
Temptations were having their hit...

431
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,538
the Four Tops,
we'd just had Baby, I need Your Loving.

432
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,336
The excitement was just all in the air.

433
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:16,438
And every day almost, you could see
somebody else's dream come true.

434
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,533
The most important thing in the world...

435
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,905
that could happen in my teenage years...

436
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,501
was when the Supremes
made their next appearance.

437
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,138
It was like news
throughout the neighborhood.

438
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,283
All their songs were so great.

439
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,415
When I listen to some of the Supremes,
like their catalog...

440
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,959
those girls had songs up the yin-yang.

441
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,325
I said, "How many songs
have you girls got?"

442
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,920
Not "have," but "got."

443
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,092
I mean, they had more songs
than they should have.

444
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,136
They should have gave me two of them.

445
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:25,077
Our acts were groomed
from the very first signing.

446
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,047
See, every act inspired the other acts...

447
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,679
because every act wanted to be good...

448
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,246
because the Motown acts
were trained to be good.

449
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:37,219
They were immaculate, most of the people
that you're talking about.

450
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:41,459
These people here were, like, tailor-made.
I mean, they were immaculate.

451
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,764
Very colorful, very well-groomed.

452
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:50,339
The Temptations were the best of that era.

453
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,667
I used to call them....

454
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,975
My pet name for them
was The Five Deacons...

455
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:34,984
because they had this church harmony,
and they were just awesome.

456
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:39,580
I mean, with Melvin way down
on the bottom...

457
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,990
and Eddie way up on the top...

458
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,323
and all the harmonic sounds
in between them....

459
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,693
Those brothers could blow.

460
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,810
I wrote My Girl probably
in about 10, 20 minutes.

461
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,045
And every time in between the shows
at the Apollo...

462
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,611
while the movie was playing...

463
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,419
I would take the Temptations
downstairs on the stage...

464
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,982
and we would work on My Girl.

465
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,723
I would always let the Temptations
make up their own backgrounds...

466
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,822
because they were masters at it.

467
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,424
They would be doing stuff
that I would never think of...

468
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,470
for background vocals....

469
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,266
All that, you know?

470
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,603
So I always let them
make up their own backgrounds.

471
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,906
And then when we got home,
I recorded it on them.

472
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,243
And it's one of those songs
that has just lived on and on...

473
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,475
and I'm very proud of it.

474
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,841
I idolized the Temptations
because I was a street corner singer...

475
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,149
and these guys were
the ultimate singing group.

476
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:48,552
I think one of the most amazing days
of my life was spent here...

477
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,652
and that was in June of 1985.

478
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,529
I was asked to be
part of the reopening festivities here...

479
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,501
and I was honored to be asked to do that...

480
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,596
and I wanted to bring something into it
that was a part of my beginnings...

481
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:08,168
so I asked Eddie Kendricks
and David Ruffin to join John and myself.

482
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,275
It was one of those moments...

483
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,579
where the past, the present,
the future all come together.

484
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,778
The Motown sound
was a 24-hour-a-day thing...

485
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,575
that people tried to develop
and it was made out of love...

486
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:18,910
to help each other win.

487
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,147
They would cut five different tracks...

488
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,817
with five different producers...

489
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,155
and then they would come in
with five different sets of songwriters...

490
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,753
and six different lyric writers
or whatever...

491
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,527
and then they would cut it
with three, four, or five different artists.

492
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,443
Berry was smart enough to realize...

493
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,647
that that music had an appeal
beyond the black community.

494
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,808
It would be better if everybody liked it.

495
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:57,445
So he didn't make it colorless,
it was truly black music...

496
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,785
but it appealed to everybody
all over the world.

497
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,374
You know, Marvin was a unique talent.

498
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,885
We would go by the studio...

499
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,514
you could almost depend on
Marvin being there...

500
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,491
or being somewhere creating something.

501
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:41,726
And because he was such a giver,
it made the people around him...

502
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,233
want to be of that spirit, too.

503
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,256
When we first started Motown,
we had five employees...

504
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:18,165
and he said, "We're going to make music
with a great beat...

505
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,262
"with some great stories."

506
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,740
And that's what we did.

507
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:29,068
We made music with a great beat,
with some great stories.

508
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:33,611
He said, "Our stories are going to be such
that anybody can listen to them.

509
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,811
"They will not be offensive.

510
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,148
"And we're just going to make music."

511
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,357
Eventually, he adopted the slogan,
"The sound of young America"...

512
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,224
'cause that's what we were.

513
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,602
The Jackson Five was the first people
that I could relate to.

514
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,164
Those are young black kids
doing something that I like to do.

515
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:35,009
I used to kiss the TV
when Michael came on.

516
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,411
Please, I used to love Michael Jackson.

517
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,845
In the Jackson Five,
I really liked Randy at the time.

518
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,410
I mean, I loved Michael,
but I was after Randy.

519
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,218
Everybody had their own one,
you know, that....

520
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,658
Because the older girls liked Jermaine.
I think Michael....

521
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,664
Randy was around our age.
I think Michael was a little older.

522
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,895
But everybody had their own.
Michael was mine.

523
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,300
Oh, my God! I used to kiss the television.

524
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,442
To this very day, and on and on...

525
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,045
Motown will have the songs...

526
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,990
that people will want to continue
to record...

527
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,856
and do over and over.

528
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,271
The only music I ever heard as a kid
was street music, R & B music....

529
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,335
Not so much the blues.
And church music. I sang in church.

530
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,904
Came out of the Philadelphia sound.

531
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,673
It's like the Motown sound, I guess.

532
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,844
Philadelphia, we're very special
by having our own sound.

533
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,367
I was looking for those special talents...

534
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,771
coming out of the urban community.

535
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,941
My first move was to make a deal
with Gamble and Huff...

536
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,911
who were the great producers of the era.

537
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,507
I think the Philly sound...

538
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:25,719
was an extension of our experiences
in Philadelphia.

539
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,092
It was a little bit of jazz,
a little bit of gospel...

540
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,060
a little classical....

541
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,825
and when me and Huff got together,
that was it.

542
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,594
It was like...

543
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,231
it was meant to be.

544
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,546
When we wrote for the O'Jays...

545
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:02,922
I would think about how dynamic
Eddie Levert and Walter were...

546
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,260
and also William.

547
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:18,038
We couldn't wait till the O'Jays
got to town so we could rehearse.

548
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:22,704
It was like a certain anxiety there
that was, like, indescribable.

549
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:30,449
Kenny and Leon had an innate ability...

550
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,019
to write about what was going on.

551
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,242
I think Gamble and Huff...

552
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:04,448
are the premier message writers.

553
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:09,185
Mr. Gamble is a genius, absolute genius...

554
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,223
at bringing forth...

555
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,926
situations and talking about situations
that exist.

556
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:22,037
We, on purpose, tried to put
different messages in the music...

557
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:25,074
that were relative to that particular time...

558
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,939
but we weren't the first ones to do that.

559
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,241
As a matter of fact,
I like to tell people, oftentimes...

560
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,646
that Curtis Mayfield's songs...

561
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,978
kind of ushered in
the Civil Rights Movement.

562
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:21,789
We were tired as hell.
We weren't going to take it anymore.

563
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:24,629
As Prince says, "The sign of the times."

564
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,496
The times were reflected in the music.

565
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:52,155
I think, in part,
the music affected the movement...

566
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,787
and the movement affected the music.

567
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,094
However, from my perspective...

568
00:48:56,166 --> 00:49:00,159
and the view from my particular bridge,
it makes me want to say...

569
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,228
that the music affected
the movement more.

570
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,555
Free at last, free at last.

571
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,896
Thank God almighty, we are free at last.

572
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:43,805
In the 60s...

573
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,075
when James Brown came out
with his rendition...

574
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,414
of I'm Black and I'm Proud,
I think it was something that was needed.

575
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,217
Because the country
was setting new standards at that time...

576
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,224
and, of course, you know, it was....

577
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:58,284
We were trying to gain equality
for our people.

578
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:02,298
So James Brown has made
a great contribution to all of that...

579
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,156
with soul music.

580
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,996
There was a message then.
There's a message now.

581
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,404
The message is probably a little more
in-your-face type of message...

582
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:14,774
like that reminds me of Run-D.M.C.'s...

583
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,478
I'm proud to be black, y'all
and that's a fact, y'all

584
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,516
You know, it's the same type of thing.

585
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,417
So once again,
the same way that you get...

586
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,182
samples from those songs...

587
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,315
you also can listen
to what they were saying...

588
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:31,452
and it can influence you.
That music can influence you.

589
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,295
I think just the nature of black music
makes it...

590
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,830
almost like cell division.

591
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:48,105
It just constantly grows
and builds off of itself.

592
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,049
The golden age of soul was the 1960s.

593
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,191
But the sounds of that era still echo...

594
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:05,194
in the music and popular culture
of America today.

595
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,011
The emotion, the artistry, the runs...

596
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,817
I think that is what creates soul.

597
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,600
You know, when people ask me...

598
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:52,205
why the music is still around....

599
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,438
I've been doing it
for 35 years professionally.

600
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,538
It was here when I came.

601
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,945
It will be here when I leave.

602
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:08,717
Because the messages and the melodies...

603
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:16,063
are infinite.

604
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,949
All of the movies that we go to see...

605
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,584
you look at TV shows like China Beach...

606
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,527
and there's Diana Ross and the Supremes
singing Reflections.

607
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,724
You know, you listen to songs...

608
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,762
by acts in other musical genres...

609
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,567
by rock 'n' roll acts,
by just other acts who are successful...

610
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,633
and they all pay homage
to R & B and soul music...

611
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,803
of the '60s, '50s, and '70s.

612
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:07,511
I think that soul music is around,
is going to be around...

613
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,280
because it's the essence...

614
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,813
it's the life of the music industry
soul music.

615
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:19,158
Soul music never loses time...

616
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:23,090
and it's always timely.

617
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,269
It can't be outdated...

618
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,828
and it's never going to be old hat.

619
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,569
Soul music is just like
something that haunts you...

620
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:36,544
and that will be with you
for the rest of your life.

1
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,350
Who are you?

2
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,021
That's a good question.

3
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,750
Is it true that you've changed your name,
and if so, what was your real name?

4
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,946
My real name was Kanodavich.

5
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,718
-Is that the first or the last name?
-That's the first name.

6
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:42,095
Do you think of yourself
primarily as a singer or as a poet?

7
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,029
I think of myself more
as a song and dance man, you know.

8
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,914
-Now you're doing a record for Columbia.
-Yeah. It's coming out in March.

9
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,180
What's it going to be called?

10
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,714
Bob Dylan, I think.

11
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,258
This is a young man
who grew out of a need.

12
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,031
He came here, he came to be as he is...

13
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,031
because things needed saying...

14
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,865
and the young people were the ones
who wanted to say them...

15
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,599
and they wanted to say them
in their own way.

16
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,767
He somehow had an ear
on his generation...

17
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,546
and he has set a pace for many people
and is now....

18
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,817
Well, he's now continuing
in the same way...

19
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,682
and there are many others joining him.

20
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,688
I don't have to tell you.
You know him. He's yours.

21
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,087
Bob Dylan.

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,188
This is called It's Alright, Ma
(I'm Only Bleeding), ho-ho-ho.

23
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:44,741
This young man was born
in Duluth, Minnesota.

24
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:48,150
He started playing the guitar
when he was just a child of 10...

25
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,122
but he says it didn't do him too much good
in high school.

26
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,990
He says the trouble with playing guitar
is you don't get cheerleader girls.

27
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,588
He is one of the most
sought-after folk artists.

28
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,092
I think one of the reasons
for his popularity...

29
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,601
is that he has the mind of a poet.

30
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,631
I've been playing on the stage
since I've been 10.

31
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,199
I was singing Muddy Waters' songs
and writing songs...

32
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,972
and I was singing Woody Guthrie songs.

33
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,311
For 15 years, I've been doing
what I've been doing.

34
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,077
You see, when he came to New York...

35
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,577
one of his prime motives
was to meet Woody Guthrie...

36
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,049
and Woody was in the hospital
with Huntington's chorea...

37
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,610
and he used to play and sing for Woody.

38
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,885
Then I met Bob, and Bob was young...

39
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,927
and he was just recently
arriving in New York.

40
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,923
We ended up staying
in the same hotel, the Earle Hotel...

41
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,230
the guitar picker's home away from home.

42
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,670
So we became fast friends...

43
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,334
and he'd get up and do stuff
that I had just done...

44
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,310
and they'd say, "He's stealing the wind
out of your sails. "

45
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,214
I said, "I got plenty of wind in my sails.
He just likes Woody Guthrie...

46
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,513
"and sings like the real guys do. "

47
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,130
When I was a kid at school...

48
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,393
that's all I wanted to be,
really, was Bob Dylan.

49
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,668
I was a huge fan of early Dylan...

50
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,831
because at one point, I was a folkie.

51
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,240
I had an acoustic guitar
and a harmonica around my neck.

52
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,679
I had my coat hanger,
my little harmonica-holder, and guitar...

53
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,649
when I was 14, like all the other guys.

54
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,881
The first thing I played
was the old folk song Greensleeves.

55
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,433
There was this folk scene going on.
It was the bohemians, the folkies...

56
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,874
the poets, the comedians...

57
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,208
would come out of little coffeehouses.

58
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,976
Like the Gaslight Cafe
was a really popular one.

59
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,244
Dave Van Ronk used to run
the hootenannies there.

60
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,515
Dylan would go in. People would go
and try their new material there.

61
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,814
And at 19, I had my first professional job.

62
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:43,157
I sang around town,
and I had versions of...

63
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,025
I know where I'm goin'

64
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,226
and I know who's goin' with me

65
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,135
I know who I love

66
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,771
but the devil knows who I'll marry

67
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,434
All kinds of wonderful songs...

68
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,304
that drifted to me from various singers.

69
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,015
Those clubs provided a nucleus...

70
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,691
for an instrumental style
and a musical style.

71
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,521
It evolved out of...

72
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,323
crushing young modern songwriters in...

73
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:22,697
with bluegrass players,
old-timey music people...

74
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,430
commie folk singers from New York City...

75
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,564
60 and 70-year-old blues men.

76
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,312
One of the things that happened was
that the rules were being broken.

77
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:15,286
No longer was it a matter
of singing Earth Angel...

78
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,787
and Rock Around the Clock.

79
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,448
You had people like Bob Dylan.

80
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,891
He's one of the great examples
of someone...

81
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,192
who studied and knew the songs
of all the '50s bands...

82
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,255
and knew all the blues writing...

83
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,460
and began to write in his own way...

84
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,402
writing about current politics.

85
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,481
When we all used to
work these coffeehouses...

86
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,493
the way they would pay us
would be to pass a basket around...

87
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,894
and if Richie was in that night,
there wouldn't be any money left...

88
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,933
'cause he was so good
he'd get all the money.

89
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,666
All of those people
were in the very first days...

90
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,331
of their acts...

91
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,944
and that was part of the magic,
is you saw creativity.

92
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:50,145
So writing was big.
There was a lot of poetry still.

93
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,615
There was writing of songs.

94
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:56,485
There was the beginning
of creating social awareness through art.

95
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,362
We were not in competition.

96
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,168
We were students of the same muse.

97
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,066
If somebody did a song of yours...

98
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,636
you were blown away
that they would even think...

99
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,114
that your song
was important enough to do.

100
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,102
I remember Bobby Dylan
was living with me...

101
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,274
in Woodstock for the summer
when Blowin'in the Wind came out.

102
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,912
And there was a sense
of the enormous moment...

103
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,420
of the linkage of the music...

104
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,280
to the political movements of our time.

105
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,558
That movement of the '60s
really had a huge impact...

106
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,358
on my consciousness when I was a child.

107
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,832
I was very aware
of the Civil Rights Movement...

108
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,369
and the part that the music played in it.

109
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,063
You hear Bob Dylan,
Joan Baez, Richie Havens...

110
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,094
and the music was part of a culture.

111
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,436
You'd go to the rallies
and you'd hear the music.

112
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,761
Every summer, throughout the early '60s...

113
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,070
fans came from around the country
to the Newport Folk Festival.

114
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,541
They came to hear everything
from old-timey string bands...

115
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,706
to the newest singer /songwriters.

116
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,359
It was a tradition.

117
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,954
But in the summer of 1965...

118
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,468
Bob Dylan introduced
1 10 volts of electricity...

119
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,935
that turned tradition on its ear.

120
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:03,136
The Newport Folk Festival
was a great ideal.

121
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:07,772
This was the era when kids held hands
and sang We Shall Overcome...

122
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,075
and they hated rock 'n' roll.

123
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,681
Hold it, gentlemen. No noise now.
We got to make the mike check.

124
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,750
By 1965, Bob Dylan was an immense star.

125
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,254
So Dylan comes out
with some friends of his.

126
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,529
-Got the tape.
-Bring that tape up here.

127
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,394
They were setting equipment
up on the stage...

128
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,430
and we'd never seen this equipment
because it was heavy sound equipment.

129
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,500
We didn't know what he was going to do.
Nobody knew.

130
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,150
This explosion of sound
came from the stage.

131
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,896
The audience, and the people backstage
were totally shocked.

132
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,160
We'd never heard this kind of volume
at the Folk Festival.

133
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,356
The audience was in an uproar.
There was screaming and booing.

134
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,414
It was really bad.

135
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:35,065
Pete Seeger ran into a car
and sat in the car holding his ears...

136
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,570
and says, "George, stop that sound."
I said, "I can't stop that sound."

137
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,479
The Beatles were doing a benefit
at the old Paramount.

138
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,145
I thought that Lennon and Dylan
ought to meet. They deserved to meet.

139
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,016
We were backstage,
and Dylan stood in the wings on a chair.

140
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,720
Of course, you couldn't hear the concert.

141
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,952
You could hear nothing
but the girls screeching.

142
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,359
So after that night, he had my wife
drive him over to a place...

143
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,955
where he rented an electric guitar.

144
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,399
Brought it back to my house
and started fiddling around with it.

145
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,869
And after that, he went electric.

146
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,513
A lot of people were angry.

147
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:31,249
I know for a fact
that a lot of people felt betrayed.

148
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,392
It wasn't a controversy
about acoustic versus electric.

149
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:42,127
It was a controversy
about making music that had the integrity.

150
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:51,509
It seemed inconceivable that somebody
could also have as much integrity...

151
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,238
and be playing rock 'n' roll.

152
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,577
Didn't make sense to them,
and so they got furious.

153
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,866
Were you surprised the first time
the boos came?

154
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,267
Yeah, that was at Newport.

155
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,273
I did this very crazy thing.

156
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,702
So, you know, I didn't really know
what was going to happen...

157
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,215
but they certainly booed. I'll tell you that.

158
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,978
You could hear it all over the place.

159
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,486
His name is Bob Dylan.

160
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,229
It was the moment
that separated the men from the boys.

161
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,565
To me, it was the signal
that we'd now grown up.

162
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,231
We had now come of age,
when Dylan went electric...

163
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,968
and we could now do anything...

164
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,272
and everything, and we did it.

165
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,212
When he went electric...

166
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,583
I thought it was a pioneer move.

167
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,054
I thought it was a very brave thing to do...

168
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,083
to move socially conscious music...

169
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,559
into a whole other arena.

170
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,033
He created a new way
that a pop singer could sound.

171
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,531
He basically upped the ante on everything.

172
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,364
Subject matter opened up
for the first time.

173
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:34,394
It wasn't just "my baby and me doing."

174
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,110
The subject matter got very broad,
and into all kinds of areas.

175
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,280
He predicted some of the fragmentation
of thought, of images...

176
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,220
of the society itself.

177
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,890
He's not just mixing it up
album by album or song by song.

178
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,728
With him, it's line by line.

179
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,327
You move into a different world
the next line.

180
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,619
To me, it felt about displacement.

181
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,761
"Without a home." That's how you felt.

182
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,501
"To be on your own." That's how you felt.

183
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,507
All of a sudden, everything is up for grabs.

184
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,956
He certainly painted a picture
of what was going on around him.

185
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:08,399
You know, he's Picasso, to me,
of rock 'n' roll.

186
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,866
He is, by far, my favorite writer
and my favorite singer.

187
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:19,940
Bob Dylan, I think,
absolutely influenced everything...

188
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,277
that came after him...

189
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,415
in pop music or rock music or folk music...

190
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,011
and probably in R & B.

191
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,475
Dylan was the king of folk music
at that time...

192
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,815
and he went over to England
and met the Beatles.

193
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,184
He said, "You guys,
you don't say anything.

194
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,779
"You have nothing to say. "

195
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,415
And it really shocked Lennon.

196
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:44,155
Lennon really was taken back by this...

197
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,062
because he was
a tremendous admirer of Dylan's...

198
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,169
and he started writing
more intellectual lyrics after that.

199
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:55,104
And by the same token, Dylan started
experimenting with music more.

200
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,505
So the two of them
really influenced each other...

201
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,373
in a profound way.

202
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,738
So you had the Dylan influence
on the lyrics...

203
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,112
and the Beatles influence on the music...

204
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,651
and a whole new music was born.

205
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,601
Originally, it was a folkie thing, like...

206
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,164
Hey, Mr. Tambourine man,
play a song for me

207
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,972
And I put it in....

208
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,072
Hey, Mr. Tambourine man

209
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,479
play a song for me

210
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,440
Jim McGuinn went to see
A Hard Day's Night, took us all to see it.

211
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,783
He saw that 12-string guitar
in George Harrison's hand.

212
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,881
I think we saw it at the Picks Theater
on Hollywood Boulevard...

213
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,947
and that was it.

214
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,124
I was playing an acoustic 12-string
from my folk days...

215
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,100
but it wasn't getting the same sound.

216
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,363
George Harrison
had this great-sounding guitar.

217
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,769
It looked like a six-string.
It looked like this.

218
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,240
Then he turned it sideways, and I went....

219
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,504
That's what it is. It's a 12-string electric.

220
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,102
So I went and got one the next day.

221
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,675
What Jim did with the 12-string
was pretty amazing.

222
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,653
It was a big part of it.

223
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,587
And the harmonies....

224
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,285
David Crosby approached
his harmony-singing...

225
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,419
totally unlike anybody.

226
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,223
There was a chemistry.

227
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,026
I'm a natural harmony singer.

228
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,863
It's what I was put here to do, you know...

229
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,234
and anytime either one of them
would start anything...

230
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,034
I would start singing harmony to it.

231
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,075
Gene Clark and I would sing unison...

232
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,043
and Crosby would sing a composite part...

233
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:17,946
developed from thirds
and fourths and fifths of the melody.

234
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,382
I guess he was inspired
by the Everly Brothers.

235
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,511
It was basically just two-part harmony...

236
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:26,921
but because Crosby was popping around
in the different areas of harmony...

237
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,153
it sounded like more harmony
than it really was.

238
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,397
I started incorporating
the 4/ 4 beat with folk music...

239
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,566
and I started doing these things
in the Village.

240
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,835
I was living in the Earle Hotel...

241
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,338
and John Phillips and Michelle
were in a suite on the second floor.

242
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,441
I used go to their room
and hang out with them, and we'd jam.

243
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,587
We were all in the Village,
playing the same clubs...

244
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,021
in this turnaround,
you know, this carousel.

245
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,753
There was no business in California then.
It was all New York.

246
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,688
And we had gone to New York...

247
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,560
to live in New York,
to work out of New York...

248
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,727
and I was obviously...

249
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,038
very homesick.

250
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,600
Then we decided just to go somewhere...

251
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,407
and we let Michelle throw a dart
at the world globe...

252
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,506
and it landed on Saint Thomas,
and that's where we went.

253
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,546
After four months,
we came back to New York...

254
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,054
and no one was in New York.

255
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,114
Roger wasn't there. Crosby wasn't there.

256
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,887
It goes on and on.

257
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,499
So we get to L.A., and lo and behold...

258
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,233
everyone was in L.A.,
with record contracts.

259
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,651
It was a time...

260
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,314
of L.A. becoming a rock center,
a music center.

261
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:42,050
Young musicians were moving here
from everywhere else.

262
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,319
There was a whole generic kind of music...

263
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,194
that was truly peculiar...

264
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,666
and particular to Los Angeles.
That was surfing music.

265
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,603
Obviously, the greatest practitioner
of surf music were the Beach Boys.

266
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,451
But even the Beach Boys could see
that the times were changing.

267
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,963
And Brian Wilson knew
that his band had to change, too.

268
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,832
Brian Wilson was in a situation
that was very commercial.

269
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:28,536
He was being asked to perpetuate
that commerciality...

270
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,597
and did for quite a while.

271
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,348
I got a phone call from Brian.

272
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,388
He was extremely depressed...

273
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,063
about the prospects...

274
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,326
of having to go out on the road.

275
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,893
Brian's quitting the road
was very traumatic.

276
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:06,138
He was really getting into difficulty
in those days.

277
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,470
I had a nervous breakdown
as a result of it.

278
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:11,982
I couldn't handle the strain
of going on tour.

279
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,911
I couldn't handle that kind of strain.

280
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,078
It was like,
you had to get up every morning...

281
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,418
you had to get on the plane, and go places.

282
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,821
I couldn't handle the strain.

283
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,518
There was too much pressure on him.

284
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,051
He couldn't be writing
and arranging and producing...

285
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,430
then going out on the road
because there was too much to do.

286
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,128
When he said,
"I'm not going to tour anymore..."

287
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,534
and he went in and started making...

288
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,971
much more elaborate,
sophisticated music...

289
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,532
he came to the conclusion that
there were other things to look into...

290
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,739
that had more to do with
personal musical growth.

291
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,612
We went in the studio,
tried to get something happening...

292
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:49,676
where we would be better, musically,
than the Beatles.

293
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,989
We realized that they had
something going, like...

294
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,489
I wanna hold your....

295
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,118
They had more electricity
than we had, you know?

296
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,889
But we wanted to do something...

297
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:02,456
that had more musical merit
than the Beatles.

298
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,530
So we made Pet Sounds, which was
Paul McCartney's favorite album.

299
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,491
I wrote that for Carl.
It took me 20 minutes.

300
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,622
Nobody believes this story.

301
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,159
I mean, just to get like....

302
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,570
You know, it took me 20 minutes...

303
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,306
to get that whole core pattern.

304
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,315
It took about two hours to get the lyrics.
But 20 minutes!

305
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:16,096
When we made Pet Sounds,
we made it based on a prayer session.

306
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,009
Carl and I would pray for people.

307
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,706
We'd get together at my house
in Beverly Hills.

308
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,941
We'd sit at this big round table...

309
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,012
and we'd turn the dimmer switch
way down low...

310
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,885
to where we could
almost not see each other.

311
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,517
And sometimes
he'd lead the prayer session...

312
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,093
sometimes I'd lead the prayer session.

313
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,793
But we always prayed.

314
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,802
We prayed that the Lord
help us make a spiritual album for people.

315
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,000
Sure enough, the Lord did.

316
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,175
I knew that Paul and the others
admired it, too.

317
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,814
They wanted to be able to write music
as good as that, or better than that.

318
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,382
It was their yardstick,
and it was a competitive thing.

319
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:14,528
Pet Sounds proved that pop music
could be as sophisticated as a symphony.

320
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,725
More and more musicians began
experimenting and testing the limits.

321
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,436
Albums became artworks,
and the whole world was listening.

322
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,043
It was a weird time.
Everything was happening simultaneously.

323
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,447
The other thing was,
FM radio came into the forefront...

324
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,179
and all of a sudden
kids were exposed to music...

325
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,552
that weren't hit singles.

326
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,887
All of sudden, FM was playing album cuts.

327
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,892
FM opened up the door
to underground music...

328
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,795
and that's why it was so important
back in the '60s.

329
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,664
Tom Donahue programmed
the first underground radio station...

330
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,828
up in San Francisco.

331
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,372
Tom was playing music...

332
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,773
that was being listened to
by college students and young people...

333
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,141
and maybe even being played in clubs...

334
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,271
but really had no exposure.

335
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,106
Somebody listening to FM
might not even know a top 10 single...

336
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,848
and somebody listening to AM
would have no idea who Jimi Hendrix was.

337
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,358
Jimi Hendrix was
the first proper electronic composer...

338
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,917
because he was the first one
who listened to what he was doing.

339
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,910
Jimi Hendrix was an envelope-pusher.

340
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:39,642
He was kicking, with extreme force,
at all the boundaries of music.

341
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,550
We were neighbors.
He lived a block away from me.

342
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,891
We played together a lot
in late-night jams in the Village.

343
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,390
Hendrix had a group
called Jimmy James and the Flames...

344
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,865
and they played in the Village...

345
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,402
at the same time I was playing
in the Village.

346
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,462
He couldn't buy a record contract,
you know.

347
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,629
Before, if you were a Black guy
in America...

348
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,722
you didn't get the same opportunities.

349
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,995
And he had to go to England.

350
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,630
We're English.... Guitar freaks, you know.
We love guitars.

351
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:37,538
They're sort of like another organ
on your body.

352
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,941
I remember the first time
he played in London.

353
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,847
It was down at a club
called the Bag O' Nails.

354
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,384
Everyone was there.

355
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:18,579
Seeing Jimi Hendrix for the first time,
hell of a lot of pain.

356
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,423
Pain, because in his presence...

357
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,086
and in the presence of that music,
you felt small...

358
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,357
and you realized how far you had to go.

359
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,066
Eric Clapton suffered with that as well.

360
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,568
We were both really, really shaken by...

361
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,896
"God, what has happened to us?"

362
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,668
You know, a tornado called Jimi Hendrix.

363
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,377
I saw Jimi Hendrix,
and I said, "I think it's time to quit."

364
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,182
The underground's erupting...

365
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,347
transforming the musical
and cultural landscape.

366
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:38,095
And in 1967, Jimi Hendrix returned home
to a whole new world.

367
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,532
Monterey is very groovy, man.

368
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,700
This is something, man.

369
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:55,143
This is our generation, man.
We're all together, man.

370
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,705
And it's groovy, and dig yourselves
'cause it's really groovy.

371
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,545
What began as a small scene
in Greenwich Village...

372
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,247
had turned into a cultural revolution.

373
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,693
The suit-and-tie men
were not part of that show.

374
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,661
And since there was not
a commercial element...

375
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,927
it was really up from the people,
and that was unprecedented.

376
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,128
We're going to do a show,
and it's not about money or sales...

377
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,568
it's for free.

378
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,263
And everybody did work for free,
except Ravi Shankar...

379
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,572
who came from India with his sitar
and had to make $3,000.

380
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,941
Monterey was the first time Hendrix
ever played for an American audience.

381
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,647
It was the first time Otis Redding
ever played for a white audience.

382
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,555
The first time the San Francisco
groups had ever played...

383
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:44,186
for an international audience
outside the city limits of San Francisco.

384
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,428
Woodstock gets the lion's share
of the attention...

385
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,933
but this was the real groundbreaker.

386
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:56,064
It legitimized rock 'n' roll...

387
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,242
as a concert art form.

388
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:13,349
We tried to find the most talented people
who hadn't been exposed.

389
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:54,764
I first met Janis backstage
at the Fillmore...

390
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,356
in San Francisco.

391
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,536
And I'd been told that if I went back...

392
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,130
to the backstage entrance,
the artists' entrance...

393
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,437
that I would get in free.

394
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,412
Then the door opened,
and Janis was standing there...

395
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:15,084
and said, "Eric, welcome to the Fillmore."

396
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:19,686
She shook my hand,
and as I pulled my hand away...

397
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,885
I looked, and there was a hit
of LSD in my hand...

398
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,684
and I just....

399
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,608
I was so affected
by what had happened at Monterey.

400
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,845
I knew it was going to herald
a social revolution.

401
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,450
It was the purest form of love...

402
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,420
and peace and caring...

403
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,393
I had ever witnessed, before or since.

404
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,056
It was, you know, peace, love, and flowers.

405
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,254
I had played with The Who...

406
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,591
at Murray the K's Easter Show.

407
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:43,957
So at the Monterey staff meetings...

408
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:48,036
I would say, "Just know that these guys
are going to come out...

409
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,537
"and wreck everything."

410
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,841
You know,
I would suggest that they close.

411
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:07,751
I couldn't deal with the idea
that at this critical concert...

412
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,219
we might go on after Jimi.

413
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,425
"You want to be first up there
with the guitar smashing. "

414
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,334
I said, "Jimi, I swear to you,
that's not what it's about."

415
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,928
Jimi started to play.

416
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,567
He stood on a chair in front of me,
and he started to play.

417
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,974
It was just Jimi on a chair, playing at me.

418
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,677
Playing at me like that.

419
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,183
You know,
"Don't fuck with me, you little shit."

420
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,513
Then he snapped out of it,
and he put the guitar down...

421
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,114
and he said, "Okay, let's toss a coin."

422
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,649
So we tossed a coin,
and we got to go on first.

423
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,933
He then went on immediately
after us, I think.

424
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,411
I don't think
there was anybody in between.

425
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,814
So I went out to sit with Mama Cass
to watch Jimi.

426
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,979
As he started doing the stuff
with his guitar...

427
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,023
she turned around, she said to me:

428
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,785
"He's stealing your act."

429
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:19,228
And I said, "No, he's not stealing my act...

430
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,930
"he's doing my act."

431
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,575
The Who and Jimi
were determined to outdo each other...

432
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,077
and I'm not sure who really won.

433
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,477
I mean, Jimi humped the amp...

434
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,612
broke his guitar, burned it up in flames.

435
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,016
The Who blew up the entire stage.

436
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:50,493
Both acts, both The Who and Hendrix,
smashed up equipment...

437
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,326
during their appearance there.

438
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,961
And yet, one is like a violent rape...

439
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,501
and the other is like an erotic sacrifice.

440
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,602
We didn't know
that you could do that, you know.

441
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,772
"He's lighting that thing on fire! "

442
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,715
"How dare they break up a drum set?"

443
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,047
They obviously
had gotten a new sense of theatrics...

444
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:21,080
that nobody
had even conceived of previously.

445
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:28,658
You know, what The Who were doing
was transcendent in a lot of ways.

446
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,293
But what Jimi was doing was sublimely....

447
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,435
It was an epiphany.

448
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,698
Right now I'm gonna do a little thing
by Bob Dylan.

449
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,836
That's his jammer over there.

450
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,870
It's a little thing called
Like a Rolling Stone.

451
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,524
There's nobody like him.
I mean, there really isn't.

452
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:32,323
I mean, there's Dylan and Hendrix,
and, you know, who else?

453
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,382
There was something
really important happening...

454
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:03,051
which was that this great music
that we've discovered...

455
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,992
this great music which is still growing...

456
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,223
this music which now
you can write songs about...

457
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,629
what's really happening
deep, deep inside of you...

458
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,793
and what's happening around you
in the world...

459
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,133
can also sound extraordinary.

460
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,046
That was just a step-by-step progression...

461
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,743
of just expanding the whole idea of
"anything is possible."

462
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,784
There were no rules,
and you can do whatever you want.

463
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,452
Before that, there were rules...

464
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,760
and only certain kinds of songs
were deemed capable of succeeding...

465
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,266
on the radio or the pop landscape.

466
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,229
But the Beatles broke those rules,
and got away with it...

467
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,568
as Bob Dylan did here,
in his own early way...

468
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,370
as people like The Byrds followed up on.

469
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:57,479
The Bohemian element that
had been a minority became a majority.

470
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:00,278
It seemed to take over the whole planet.

471
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,725
It was a great sense of...

472
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,300
"Yeah. There's a future.

473
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,771
"There's a future for us all."

474
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,831
Even though, you know,
the world was in flames...

475
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,872
over in Asia.

1
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,716
I think that was the difference
with the '60s...

2
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,755
is that people didn't care
to explain themselves.

3
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,648
If people didn't get it, they weren't invited.

4
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,819
The last chance you had to shock people
just by the way you looked...

5
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,387
just by the way you were.

6
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,332
You didn't even have to think about it,
or work at it at all.

7
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,393
You could just walk down the street,
and people go, "Oh, my God."

8
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,495
That was fun.

9
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,030
Marty just asked, "Hey, do you wanna
start a band?" to a total stranger.

10
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,873
I said, "Sure."
Seemed to be the thing to do at the time.

11
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,740
Here music is blaring forth
from the open windows...

12
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,478
of an apartment on the corner
of Haight and Ashbury.

13
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,648
While in the street below, a crowd
of hippies celebrates the sunny day.

14
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,926
Traffic stops. The crowd grows.

15
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,298
Finally, the police roll in
with paddy wagons and nightsticks.

16
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,801
We were much too busy
being in the middle of the '60s...

17
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,506
to wonder, even to this day,
why San Francisco?

18
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,948
San Francisco's always been
a border town, borderland kind of town...

19
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,077
where all the strange people
come to do strange things.

20
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,815
Stranger than most things.

21
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,388
Drugs, social experimentation,
sexual experimentation...

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,895
anti-authoritarian,
if you will, experimentation.

23
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,167
It was antiestablishment.

24
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,472
It was the first
openly antiestablishment musical scene.

25
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,844
There really was no audience,
you know, to speak of.

26
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,211
There was no
entertainer-entertained thing.

27
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,221
Everybody was entertaining.
Everything there was entertaining.

28
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,190
Every event, everything that happened
was entertaining.

29
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,603
The experience was communal
in the sense that...

30
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,840
Santana, the Grateful Dead,
Big Brother & the Holding Company....

31
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,441
We played many gigs together,
benefits, strange gatherings...

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,452
of what they call "the tribes "
for lack of a better word.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,455
It was very pagan,
and a celebration of human events.

34
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,954
It was a celebration
of humanity around you...

35
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,927
enjoying the people that you were with
to the nth degree...

36
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,964
enjoying the herbs and vegetables
that God gave to us.

37
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,124
I'm out of drugs.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,896
I don't have any on me.
Ask across the room.

39
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,529
-Do you have any drugs?
-Excuse us, you have drugs?

40
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,798
We were just another signal
that things are changing.

41
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,942
Basic institutions
are crumbling about you...

42
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,575
and it's chaos.

43
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,687
The incidents are so bad...

44
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,725
so contrary to our standards
of human behavior...

45
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,662
that I couldn't possibly recite them to you
here from this platform in detail.

46
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,925
Three rock 'n'roll bands
were in the center of the gymnasium...

47
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,128
playing simultaneously
all during the dance...

48
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,433
and movies were shown on two screens.

49
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,167
These movies were the only lights
in the gym proper.

50
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,177
They consisted of color sequences
that gave the appearance...

51
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,975
of different-colored liquids
spreading across the screen...

52
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,709
followed by shots
of men and women on occasion.

53
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,946
Shots where the men and women's
nude torsos twisted and gyrated...

54
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,954
in provocative and sensual fashion.

55
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,658
So music was like the pied piper...

56
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,630
that led kids off the asphalt
and out of the suburbs...

57
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,996
and into some other kind of reality.

58
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,264
So we began creating free stores...

59
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,664
where the goods were free
and the rolls were free.

60
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,801
Free food, crash pads, free medical clinics.

61
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,912
-Are you a musician looking for a band?
-Doing what?

62
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,507
Bass guitar, lead guitar, drums, anything.

63
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,346
-Do they need a singer?
-No. I don't think anybody needs a singer.

64
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,553
And by some fluke or an accident...

65
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,717
I discovered I had
this incredibly loud voice.

66
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,260
I started singing blues
because that was always what I liked.

67
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,731
And you know, I got in a bluegrass band.

68
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,703
Played hillbilly music for free beer.

69
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:24,922
I first saw Janis Joplin when she sat in
with Big Brother at the A valon Ballroom.

70
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,188
We played together at the Family Dog
and started falling in love...

71
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,664
and lived together
for 4, 5, 6 months, I guess...

72
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,996
at a couple of different locations
in the Haight.

73
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,366
The Janis that I knew
was not the performer...

74
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,530
the public was familiar with.

75
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,335
She was very relaxed, very intelligent,
very creative...

76
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:48,076
ambitious, but not overly ambitious,
and very into her family...

77
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:52,206
and enjoying the community
of the Haight-Ashbury...

78
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:56,244
which was very small
and very affectionate at that time.

79
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,804
What do you think
young people are looking for today?

80
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,033
Sincerity and a good time.

81
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,575
Are they finding it?

82
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,177
I don't know about you, daddy....

83
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,045
I'm fine. At least I'm having a good time.

84
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,812
They're looking for people
not to lie to them.

85
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,643
Kids today aren't gonna accept
what's laid down by the older generation.

86
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,179
They only want you to grow up,
get an education, raise children, and die.

87
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,022
There's a whole sense of freedom
in San Francisco right now.

88
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,723
And when you have a city that's free
and the youth are free...

89
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,857
they'll go in every direction they can.

90
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,709
After the first thing
called the Human Be-ln...

91
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,882
it was like, yeah, there is all these people,
there is a community.

92
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,617
There is this whole, big community.

93
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,285
We're all those people
who are the weird ones.

94
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,628
All of a sudden you discovered
all these people who are like you.

95
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,991
And they were all people
who were influenced by the beatniks.

96
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,802
The beats were
into their authentic expression.

97
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:22,671
They were into living authentic lives
that were based on their real feelings...

98
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,403
not their conditioned feelings.

99
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:28,846
And I think they stood as a kind of beacon
to personal integrity, in that way.

100
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:33,249
So you add psychedelics to that,
and you've got the Haight-Ashbury.

101
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,383
The hippies are capable
of extremely hard work.

102
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,856
This is the house of a popular local band
which plays hard rock music.

103
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,928
They call themselves the Grateful Dead.

104
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,591
They live together comfortably
in what could be called affluence.

105
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,968
There are many other similar houses
or apartments in Haight-Ashbury...

106
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,267
maintained by hippies
who work in places...

107
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,640
where employers do not mind
bizarre dress or long hair.

108
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,145
Their concept of a new style of life
unites them.

109
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,116
We would all like to be able
to live an uncluttered life...

110
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,846
a simple life, a good life, you know,
and, like...

111
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,083
think about moving
the whole human race ahead a step...

112
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,522
or a few steps.

113
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,754
Yeah, or half a step.

114
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,819
Most of the people who are hippies now
came to it through drugs.

115
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,424
-Yeah, but it's not a dope movement.
-We're not pushing dope.

116
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,366
I think, personally...

117
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,735
that the more people turn on,
a better world this could be.

118
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,615
This traveling road show with
the Grateful Dead and the Pranksters...

119
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,625
came swirling through called

120
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,852
Can You Pass the Acid Test?

121
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,791
So I was all for that.

122
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:58,030
I'm looking to always expand
my horizons and peripheries...

123
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,299
and saw them off if possible.

124
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,712
Acid became a big part of the thing
while it was still legal.

125
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,112
As soon as they saw that people
were having fun...

126
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,013
they, of course, made it illegal.

127
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:15,781
Common hallucinogenic experiences
were like tribal harvest festivals...

128
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,550
and the Sadie Hawkins Day.

129
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,218
Total abandon.

130
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:23,194
Rejecting everything and looking
for something positive and new...

131
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,460
a total sexual abandon, drug abandon,
dancing abandon.

132
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,834
We had an opportunity
to visit highly experimental places...

133
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,896
under the influence
of highly experimental chemicals...

134
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,634
before a highly experimental audience.

135
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,778
It was ideal.

136
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,051
It's an interactive event,
the Grateful Dead.

137
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,458
We've become one big entity
tied at the heart. That's what it's about.

138
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,225
We're not the whole event,
but we're an important part.

139
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,631
We're what the event sounds like,
and we offer a space to ritualize.

140
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,324
So these were, like, mass excuses
for letting yourself go...

141
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,363
without being the spotlight of anything.
Even the bands....

142
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,958
Grace used to say, the only reason she
enjoyed being on stage at these things...

143
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,061
was because the stage
was the least crowded place at the party.

144
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,869
And you could see up over everybody
and see what was going on everywhere.

145
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,707
One time I hitchhiked from Austin
to San Francisco with this guy.

146
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,548
His name is Chet Helms.

147
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,019
Later, he got involved
in promoting the dances in San Francisco.

148
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,750
I loved the acoustic draping
in the Avalon...

149
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,123
which gave it a wonderful warm interior...

150
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,128
womb-like sound.

151
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,125
I loved the sprung dance floor, which...

152
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,930
if you got 300 or 400 people
dancing on the floor at one time...

153
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,039
the floor would rise to meet you
and lift you even higher.

154
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,236
The Avalon and such similar institutions...

155
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,005
are the few socializing institutions...

156
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,606
which teach people
how to live and be with one another.

157
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,675
They were experimenting
with being loose at the beginning.

158
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,777
It's like, "Oh, my God, it's safe here.

159
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,018
"And I can eat my chocolate cigarettes
without anybody catching me.

160
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,822
"I can hug a girl,
or I can put paint on my face...

161
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,228
"I can put on Goodwill clothes.
I can act out cavalierism. "

162
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:43,596
There was a very nice feeling of
open-airness even though it was indoors.

163
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:48,363
Well, Chet was the mellow guy.

164
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,872
Bill was the bully.

165
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,209
So Chet did it in a nice, homespun way...

166
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,838
and Bill was really aggressive...

167
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,942
and really wanted to make a home
for rock 'n' roll. He had big plans.

168
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,222
There was a jam session. Michael Murphey
was playing a Hammond organ...

169
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,693
and Jerry Garcia was playing guitar.
Paul Kantner was playing guitar.

170
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,322
I waited for Jerry to finish his solo...

171
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,798
and then they said, "Go ahead, "
so I jumped on it...

172
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,097
and when I finished,
Bill came over and said:

173
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,898
"That's pretty good. You got a band?"

174
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,666
I said, "Yeah, I got a band."

175
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,139
"Okay. I want you
to come on over and open up...

176
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,373
"for The Loading Zone and The Who."

177
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,041
At that time everybody was playing blues.

178
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,416
Jimi Hendrix, Cream, John Mayall.

179
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,786
Just louder, and maybe a little more
adventuresome chord...

180
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,324
but it was still the blues.

181
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,382
We came out with some blues...

182
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,028
but the foundation was Afro-Cuban music.

183
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,161
So all of a sudden,
the women could dance.

184
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,999
It wasn't this, "Wanna dance, honey?"

185
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,300
"My name is George.
What's yours? Charlotte?"

186
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,939
"Out of sight, Charlotte."

187
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,339
They would walk in,
and if 10 people were dancing...

188
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,901
they'd join the circle.
Or they'd see one girl standing there...

189
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,739
and they would just move.

190
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,215
They may not say anything
to each other all night...

191
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,115
or they may leave together.

192
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,086
But if they didn't leave together,
there was a thank you.

193
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,581
Okay.

194
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:15,619
It was a fantasy,
but it was nice, and it was healthy.

195
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,490
And nobody lost.

196
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,031
And the key to those years for me
was that everybody won...

197
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,461
and nobody lost.

198
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,301
The musicians had a good time.
The producer had a good time.

199
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,372
The public had a good time.

200
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,614
Taking their social cue...

201
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,244
from the idea of endless summer
and California culture...

202
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,516
all of a sudden, almost overnight...

203
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,026
people were growing their hair long...

204
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,127
taking lots of drugs...

205
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,187
and trying their darnedest
to all screw each other freely.

206
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,799
Sexuality became less important...

207
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:58,964
oddly enough.

208
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,507
In the sense that, you didn't have to spend
this long courting time...

209
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:06,407
of the boy always figuring out a way
to get inside the girl's pants.

210
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,211
There were no pants. It was the '60s.

211
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,910
Thank you very much.

212
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,947
I'll be doing one of those other things.

213
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,286
A thing dedicated
to that little girl over there called Hartley.

214
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,155
Thing called Foxey Lady, look out!

215
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,176
I got woken up at 7:00 in the morning,
and I'm really sleepy.

216
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,051
But then I open the door
and see somebody that appeals to me.

217
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,558
First of all, I think, "What in the world
is she doing here?"

218
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,692
And she says, "Maybe, can I come in?"

219
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,429
And I'm standing there
and really digging her.

220
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,233
She's really nice-looking.
It's the honest-to-God truth.

221
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:11,106
She's about 19 or 20,
or beyond the age of so-and-so.

222
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,779
And I say, "Oh,"
and I probably stand there and then....

223
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,621
Physical desire is very normal,
and it happens...

224
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,487
and there's nothing wrong with it.

225
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,755
I think that sex is just much groovier
when there is love.

226
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,126
There's a lot more happening...

227
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,927
but there's nothing wrong
with just sex for sex.

228
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,046
I remember Eric Burdon saying about...

229
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,253
the difference between the way...

230
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:00,884
I smashed up a guitar, played a guitar,
ate a guitar, or set fire to a guitar...

231
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,622
and Jimi Hendrix was that...

232
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,824
with Jimi Hendrix it was erotic,
and with me it was rage.

233
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,854
If you always go to a movie,
and there's a little screen...

234
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,521
and then all of a sudden
they give you Cinemascope...

235
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,463
and that was the music of Jimi Hendrix.

236
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,229
Even on blues changes,
his music was very wide.

237
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:57,004
When I feel like playing with my teeth,
I do it 'cause I feel like it.

238
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,754
When I'm on stage,
I'm a complete natural...

239
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,290
more so than talking to a group of people
or something.

240
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,758
Jimi Hendrix...

241
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,736
had this kind of role of exorcist.
He put Vietnam into that amplifier.

242
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,450
He's the great instrumental genius
of rock 'n' roll.

243
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,861
There wasn't necessarily just one way
that the world was gonna be...

244
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,457
whether it was spiritual power, emotional
power, sexual power, or physical power.

245
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:52,595
Hendrix, all people who just came in
and knocked all those doors down.

246
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:57,403
His guitar-playing spoke
of some deep ecstasy that could be had.

247
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,105
Around '66,
it was more of the psychedelic.

248
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,711
People would get more experimental...

249
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,478
like Hendrix and the Doors.

250
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,578
I thought it was very dark music
when I heard it.

251
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,206
I thought it was kind of
mysterious and dark.

252
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,748
I didn't know what to make of it.

253
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,388
I thought the words were really good.

254
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,324
You could tell right away
that we got a writer here.

255
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,990
Jim Morrison was a post-Beat writer.

256
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,162
He was absolutely influenced
by Kerouac, Ginsberg:

257
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,228
Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac.

258
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,294
We tried to find that freedom
in art, poetry, and music...

259
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:34,237
whereas the Beats were all
into literature and poetry and jazz.

260
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,803
We tried to combine poetry and music,
poetry and rock 'n' roll.

261
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,511
The creation of the Doors,
it happened to be in California.

262
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,214
But obviously what was going on was...

263
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,123
a psychedelic revolution was happening
in all of the major cities...

264
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,289
and then into the minor small-town
college towns all across America.

265
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,298
It was happening in New York
and Chicago and San Francisco...

266
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,833
and Seattle and Portland.

267
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,403
I was a perfect age...

268
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,408
to get the full effect of psychedelia.

269
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,082
I was, like, 16 years old,
watching Jimi Hendrix play...

270
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,813
and going to Hyde Park
to see The Rolling Stones...

271
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,947
and listening to
all the American psychedelic bands...

272
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,186
the sort of San Franciscans,
sort of odd bunch...

273
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,051
but also the Velvet Underground
and the Doors.

274
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,538
The psychedelic craze was in.

275
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,713
We wanted to go against the grain...

276
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,749
as far as the flavor of music at that time.

277
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:57,281
We turned it back and went more blues...

278
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,847
and more roots music-oriented.

279
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,489
So when we played
for Bill Graham at Fillmore East...

280
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,521
that was one of our requests,
to turn the light show way down...

281
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,157
if not completely off.

282
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,020
Bob Dylan got us to Woodstock.

283
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:40,690
We played with Bob for some shows
through the United States and Canada.

284
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,893
We followed Bob up to the country...

285
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,436
and started getting together
in the afternoons...

286
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,529
and tried to come up with tunes.

287
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,541
Bob and Richard
used to have a typewriter...

288
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,768
that sat on the coffee table
there in the living room...

289
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,111
and the two of them would go by
and type little notes to each other...

290
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,818
and one would read
what the other one wrote...

291
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,048
put a couple lines in under that.

292
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,953
A lot of times, by the end of the day...

293
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,515
we'd have a couple or three pages
out of that.

294
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,631
Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll...

295
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:23,937
those are the things that they're using
to sell rock 'n' roll...

296
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,569
which seems a damn shame,
when you get down to it.

297
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:30,274
The music is certainly capable
of doing that on its own.

298
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,434
The Stones eroticized it.

299
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,268
Made it wild, made it dangerous...

300
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,672
made it revolutionary, made it druggy.

301
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,807
The Beatles were taking drugs
but nobody knew.

302
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,109
You only knew if you hung out with them.

303
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:06,912
But the Stones took drugs in public,
on stage.

304
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,083
Yeah, my buddy, old Lucifer.

305
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,054
It went like this.

306
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,317
Maybe we are, I don't know.

307
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,395
It was a lark.
Five guitar players.

308
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,331
We're gonna overthrow the country...

309
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,897
and they start to treat us
like revolutionaries.

310
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,205
Christ, just smoking a little dope,
you know.

311
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:36,803
And then you got half of Scotland Yard
working full time on you.

312
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,214
Surely you've got better things to do, boy.

313
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,458
Keith did his homework very carefully.

314
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,527
Jagger did his homework carefully.

315
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,065
He'd seen Tina Turner.
He'd seen Little Richard.

316
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,193
He learned from the best.

317
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,634
Most great artists
watch the best person out there...

318
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,368
and they emulate that person...

319
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:08,140
and then after a while,
it grows into their own particular style.

320
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,919
This little break kind of sexually charged
the whole thing, really.

321
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,354
I'm just the same as a stripper.

322
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,526
and take off lots of my clothes.

323
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,293
There's not really much difference
between stripping and being a rock singer.

324
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:33,394
America was a fairyland,
and all the best music came from there...

325
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,306
and they had the best cars,
and the chicks looked better.

326
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:43,476
So it was like throwing
a load of demons into heaven...

327
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,105
and letting them loose.

328
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,450
The television is boring me.

329
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,523
Let's make sure there ain't nobody there.

330
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,260
Okay, just tell us when.

331
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,195
Okay, now.

332
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,173
I've done worse, I've done far more.

333
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,649
The Beatles and the Stones, obviously.

334
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:57,211
Cream came over
with real challenging musical landscapes...

335
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,216
and pushing what the Beatles opened up...

336
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,988
beyond the three-chord,
four-chord kind of songs...

337
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,619
making anything possible.

338
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:26,779
Cream: Ginger Baker,
Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton. Great group.

339
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,553
One night, Jerry and I
went into the Winterland...

340
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,953
and I thought,
"This is the best band in the world. "

341
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,925
I said, "Is this the best band in the world?"
He said, "Tonight, they are."

342
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,794
Cream, The Who, Jimi Hendrix...

343
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,497
but today, you don't have
a handful of bands...

344
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,235
that are so unique in their own right.

345
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,310
Jamming was very important.

346
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,320
This was the residue
of Jimi Hendrix and Cream.

347
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,947
That approach involved much more
virtuosity as an instrumentalist.

348
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,887
Less emphasis on song structures...

349
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,589
and simple pop structures
and things like that...

350
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:16,197
and much more emphasis
on prowess as a musician.

351
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:25,364
Time when Cream came out,
and we were in school...

352
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,138
and we heard the song Spoonful.

353
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,612
So okay, we could figure
that two-note riff:

354
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,744
So we could figure that far,
and then Clapton just goes:

355
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,681
For me, I went:

356
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,125
"We'll never get that."

357
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,324
At the time that I started playing...

358
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,394
most guitar players were trying...

359
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,835
to follow other white players.

360
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:02,710
I was much more racial about it.
I wanted to be like a Black guitar player.

361
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,588
Ginger Baker was scary back then,
he was so good.

362
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,027
For three pieces, I'd never heard
three pieces that were better.

363
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,592
Ginger Baker, Keith Moon.

364
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,099
Keith Moon's another drummer
that everybody overlooks.

365
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,465
He was an incredible drummer.

366
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,624
Keith, what's your opinion
of your public image?

367
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,222
I think it varies
with every record I put out.

368
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,766
I think, sometimes....
Could you get on with it?

369
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,427
Will you keep it together?

370
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,729
No, I think I'm very reliant
on my management...

371
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,033
and my public relations people.

372
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,150
Everybody's trying
to be unique and innovative...

373
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,878
but few really achieve that.

374
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,983
Like, the Beatles had a distinct sound.
The Stones had a distinct sound.

375
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,687
When you hear them, you know it's them.
The Grateful Dead, The Who.

376
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,338
When you start smashing your guitar
on a stage in Germany...

377
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,071
it happened in parts of the States...

378
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,673
a policeman would walk on the stage,
put a gun to my head, and say:

379
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,978
"Stop, or I'll shoot you."

380
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,651
"Hold on a minute. This is a guitar,
not a human being, remember?"

381
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,527
It became hugely important
because it was actually perceived to be...

382
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,160
a social statement...

383
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,166
to attack the country
in which we'd grown up.

384
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,868
We say, we love our country,
but it's decaying. It's going.

385
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,342
There's a new world ahead of us.

386
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,591
Rock 'n' roll was the beginning
of the brand new world...

387
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,760
in terms of a generation...

388
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,854
bringing on its own consciousness
through music...

389
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,796
to other generations.

390
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,865
Looking out at Woodstock...

391
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,378
something I expected
should and did happen.

392
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,872
That was our national celebration...

393
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,714
of multicultural community.

394
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,945
Woodstock was the top of the mountain,
the plateau.

395
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:01,786
We got up there. We were now able
to walk across.

396
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:06,757
We had actually reached a point
in time and place...

397
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:10,458
which could never be erased
from the history of the world.

398
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,942
It's really amazing.

399
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,675
It's like some kind of Biblical, epochal...

400
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,983
unbelievable scene.

401
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,418
Suddenly the whole world
was indeed watching us...

402
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,954
and we had a chance to show the world
what it would be like...

403
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,168
to pull ourselves up
by our collective bootstraps...

404
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,339
and let them see how it would be
if we ran the show.

405
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,748
I remember being up in a helicopter
with the state cops.

406
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,224
One cop said to the other,
"Those hippies are smoking dope there."

407
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:14,455
And the other said, "I ain't gonna
do anything about it. Are you?"

408
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,090
The other one said....

409
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,793
We were just flying in
and I suddenly realized:

410
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,463
We could do anything we want.

411
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,632
There's just more of us than them.

412
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,389
There were many messages
that we wanted to convey to people...

413
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,652
about civil rights, about pacifism.

414
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,854
But there seemed to be no entry
to mass media at all...

415
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,557
and along came the Beatles
and The Rolling Stones...

416
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,499
and suddenly we all snapped.

417
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,594
These messages can be put
in the form of rock 'n' roll.

418
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,947
We were the rock 'n' rollers
who became those radical...

419
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,957
or radicalized kids of the '60s.

420
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,290
Woodstock was not
sex, drugs, and rock 'n'roll.

421
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:21,856
It was civil rights. It was Vietnam War.
It was youth power.

422
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,265
It was the nation coming together.

423
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,503
It started in the '50s
as part of the Civil Rights Movement.

424
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,198
In other words...

425
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:05,401
the gains that were made
for most Americans...

426
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,239
were not made for all Americans.

427
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:10,109
How are we gonna tell people
in Vietnam how to live...

428
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,911
if we can't treat our own people
right over here?

429
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,748
And what about sending people there
who are too young to vote on it?

430
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:20,253
Why is it somebody could go over
and get shot for their country...

431
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,815
and can't go and have a beer
for their country?

432
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,692
You want a 15-year-old girl
sleeping in the field in a tent?

433
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,231
Are you out of your mind?
Never should have happened.

434
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,427
You feel bad about the kids
who were killed in Vietnam?

435
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,595
-This has nothing to do--
-It's the same thing.

436
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,605
Nothing to do with it.
There's no comparison.

437
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:39,336
People got more excited about
the kids in Monticello than they do about--

438
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,536
It never should've happened.

439
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:44,308
Unlike a lot of protest, antiwar songs...

440
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,974
of that whole entire decade...

441
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,774
Fixin' To Die Rag was embraced...

442
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,912
by military personnel in Vietnam,
much to my surprise.

443
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,594
You see how they function on their own.

444
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,004
Without cops, without guns,
without clubs, without hassles.

445
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,305
Everybody pools together
and everybody helps each other. It works.

446
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,744
It's been working since we got here.
And it's gonna continue working.

447
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,408
When they go back to the city,
this thing is happening.

448
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,849
It proves that it can happen.

449
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:30,083
"If you have any food left, share it
with your brother and your sister.

450
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,230
"And that's the person on your right
and the person on your left."

451
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,257
One of the things that began to happen
with the Be-ln, with Woodstock...

452
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:42,130
was a kind of verification...

453
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,035
that there were
substantial numbers of people...

454
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,079
interested in new ways of living
and a new culture...

455
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,980
and sometimes getting them all together
in a big group...

456
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:55,450
where you can see each other,
is the best way to support them.

457
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,230
Jamming is playing hooky.
It's really that simple.

458
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,334
When I was in the Mission High School,
I played a lot of hooky.

459
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:24,245
We didn't know what the hell a bridge was
or a chorus was or a verse was.

460
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,716
We couldn't care less.
We just wanted to play what we heard.

461
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,449
If you stay in your heart,
you will always be inspired...

462
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,223
and if you're inspired,
you will always be enthusiastic.

463
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:43,256
There is nothing more contagious
on this planet than enthusiasm.

464
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:48,028
The songs become incidental.
What people receive is your joy.

465
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,316
If you wanna grab somebody
from their lapels...

466
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,621
and you wanna make them, like,
"listen to me," you go....

467
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:14,828
You're hitting two notes
at the same time instead of....

468
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,834
Sounds tame, but if you go....

469
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,684
You have to have real deep convictions
before you hit that note.

470
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,919
Most of the time, people go, "Damn! "

471
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,854
Because whether
it's Ry Cooder or whoever...

472
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,359
they hit one note...

473
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,923
every hair on your body's
going to stand up.

474
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:28,461
And you feel like you just made love
or you just touched God's feet...

475
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,769
or both at the same time, you know.

476
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,035
That's when music is really good.

477
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,773
That's what I learned from Coltrane,
Bob Marley, and Jimi Hendrix...

478
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,543
is that music is a complete ocean.

479
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,580
Music is the whole thing, man.

480
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,848
It's an expression
of the younger generation.

481
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,085
We have the power,
we have the tolerance...

482
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,185
we can go in front
of the television camera...

483
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,060
we can go on the air and we can say
with definition...

484
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,929
that Hitler was wrong,
that people who hate Negroes are wrong.

485
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,162
We can get up there
and shout it to the world.

486
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:02,694
When rock 'n' roll came along,
it gave power to the kids on the street.

487
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,331
It gave them something to do.

488
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,536
It gave them a feeling that
there was something that was theirs...

489
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:12,105
that was not a part of their parents' world,
and it was beloved because of that.

490
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,528
I was hanging out with Stephen.
They had thrown me out of the Byrds.

491
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:34,537
I was singing harmony with him
because he had great songs.

492
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,867
We dragged Nash off someplace
and sang with him.

493
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,605
It was an astounding thing, what he did.

494
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,010
How do he do that?

495
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,877
We knew what we wanted to do then.

496
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,726
You got to understand.

497
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,826
Here's three guys that had been
and had bad relationships in bands.

498
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,532
David was thrown out of the Byrds.
The Buffalo Springfield had broken up.

499
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,202
The Hollies were less than desired by me.

500
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,540
We didn't want to be in a band again, ever.

501
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,242
And we realized that we would
have to be in a band...

502
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,979
because we wanted this sound.
We wanted to do it.

503
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,884
That's all we wanted to do.

504
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,023
How was the festival in general?
Would you consider it a success?

505
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,262
It was incredible.

506
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:43,102
It was probably the strangest thing
that's ever happened in the world.

507
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,674
I still have my mud.

508
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:52,114
About two nights ago, that place up there
was the second biggest city in New York.

509
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:56,050
People would begin to follow the festivals
not so much for the tunes...

510
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,180
but to get together
and create these instant cities...

511
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,692
to do this life support,
to figure out the food, the garbage...

512
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,160
the whole deal, and to live this...

513
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,754
positive, creative anarchy...

514
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:12,166
that I think eventually began to terrify
the powers that be.

515
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:16,332
Well, all I can say,
I dug it. It was a good festival.

516
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,965
I've been to four festivals now...

517
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,076
and it's about the second best one
I've been to.

518
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,771
My favorite was Kickapoo.

519
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,249
It was the worst drug orgy
that was ever held in the United States.

520
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,650
This wasn't just camping out...

521
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,617
like sportsmen do...

522
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,217
or even outdoor enthusiasts.
This was wallowing.

523
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,193
You bathe like this often?

524
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,823
I just.... No this is the first time
since I've been here.

525
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,663
Do you feel the festival
had some motivation...

526
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,363
in the fact that you're bathing nude?

527
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:52,137
Definitely. I wouldn't be bathing nude
if other people weren't bathing nude, too.

528
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,052
It's in the spirit of the whole festival.

529
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,956
You know, people sharing the water.

530
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,091
We had this incredibly tight
harmony sound...

531
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,998
and where was room
for somebody else here?

532
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,967
He was just so musical and so good...

533
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,210
that we thought, maybe cramming four...

534
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:06,010
into a space that's only big enough
for three will be explosive.

535
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,215
Neil was something else.
What a piece of work he was.

536
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,915
Neil was sharing a room with a gerbil.

537
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,753
Actually, two bush babies.

538
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,517
He was. Harriet and Speedy.

539
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,155
In the Caravan Lodge motel
in San Francisco.

540
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,131
You'd walk in and these things
would ricochet past your face.

541
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,667
They'd go....

542
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,864
-He'd say, "Don't let them out! "
-I'm not kidding.

543
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,668
-I'm not kidding.
-Insane.

544
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,437
Harriet and Speedy, the bush babies.

545
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,478
Of course, Neil is the guy
with 300 chickens in his basement...

546
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,109
because he'd been given a present
of two chickens and couldn't kill them.

547
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,119
Neil has had an incredible career.

548
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:47,214
The godfather of grunge and all that,
whatever they're calling him now.

549
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,197
I was into the rock 'n' roll
and the whole hippie concept.

550
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,863
To me, it ended with Woodstock...

551
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,937
and a lot of people thought
it was just beginning...

552
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,377
but my interpretation was
you're going to have some jive in it.

553
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:12,074
It used to be "Share this, share that. "

554
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,444
That had its own kind of protection...

555
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,956
'cause it was all done, weird as it sounds,
out of love, whatever they was doing.

556
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,417
There was a moment there
where there was a vision.

557
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,018
There was a very clear, wonderful vision...

558
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,494
but it had to do with everybody
acting in good faith.

559
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,692
It had to do with everybody
behaving right.

560
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,931
Okay. Everybody knows
there's something funny going on.

561
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,131
Your money in your pocket!

562
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,039
-Want to make more money, you prick?
-Turn it up!

563
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,213
Man, you got your money!
Come on! Let them in!

564
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,776
You're in the revolution, man. Let them in!

565
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,650
The question of kids now wanting
everything to be free is hard to handle...

566
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,757
because it's hard to talk to those kids.

567
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:57,453
-Even you?
-Even me, what? Hard to talk?

568
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,860
-Yeah.
-Of course. Because...

569
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,631
to them, I represent, among other things,
somebody who has money...

570
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,827
and that makes them angry.

571
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:08,167
The Isle of Wight Festival
was the "hate the performer" festival.

572
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,571
It was bigger than Woodstock,
and it was international.

573
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,902
It was surrounded by a galvanized fence
which went all the way around it.

574
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,778
The audience was rough and unruly...

575
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,513
and they booed and hissed
and yelled, "You sold out.

576
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,782
"The music belongs to the people.

577
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,619
"Let's bring the walls down.

578
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:31,457
"We're sitting here in our own shit
and you're back there in your Rolls Royce. "

579
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,588
None of this capitalist shit!
Open the door.

580
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,397
The music isn't revolutionary at all.

581
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,265
It's called big business.

582
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,772
It's a big business trip, that's all.

583
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,070
And if you've come to this country...

584
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,377
at our invitation...

585
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:52,547
and we have to charge you,
through no choice of our own...

586
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,083
¡ê3, right?

587
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,717
If you don't wanna pay it,
don't fucking well come!

588
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,720
Listen a minute, will you?

589
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,386
Will you listen a minute?

590
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:12,433
Now, listen. A lot of people
who get up here and sing....

591
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,767
I know it's fun, you know.

592
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,774
It's fun for me. I get my feelings off
through my music.

593
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:23,205
But listen, you got your life
wrapped up in it...

594
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,376
and it's very difficult to come out here
and lay something down when people....

595
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,011
I think that you're acting
like tourists, man.

596
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,918
Give us some respect.

597
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,976
I believe this is my festival!

598
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,707
-lf I was allowed to go onstage...
-Listen to me.

599
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:03,116
...we may have discovered I'm one of
the most coherent people around...

600
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,347
Settle down.

601
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,515
...coming to talk to an old friend of mine,
Joni Mitchell.

602
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:11,822
"We are stardust
We are golden

603
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,092
"We've got to get ourselves
Back to the Garden"

604
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:24,264
It was really a moment,
it was like a breath there for a moment.

605
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,605
It was like an open door,
it was like, "Look! "

606
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,872
Then, bam,
it slammed shut again immediately.

607
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:44,582
Whereas I was a ham on a small scale
and I liked the small clubs...

608
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,061
the bigger the stage got,
the more isolated you were.

609
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,328
I'd been in the street too long,
going anywhere I wanted to by myself...

610
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,198
too long to give it up, you know.

611
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,296
So the idea of being
protected and sheltered...

612
00:47:56,373 --> 00:48:00,867
it was excruciatingly depressing
to me, the change.

613
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,844
I had no designs to be a star.

614
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,547
Nobody wants to be
in the center of the spotlight.

615
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,175
Not in your life.

616
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,152
Maybe in your work, but not in your life.

617
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,882
You read about yourself in the papers...

618
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,216
and people that you're supposed
to have slept with...

619
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,387
hotels that you're supposed
to have burned to the ground...

620
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:22,762
and at first, you feel kind of violated,
and then you realize...

621
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,597
"Hell, this character
is much more interesting than I am.

622
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,727
"I should run with it."

623
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,935
This whole success thing...

624
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:34,235
it hasn't yet really compromised...

625
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,437
the position that I took
a long time ago in Texas, that was...

626
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:40,415
to be true to myself, to be the person...

627
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,417
that was on the inside of me,
and not play games.

628
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,887
That's what I'm trying to do, mostly...

629
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:49,618
in the whole world,
is to not bullshit myself.

630
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,496
Janis was the money magnet,
and I know because I spoke to her.

631
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:33,434
I knew the pressures that she was under
to be a salable commodity...

632
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:37,532
and part of that commodity
was what killed her...

633
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:41,007
because it had to be this tougher, boozy...

634
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,876
two-fisted broad
who always went home alone.

635
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:45,676
And she was a lonely girl.

636
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:51,614
She had a problem of getting off-stage...

637
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:54,282
and unplugging from the business.

638
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:57,122
So she began using downers and alcohol...

639
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,957
to deal with her loneliness.

640
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,554
She was without the community
and without her friends...

641
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,656
and with strangers, essentially.

642
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,344
Passing around this Dutch counterpart
to Southern Comfort...

643
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:24,649
everybody held the last swallow
and simultaneously spat into the fire.

644
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,655
There was this blast of light...

645
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,749
and I heard this cackle
coming through the smoke flaps...

646
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,590
and I think that was Janis saying goodbye.

647
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,207
It's an absolute tragedy.
He was a brilliant poet.

648
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,215
John, Robby, and I loved him
like he was our brother.

649
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,716
All four of us were brothers.

650
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,379
We were conquering
the universe together.

651
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,821
We were bringing a message of love...

652
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,882
and strangeness to the universe.

653
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,393
He's gone, and it's a real tragedy for me...

654
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:06,929
a real sadness.

655
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,964
When people talk to me about
Keith Moon, you know, the fans...

656
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,235
they have no conception...

657
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,804
of how much I hate him for killing himself.

658
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,472
I love him, but I'm so angry with him
for wasting his life.

659
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,407
That's why a lot of people died...

660
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,276
because a whole lot of us,
having been so disappointed...

661
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:28,613
in what life turned out supposedly to be,
just turned our backs on it...

662
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,051
and went looking at the other agenda...

663
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,852
the unapproved agendas.

664
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:38,384
Some killed people, as in any exploration.
We had nothing to explore but ourselves.

665
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,704
With the mass acceptance
comes a tremendous fear of subversion...

666
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,243
either from the outside
or from the inside...

667
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,779
and virtually all rock musicians...

668
00:51:56,847 --> 00:52:00,180
came from the outside of society
in some fashion.

669
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,684
All of a sudden, you're the big insider.

670
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,648
Anybody can protest...

671
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,858
and anybody can write beautiful songs
and all that.

672
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,921
If you have a talent
or if people are noticing you enough...

673
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,696
then you should really try to do as much
as you possibly can with it.

674
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,499
Like, what we're going to do now
is chop down the words...

675
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,699
and try to make it really tight...

676
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:28,471
and what we're saying is not protesting
but giving the answers...

677
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,410
or some kind of solution...

678
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,873
instead of going towards the negative.

679
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:36,441
Jimi was quite an interesting man...

680
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,114
completely different than his public image.

681
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:42,647
He was supposed to be this wild man,
when in fact he was very gentle...

682
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:45,160
very introspective, very bright man.

683
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,561
One of the greatest musicians
I'll ever have the pleasure of knowing.

684
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:18,251
Our last gig together was the Isle of Wight
right before he died...

685
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,262
which I had a big conversation
with him then, too...

686
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,925
about the problems he was having
in the business then...

687
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,401
and I was saying, "Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.

688
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,735
"We'll get together. We'll talk about it.
I'll be in London. "

689
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,672
And he never showed up.

690
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,486
Jimi was a great guitar player.
I thought he was the best.

691
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:48,584
I thought he had a really original act,
and that's all, man.

692
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:52,754
I don't know nothing about his business,
whether he was a casualty.

693
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,888
I wish he was still here.

694
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,796
Thank you very much and good night.

695
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,800
I'd like to say peace.

696
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,837
Yeah, and happiness.

697
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,879
How well would Hendrix
be playing by now?

698
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,074
What would Janis be singing like by now?

699
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,413
We're talking major stuff here.

700
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,784
Genius that got dropped on the floor...

701
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,948
and ground into the dirt.

702
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:30,264
Look at my life. Look at my generation.
How did that work?

703
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,530
Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones,
Janis Joplin, Keith Moon...

704
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,266
the list is endless. They're dead people.
My life is full of dead people.

705
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,241
My friends are dead. My friends!

706
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:44,405
They might be your fucking icons,
they're my fucking friends!

707
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,778
They're dead.

708
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,043
Janis and Jimi didn't have a family,
nothing to go home to...

709
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,350
a family, a group that could really
tell them what's really going on.

710
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,550
Here's what you really look like,
not what you think you look like.

711
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,901
If you look at the Dead and The Band...

712
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,469
there's two examples.

713
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,572
They're still together and we're not.

714
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,844
'Cause they ended up
keeping their own counsel...

715
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,045
and they ended up
keeping their family together.

716
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,678
In the last three years, I think...

717
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:29,350
the Grateful Dead have been
the largest-grossing live act in the world.

718
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,450
Amazing.

719
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:45,601
It's more fulfilling
to be a person than a personality.

720
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,434
Most personalities that I've seen...

721
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,579
limousines and suites....

722
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,444
You know, that stuff cannot hug you.

723
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,540
We were right about civil rights.

724
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,017
We were right in that
love is better than hate.

725
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,181
We were right in that
peace is better than war.

726
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,920
We, it turns out...

727
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,985
weren't right about drugs.

728
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,930
Free sexuality
was an interesting experiment...

729
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,466
that failed.

730
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,731
But when I think about the '60s,
I think of the antiwar movement...

731
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,238
the Civil Rights Movement,
the women's movement.

732
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,366
I call it the "under-the-counter culture"...

733
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:23,435
and the thing is that we're coming out
from under the counter.

734
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:27,279
There's a buzz going on these days
called new volunteerism...

735
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,944
where people are feeling...

736
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,817
they get to the bottom
of their second BMW...

737
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,322
and they find it wanting.

738
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,256
That was the point of rock 'n' roll...

739
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:39,159
to become a new tribe, to bring America...

740
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,720
into a cleaner, purer realm of existence.

741
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,390
You were raising your flag...

742
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,400
and you were screaming
aloud and together.

743
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,901
We thought there were millions.

744
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,268
There were only hundreds
or maybe thousands of us.

745
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,604
But you can't stop
a good idea or a feeling...

746
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,733
and that's what we had.

747
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:08,213
For, like, two weeks
in the middle of 1967 summer...

748
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,952
it was perfect.

1
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,151
The electric guitar defined rock 'n'roll...

2
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,488
giving it a sound that was
completely different from any other music.

3
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:05,757
What is it about the electric guitar
that has made it the symbol of an era?

4
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,864
To understand why the guitar became...

5
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,435
so much a symbol of a generation,
you have to pick one up, hold it...

6
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:19,000
plug it into a Marshall stack,
and hit a chord. Then you know.

7
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,041
When you're playing the guitar,
it's an extension of your passions.

8
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:33,456
The fact that six strings
can be used in so many different ways.

9
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,090
It's an extension of myself. It's part of me.

10
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,396
I think it's like telling a story.
You've got to have a punch line.

11
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,098
In some fashion...

12
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,665
you wanted to communicate your feelings
to somebody.

13
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,406
You know, what you had to say.
You wanted to talk to somebody.

14
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,609
You didn't know how to do it,
or somebody just wouldn't listen...

15
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,652
until you had the guitar in your hand.

16
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:31,144
So what would rock 'n' roll be like
without the electric guitar?

17
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,515
Without the electric guitar,
no rock 'n'roll. No way.

18
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,223
It is the complete entity of music.
You can play the chord or the melody.

19
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,961
You can accompany yourself.
It's the perfect musical instrument.

20
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,032
I was trying to teach this friend of mine
how to do this.

21
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,708
He couldn't do it, so I said....
Pardon the thing, but you have to say:

22
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,671
Hey, motherfucker

23
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,753
You're always cursing,
you're always praying...

24
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:13,314
and you're always making love.
It ain't "do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do."

25
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,277
There are about 100 million musicians.

26
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,654
Most of them sound a lot alike.
But there's about 100...

27
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,717
who immediately, from one note,
you can tell who they are.

28
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,161
When you get inside the note...

29
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,132
you immediately
put your fingerprints on it.

30
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,794
You're making your own individual,
unique statement.

31
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,288
Your sound really comes from within.

32
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,094
The guitars and the amplifiers
are an extension.

33
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,031
I really believe it's a God-given thing.

34
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,869
I don't think it's something you can just
chip, polish, and work on like that.

35
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,909
I think it's something
that you're born with.

36
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,582
The concept of a guitar hero...

37
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,586
I think, relates to the concept
of a Greek hero...

38
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,147
or somebody
who is somewhat superhuman.

39
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,216
A demigod of some kind...

40
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,694
who attains
a certain place in the universe...

41
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,028
and people look to him
as something very special.

42
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,077
Everybody wants to be different.
So the guitar hero is, in some way...

43
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,348
somebody who's done something
that nobody else can quite do.

44
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,589
When I was about 15 or 16 years old...

45
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,648
I could turn on the radio
and play along with anything I heard.

46
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,389
And I'm going, "Hey, I kind of know
what I'm doing here, I guess."

47
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:36,100
I remember Alex used to go out on a date
or something at 7.:00.

48
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,200
I'd be sitting there playing guitar
on the edge of my bed...

49
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,739
just jamming, learning stuff,
doing my own stuff.

50
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,438
Eight hours later, he'd come strolling in.

51
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,004
I'd be sitting in the same place,
still playing.

52
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,746
I don't know how to explain,
but the bug bit me, bigtime.

53
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,686
I think when the Moors
brought it over to Spain...

54
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,357
this thing that's sort of shaped
like a beautiful woman...

55
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,424
the Spaniards knew a good thing
when they saw it.

56
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,804
It's just as sexy as hell.

57
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:16,308
I don't think there's anything else
really like a guitar.

58
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,869
When I look at a shop window
with guitars in it...

59
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,314
I still feel the way that I used to
when I was a kid...

60
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,076
with his nose up against the glass.

61
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,654
It's just kind of like
walking into a candy store...

62
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,250
and picking.

63
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:41,400
The way the guitar smelled,
a very specific smell.

64
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,162
It's like smelling...

65
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,797
the smell of grass that you remember
from when you were a kid.

66
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,431
It's that sort of thing.

67
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,767
It was very intense.

68
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,045
I always wanted a guitar,
from as long as I can remember.

69
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:01,519
I remember seeing a picture in a magazine
and saying to my dad, "I want that."

70
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:06,024
I used to play on tennis rackets
and bits of wood.

71
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,220
It's obsessive behavior
of the very worst kind.

72
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,131
I got my first electric guitar
when I was 15, and that was it.

73
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,870
I was 9. My parents gave me a guitar
instead of a bicycle...

74
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,972
and I was really pissed off
because that's not what I wanted.

75
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,134
Eventually, I got one
when I was about 15...

76
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:31,081
and I used to put it on the arm of a chair,
put my head on it, and fall asleep.

77
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,081
It's just really gone on from there.
I still fall asleep playing the guitar.

78
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,591
I love that idea of the relationship
between the voice and the guitar.

79
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:23,101
It's also because the guitar can move.
You can move a guitar. It's fluid.

80
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,733
It's not static, like a piano.

81
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,666
And you can bend it, like a voice.

82
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,013
You know, you can make it talk, in a way.

83
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,495
Some people hang them on their walls...

84
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,902
or bring them out
like a fine bottle of wine.

85
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,905
I love them as works of art,
and I love the sound they make.

86
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,902
Mike Campbell and myself
really have never gotten over this disease.

87
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,245
We still scour the Recycler...

88
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,014
to find vintage guitars. It's one of my....

89
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:20,155
I guess it's almost a vice now,
because we just love it.

90
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,693
Do you actually play all these?

91
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
I play them and I cherish them.

92
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,229
This is at the top of the heap, right here.
There's no question about it.

93
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,674
Look at the flame on that one.
It's quite unbelievable.

94
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:41,412
This one is just perfect. 1959.

95
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,674
-How much is it?
-Just listen for a minute.

96
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,152
-The sustain, listen to it.
-I'm not hearing anything.

97
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,252
You would, though, if it were playing.

98
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,884
Now, this is special, too. Look.

99
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,186
It's still got the old tagger on it, see?
Never even played it.

100
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,424
-You just bought it and--
-Don't touch it.

101
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,626
I wasn't gonna touch it.
I was just pointing at it.

102
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,670
-Don't point, even.
-Don't even point?

103
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,264
-No. It can't be played. Never.
-Can I look at it?

104
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,608
No. You've seen enough of that one.

105
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,346
The electric guitar dates from the 1930s...

106
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,816
when acoustic instruments
were first wired for sound.

107
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,749
Soon, two inventors,
Leo Fender and Les Paul...

108
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,391
were experimenting
with new types of guitars...

109
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,193
that could cleanly amplify
a plucked string, even at a high volume.

110
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,460
To the big beat of jump and blues bands...

111
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,401
their electrified instruments
added an equally big noise...

112
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,269
that became synonymous
with rock 'n'roll.

113
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,781
It was 194 1.

114
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,320
I had been deep into experimenting...

115
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,620
with semi-solid-bodied guitars.

116
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,122
I finally said:

117
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,589
"For once and for all,
I'm gonna prove the point."

118
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,929
And I would proceed to build...

119
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:14,272
this solid body, which I called a "log,"
an electric guitar.

120
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,872
The wings, I just hitched on here
with this little bracket.

121
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,708
I put this thing together
and went in there, and nobody noticed...

122
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,677
that I was playing a solid-body guitar.

123
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,479
And they loved it. By 1950...

124
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,595
the Gibson people said,
"Les, can you come to Chicago?

125
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,527
"We want to do something
about this electric guitar. "

126
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,858
I didn't realize the electric guitar...

127
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,695
was about to become a monster.

128
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,233
It's a weapon, really...

129
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:20,101
above everything else. It was a weapon...

130
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,764
which had a number of different values.

131
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,605
The loudness of it was very important.

132
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,948
The gun-like thing of it,
the feeling of it, was very important.

133
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,566
I remember seeing Townshend playing...

134
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,407
and doing these great windmills
and jumping up in the air.

135
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,873
Rock 'n'roll is as physical
as it is anything else.

136
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,281
So the idea of jumping around,
or rolling around...

137
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,912
or whatever you want to do,
set your guitar on fire...

138
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,446
those are really all avenues to be explored.

139
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,124
The first time I saw the Stones play...

140
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,963
we were behind the curtain
at the St. Mary's Ballroom in Putney.

141
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,868
We'd warmed the audience up.
The Stones were about to go on...

142
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,435
and Keith Richards was limbering up.

143
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,567
He was getting down on his knees
and getting his blood going.

144
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,943
One of the things that he did
is he went like that with his arms.

145
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,778
And as he was doing that,
the curtain opened...

146
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,013
and he continued to do it
as the curtain opened.

147
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,585
So, for about a year,
I thought I was just copying my hero.

148
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,649
Literally, just copying.

149
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,192
Meanwhile, I then saw the Stones
two or three times more...

150
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,925
and Keith wasn't doing it.
I went up to him and said:

151
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,593
"Do you mind that I copied...

152
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,100
"your arm-swinging technique?"

153
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,571
He looked at me like I was a germ...

154
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,905
and I realized that
he didn't remember doing it.

155
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,703
So I kept it in my act.

156
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,909
It was very much an act,
but it did actually, in the end...

157
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:16,318
become a part of a guitar style
which produced a sound that was unique.

158
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,789
It's like when you learn to talk...

159
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,993
you imitate your parents.
That's what you do.

160
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,397
When you learn to play guitar,
you start by imitating other people.

161
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,162
I don't think there is another way.

162
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,899
Anything you ever heard
comes out in what you play.

163
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,108
So there's no way that it's actually yours.

164
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,805
You're just a sponge that sucks it up.

165
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,906
And you put out bits
and don't even know how it gets there.

166
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,919
In the '50s,
a generation of young musicians...

167
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,150
discovered the electric guitar.

168
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,784
By plugging in
and playing blues and country licks...

169
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,828
they created rockabilly.

170
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,301
Country music was very simple.
It usually had three or four chords.

171
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,275
Elvis Presley walked right in and said:

172
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:16,007
"Okay, I'm a country boy, but I want rock.
I want guys that play hard."

173
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,016
So rockabilly...

174
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,749
which was taking country music...

175
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,347
and giving it a very strong,
very straight-ahead beat...

176
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,888
ended up coming out like....

177
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,817
The first time I actually heard
Scotty Moore playing...

178
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:57,014
was on the record Elvis recorded,
Blue Moon of Kentucky.

179
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,882
And his sound
was very unique at that time...

180
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,985
because he was using an echo amp.

181
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,974
playing the fingerstyle with a lot of reverb
and using the echo amp.

182
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,652
A guy like Elvis Presley, Ricky Nelson,
or James Burton....

183
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,786
That guy's a stone country guitar player,
but he rocks it, man. It's so solid.

184
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,888
Jimmy Burton was an absolute
groundbreaker as a player.

185
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:55,511
When I went to work with Ricky Nelson,
we recorded a song called Hello Mary Lou.

186
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,448
I get an awful lot of questions
about that solo I played.

187
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,797
My style was created at a very early age.

188
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,705
I'll demonstrate that with maybe
a two-string, chicken-picking sound.

189
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,760
I don't consider it rockabilly.

190
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:53,032
I took country and rhythm and blues
and mixed it together...

191
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,665
and came out with
more of a rock 'n' roll feel.

192
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,909
Then you got a guy like Chuck Berry,
who basically...

193
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:04,546
dropped into the scene,
wrote 35 songs in four years, all classics...

194
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,947
and invented a style of guitar playing
that, to this day...

195
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,616
everybody sort of has to pass through
the Chuck Berry portal...

196
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,556
to get to the next step.

197
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,785
Johnny B. Goode knocked me out.

198
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,122
It floored me.

199
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,022
That's when I knew what I wanted to do.

200
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,911
I learned to play guitar
from those Chuck Berry records.

201
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,244
-I wore a lot of those out.
-A lot of people did.

202
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,292
It wasn't typical r & b...

203
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,026
but yet here was this
different style of guitar.

204
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,726
And Chuck played horn riffs on his guitar.

205
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,163
Those early guitar licks were nothing
in the world but borrowed blues licks...

206
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,322
that we just speeded up.

207
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:13,228
The thing that attracted me mainly
to these early records...

208
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,403
certainly the sort of...

209
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:21,478
rock 'n' roll, and blues records
of that '50s period...

210
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,507
was the atmosphere that was on them.

211
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,377
And you could hear that
there was so much urgency going on...

212
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,988
and, certainly with the blues,
this sort of raw emotion.

213
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:36,623
As soon as the electric guitar
became a feasible instrument...

214
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,720
and became affordable enough...

215
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,322
the blues guys
latched on to it immediately...

216
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,425
because then their partner...

217
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,929
could now sing and speak...

218
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,406
with the same power
and the same strength...

219
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,466
that their own voice could.

220
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,104
Since most rock 'n'roll style...

221
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,774
in terms of the guitar, has blues roots...

222
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,307
that marriage just keeps getting
stronger and stronger.

223
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:19,525
You don't have the giant chord structures
to work with...

224
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:24,058
and build these architectural music pieces.

225
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,638
You have a 12-bar, three chord change.

226
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,667
That doesn't give you much
to hide behind.

227
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,075
I mean, you have to put your heart
right up front...

228
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,340
or you don't have anything
but three little chords.

229
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,352
So you start realizing how subtly genius...

230
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,315
these old players really were.

231
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:56,464
The blues is sort of like Southern cooking.

232
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:01,404
It may not have all of the ingredients
that jazz would have...

233
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,038
that rock 'n'roll would have.

234
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,777
You only have the three chord changes.

235
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,009
So you got to be a very good chef...

236
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,508
to put each one of those in the right place.

237
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,782
T-Bone Walker was the first guy...

238
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,115
that I ever saw play the guitar.

239
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,911
The guitar seemed to sing with him...

240
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,285
and I heard things like this....

241
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:55,143
This guy could jump up and do a split,
one leg this way, the other back there...

242
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,347
and still have the guitar up there.

243
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,186
I never did try that,
but I did put the guitar up there.

244
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,022
But trying that split, I didn't make it.

245
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,323
I was so crazy about it.

246
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,292
That's the way I am with the guitar.

247
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,705
"It probably wouldn't
sound right for me, anyhow."

248
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,572
So I go the economy way.

249
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,004
Try to make it sound like, you know....

250
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,114
If I'm singing, I hear myself.

251
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,817
When I'm not singing, I'm playing.

252
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,492
I think that,
had it not been for the British rockers...

253
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,331
and then starting here in the U.S...

254
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,135
with the kids starting here, and
a lot of the rock 'n' roll players here...

255
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,235
that the blues player....
We wouldn't have lasted.

256
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,712
We wouldn't have had anyplace
to go or play.

257
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:33,239
We were only trying to mimic...

258
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:37,851
what our American idols were doing.
In a way, we were selling it back to them.

259
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,874
If you look at what blues music
has been responsible for...

260
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,884
the Stones and the Yardbirds....

261
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,754
They were all really heavily influenced.

262
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,739
The Yardbirds,
a British band popular in the '60s...

263
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,642
Eric Clapton...

264
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,220
Jimmy Page...

265
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,546
and Jeff Beck.

266
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,690
I have done other music,
after the Yardbirds.

267
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,496
Anyway, somebody told me
I should be proud tonight.

268
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,697
But I'm not, because they kicked me out.

269
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,303
They did. Fuck them.

270
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,506
But the fact that there was this reputation
with the Yardbirds....

271
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,073
There'd been Eric with the Cream...

272
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,087
and Jeff was out and about as well...

273
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,787
and myself. All Yardbirds guitarists.

274
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,794
It was quite a keen importance
put on this unit.

275
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,762
Audiences were really looking out...

276
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,527
to see what I was going to do
with the Yardbirds.

277
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,229
There were many areas within it
of what we used to call "free-form"...

278
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,831
which was improvisation.
And I got quite a nice little...

279
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:15,373
sort of portfolio of riffs and things.

280
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:59,319
With Dazed and Confused,
every night, it was different.

281
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,451
Obviously, there's the verses
and certain links which are the same.

282
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,927
But it would be really different
from the beginning of the tour to the end...

283
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,528
because it was a whole area
for improvisation.

284
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,699
So this is how you get the interplay
between myself and Robert.

285
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,876
Curiously enough, the bow came to be,
"Here we go back to the session days. "

286
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,180
But it was David McCallum 's father....

287
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,550
You know, The Man From U.N.C.L.E.

288
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,083
His father was a string player.

289
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,990
He said, "Have you ever tried
playing guitar with a bow?"

290
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,461
And I said, "No.
I don't know whether it would even work. "

291
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,328
He said, "You should try it."
And then when I did...

292
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,527
Io and behold, it became quite a feature.

293
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,126
The way that I was playing it...

294
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:51,294
was sort of akin to modern
classical composers, like Paderewski.

295
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,067
But again, I was pushing it every night...

296
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,699
to try and come up with something
that I hadn't played the night before.

297
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,167
Now all these guitar players
were inventing styles.

298
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:29,468
You listen to a Jimmy Page solo,
you listen to Eric Clapton...

299
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,409
you know who these people are,
because they have invented a template...

300
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,808
within which they work,
and you know who that person is.

301
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:05,438
When I first heard Eric Clapton,
I was shocked.

302
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,806
He was so good, so young.

303
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,773
Everyone was following Eric Clapton,
which band he was in at the time.

304
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:18,754
Everyone played a Les Paul, looked
like Eric, and wanted to play like Eric.

305
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,463
I tried very hard to sound like Clapton.

306
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,061
He was my main inspiration on guitar.

307
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,965
For some reason, Clapton
was the only one that touched me...

308
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,306
the guy that made me want to play.

309
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,269
I used to think
I could make any kind of music...

310
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,933
but the guitar playing
would always be blues.

311
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,669
And if I took a solo...

312
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,576
I would always make sure
that I could find some place...

313
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,580
to put the blues in...

314
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,382
so that I knew, even if nobody else did...

315
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,046
that I always still had one foot
on the path.

316
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,089
Pete Townshend called up Eric Clapton...

317
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,682
and they'd never spoken
to each other before.

318
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,126
Pete said to Eric,
"I want you to go to the movies with me."

319
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,165
And Eric went, "What? Okay."

320
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,468
And they sat in the darkness
of a movie theater.

321
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,038
Townshend told Clapton,
"I've just seen this guy...

322
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,878
"who's gonna put us all out of work, man."

323
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,813
Out of the blue comes Jimi Hendrix.

324
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,724
He'd kind of come out of nothing.

325
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,762
He just appeared.

326
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,401
Who is this?

327
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,964
It was like hearing somebody from Mars
playing the blues.

328
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,877
He was just a fantastic being.

329
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,674
He was, like, from space.

330
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,146
What he actually did...

331
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:35,549
was he did things
which were actually magical...

332
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,812
and yet accompanied
by these incredibly wild noises.

333
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,087
There was some kind of
strange alchemy going on.

334
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,119
He was an alchemist.

335
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,161
He not only played the guitar...

336
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,530
he played at the guitar, he played
on the guitar, he played with the guitar.

337
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,297
I mean, he approached it
from every possible vector...

338
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,838
that anybody could.

339
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,472
He took a lot of that
and made it into something...

340
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,446
by demonstrating
that there was actually such a thing...

341
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,950
as physical poetry in rock.

342
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,452
Something that was very close to ballet.

343
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,720
Jimi couldn't help
be jamming everywhere.

344
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,886
He'd go everywhere with his guitar.

345
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:29,160
I mean, the guy lived with his guitar.
He slept with his guitar.

346
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:34,735
For me, it was an act, and for him
it was an extension of what he was doing.

347
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,757
Jimi Hendrix had a beautiful harmonic,
like an aurora borealis.

348
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:08,931
He would hit a note, and that note would
beget another note and another note.

349
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:12,271
He was a master sculptor of sound.

350
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,170
He did so much in three years of playing...

351
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,035
if not four or so...

352
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,302
that he influenced every generation
beyond that time...

353
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,402
in terms of guitar players.

354
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,914
Thank you.

355
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,323
There's no doubt
that the moving of a driving beat...

356
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,359
is something that's very sexual.

357
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:09,431
And because the electric guitar
became the symbol of that music...

358
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,263
there was a strong connection...

359
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:14,202
between the body rhythm
and the electric guitar.

360
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,839
I tend to think of the guitar
as the instrument of rock 'n' roll...

361
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,776
because it's an extension
of what you've got between your legs.

362
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,608
People thought I was weird
because I would stay home on weekends...

363
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,151
on Friday and Saturday night,
playing my guitar.

364
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,155
But when I got good at playing guitar,
boy, I got all the pussy I wanted.

365
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,960
I think if you're looking for an example...

366
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:50,495
of this sexual being playing a guitar...

367
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,533
the first guy that comes to mind is Slash,
the guitar player for Guns N'Roses.

368
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:58,639
Everything that comes from him
comes from his guitar.

369
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,981
He looks at it
kind of like a part of his own body.

370
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:18,095
Often, a musician can do to a woman
what a lover cannot do to her.

371
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:22,036
I'm flattered that you're here after the gig,
and you're knocking on my door...

372
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:26,873
and you're beautiful, and all that.
But, at the same time, I cannot do to you...

373
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,135
what my music does to your soul.

374
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,580
There's something romantic about that.
That's part of the romantic process.

375
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,786
Your guitar reflects that.

376
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,687
We were talking about
Pete Townshend, and Jimi Hendrix...

377
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,952
how they looked at their instruments.

378
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,189
If you're willing to destroy something
that's such a part of you...

379
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:48,095
that speaks volumes
about your personality.

380
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,473
Who said I broke beautiful guitars?
Who said they were expensive?

381
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,674
Who said I really broke them?
What do you know?

382
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,782
What's it got to do with you?
My fucking guitar.

383
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,749
It's the brute force of electric guitar.

384
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:19,293
That E chord on an electric guitar,
it's just bright red.

385
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,868
I just always have this thing about notes,
that they're really expensive...

386
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,397
and that you shouldn't spend them,
unless you really have to.

387
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,391
If you have a great guitar
and a great amplifier...

388
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,323
I believe you can conquer the world.

389
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:31,226
Anybody seizes a Fender Stratocaster
or an electric guitar...

390
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,997
that's the symbol of freedom, choice...

391
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:39,242
a whole generation of a country
that allowed people to have free thought.

392
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:43,338
It's an incredible instrument.
It's an incredible symbol.

393
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:59,592
In 1994, three generations
of electric guitar players...

394
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,564
gathered at the House of Blues
to honor Les Paul...

395
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:06,091
and to celebrate the instrument
that he helped create.

396
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,448
A guitar is like an old friend.

397
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:29,788
It has been, many times,
like the only friend...

398
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,625
that was really there for me
and there with me.

399
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:45,403
This is art. This is not something
that anybody can do.

400
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,534
Go ahead.
Anybody in this room, pick it up.

401
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,477
I mean, it's not easy.

402
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,468
This guitar here is such a pal.

403
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:23,535
It's a psychiatrist.
It's a doggone bartender.

404
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,014
It's a housewife. This guy is everything.

405
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,450
Whenever I find
that I got a problem or something...

406
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:33,086
I'll go pick my guitar up and play it.

407
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,921
It's the greatest pal in the whole world.

408
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,376
English

1
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,408
The music in the '70s was
more interesting than the music today.

2
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,086
The decline of the Roman Empire
is what happened in the '70s, I think.

3
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,783
The '70s had a lot of good stuff.
Every decade has good stuff.

4
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,928
There were a lot of good contributions
that were made...

5
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,593
and there was a lot of crap, too.

6
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,301
There's an awful lot of disco crap...

7
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,466
and other stuff, as there has always been.

8
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,770
But now, I look back at the '70s...

9
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,836
and I find things
that were really very good.

10
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,639
The great stuff from The Eagles.

11
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,512
-ZZ Top.
-Stevie Wonder.

12
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,881
-Fleetwood Mac.
-Frank Zappa.

13
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,544
-Sly and the Family Stone.
-Little Feat.

14
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,019
-Bob Marley.
-Lynyrd Skynyrd.

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,647
-Roxy Music.
-Rod Stewart.

16
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,190
-Led Zeppelin.
-Marvin Gaye.

17
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,520
-Aerosmith.
-Bob Seger.

18
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,617
Elton John.

19
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,094
I started in the '70s, for Christ's sake.

20
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,535
What a healthy time it was for music.

21
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,473
There was this huge circle, 360 degrees...

22
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,670
each degree being a different
musical category. Wonderful.

23
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,508
And it just got to be more music.

24
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:58,108
Used to be, you had to be pretty big
to make an album.

25
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:02,185
But suddenly, there were albums
by people I had never heard of.

26
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:35,250
I really believe that in the '70s,
there was a great combination of fashion...

27
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,849
artistic sense, song writing.
It was an incredible time.

28
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,857
Musically, it just seems like in the '70s...

29
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,120
everything was an excuse for a party.

30
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,324
We're just having a party.

31
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,799
It was okay to have a lot of money.
It was okay to flaunt it.

32
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,271
Everybody had an airplane.

33
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,331
Beautiful women,
any time you wanted them.

34
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,741
Then came the cocaine.
Then came the booze.

35
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,176
-Jack Daniel's.
-Cognac.

36
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,270
Budweiser.

37
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,315
Don't drink anything
you can't see through.

38
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,977
Nobody knew that everything
was bad for you yet.

39
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,247
Or that that could cause you
to crash your car...

40
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,915
or you're going to have to go to
rehab for that one.

41
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,686
It was a great time to be alive.

42
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,820
The '70s was the time
when music blossomed.

43
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,619
So many different styles
and so many ideas.

44
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,661
The artist had developed the ability
to create an income...

45
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,286
to allow him some freedom.

46
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,796
It was definitely a fun time.

47
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:56,426
Lots of the bands that I was involved with:
Steely Dan, The Doobie Brothers...

48
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,527
used that time to experiment.

49
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,165
There were so many different aspects
to music...

50
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,438
what was being appreciated,
what was actually being...

51
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,069
invested in by record companies.

52
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,206
The one good thing about the '70s,
I would write 10 new songs...

53
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,719
record them, give them to a record
company, and they'd say, "It's great."

54
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,048
No politics or anything.

55
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:19,251
And if it did well, which they did,
most of them...

56
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,028
it would be up in the charts,
and there would be no political....

57
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,961
You know, "We don't hear a single."

58
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,364
That sort of thing, which they do now
a lot, to lots of people.

59
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,128
A band like Steely Dan
probably would have....

60
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,235
We couldn't get arrested now.

61
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,103
Because it's, "What format are you in?"

62
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:39,167
"Are you AC, are you AOR,
are you CHR, are you FBI?"

63
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,538
"I don't know."

64
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,794
The music of the '70s was very unique...

65
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,768
because it was reaching for origination.

66
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,804
In other words, you didn't have to....

67
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,433
There was no groups of artists
copying each other.

68
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,272
Everybody was reaching for
their own originality.

69
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,973
And so I found that
very interesting and all.

70
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,915
And also, the standards had not been set.

71
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,148
There were new standards,
so everyone was going for new things.

72
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,390
There had been enough time
in the rock 'n'roll timeline...

73
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,160
to be able to draw from that.

74
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,793
There had been enough rock 'n'roll,
the three-chord guys.

75
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,327
There was the rhythm and blues,
and the blues of the '40s and '50s.

76
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,634
There was the jazz era.

77
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,541
There had been enough rockabilly,
enough country music.

78
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,841
You have the wellspring, you can draw
from a lot of different things.

79
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,472
A lot of the bands in the '70s did that.

80
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,346
I'd like to introduce Led Zeppelin to you.

81
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,921
On bass guitar, John Paul Jones.

82
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,030
On drums, John Bonham.

83
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,371
Lead guitar, Jimmy Page.

84
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,207
And myself, Robert Plant.

85
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,322
I think one of the most exciting things
about the music of the '70s...

86
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,383
was it was a hybrid
of what came before it...

87
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,392
but it staked its own territory.

88
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,155
What Cream was doing,
what Zeppelin was doing...

89
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:46,894
was taking blues
and pumping it up on steroids...

90
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,803
and doing something
that changed the nature of the beast.

91
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,285
See, the miracle about Zeppelin is that
for four people...

92
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,688
to come together like that...

93
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,693
and this alchemy
that actually occurred there...

94
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,252
it was just something that had....

95
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,323
It was something that was,
you know, written in the stars.

96
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,525
That it had to be.

97
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,896
Chemistry is another one of Page's...

98
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,634
sort of, philosophical overview terms.

99
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,142
I guess it was just luck...

100
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,814
and the fact is that it worked really well.

101
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,988
Whatever it was, it was pretty honest,
a little devious...

102
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,320
and certainly not adverse...

103
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,226
to a little bit of thievery, musically.

104
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,864
However, we're not the first people
to have done that.

105
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,962
My vocal performance
comes from everywhere...

106
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,574
Ray Charles'howl
on Drown In My Own Tears...

107
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,446
or Wynonie Harris or Louis Jordan.
There's loads and loads of stuff.

108
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,178
All that stuff,
you throw it all in a blender...

109
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,619
and throw the switch, and you've got me.

110
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,337
I remember listening to the first
Zeppelin album, saying it was like...

111
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,895
such a great....

112
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,871
Like a breath of fresh air...

113
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:08,778
for someone to be doing something
acceptable, but yet so different, you know.

114
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,479
I haven't liked a single thing
that they have done.

115
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,317
I hate the fact that I'm ever even
slightly compared to them.

116
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,582
I never, ever liked them.

117
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:21,491
It's a problem for me, 'cause as people,
they are all really great guys.

118
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,123
Just never liked the band.

119
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,892
I don't know whether I've just got
a block to them because they...

120
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,129
became so much bigger than The Who
in so many ways...

121
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,503
in their chosen field.
But I've never liked them.

122
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,947
The bands that were alternative then...

123
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,315
like the Jeff Beck Group
and Led Zeppelin...

124
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,753
those were the alternative bands
to the pop bands, like the Beatles...

125
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,759
and the early Stones.
They were like the pop idols.

126
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,990
And then these bands
that would come in and play the blues...

127
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,795
and that kind of stuff, that was
the underground, rebellious music.

128
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,830
Now, you consider everyone's all jolly...

129
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,031
and tiptoeing around, stoned on acid...

130
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,803
having Woodstock, and all love, peace
and sex and drugs and rock 'n'roll...

131
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,309
and all that's great, yeah.

132
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,007
But for us guys, who were living in this
hole in the world...

133
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,776
it wasn't that way.

134
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,797
And Tony lommi said to me one day,
"Wouldn't it be interesting...

135
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,228
"to put this horror vibe
to a musical thing?"

136
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,833
And then we started to write
"doomy music," we used to call it...

137
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,270
of this death music, doom music.

138
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,379
I'll never forget when I got the first
Black Sabbath album...

139
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,319
and I took it home to my parents.

140
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,884
It starts with rain and thunder,
and it's all this demonic devil stuff.

141
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:06,830
And I can see my mother and my father
look at each other in amazement.

142
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,867
And they both simultaneously
turn around to me and say:

143
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:15,871
"Ozzy, are you sure you're just only
drinking the occasional beer here?"

144
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,586
I hate the word "heavy metal"
because it's like....

145
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,621
What musical connotations does it have?

146
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,789
What's heavy metal? Lead?

147
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,398
Where does the music come in there?

148
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,363
lt'd be unfair to say that anybody
who sings in the band...

149
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,431
thinks that Led Zeppelin
was ever hard rock or heavy metal...

150
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,806
'cause at least a third of our music
was acoustic.

151
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,437
To me, it's basically all rock 'n'roll.

152
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,744
Some people play a little faster,
some people play a little slower...

153
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,842
some people play it louder.

154
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,944
It's all basically really based on the blues.

155
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,424
Writing the blues,
different people write different ways.

156
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,124
But it's real easy to clutter up,
especially when you're going for...

157
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,497
a blues-type structure in the song.

158
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,095
If you want one cluttered up,
send it to me. I'll be glad to....

159
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,515
It's difficult writing blues.

160
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,618
It would seem like it would be
real simple, you know.

161
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,798
And you either get it real trite...

162
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,800
or it gets real congested.

163
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,037
Our band started out, in a lot of ways...

164
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,009
the way we evolved was instrumentally,
with the jams.

165
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,237
We did a lot of jamming.

166
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,837
We would set up and we would play...

167
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,407
and then we would listen to
Miles Davis, John Coltrane...

168
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,615
and then the old blues cats,
Robert Johnson, people like this.

169
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,055
There were a lot of bands that,
in the early '70s...

170
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,788
did relate to our music a lot.

171
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,298
Marshall Tucker, Charlie Daniels,
Lynyrd Skynyrd...

172
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,596
but nowadays it's not really fair
to call the Allman Brothers...

173
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,227
a southern rock band, you know.

174
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,138
Rock 'n' roll was pretty much
born in the South.

175
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,699
So was the blues,
a certain kind of blues, anyway.

176
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:09,039
And saying "southern rock"
is like saying "rock rock."

177
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,600
The rock-and-roll white boys had blues...

178
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,670
which I never would have thought
would be happening.

179
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,878
So we had to find a new music.
And to me, the tempo of blues...

180
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:51,286
right in the middle of rock 'n' roll,
that midway point is funky music.

181
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,348
It was not fast, like rock 'n'roll...

182
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,019
it was not all the way slow,
like the blues...

183
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,325
but it was basically the
same three chord changes.

184
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:15,346
We went back to James Brown,
the two-four thing and just a basic groove.

185
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,180
You couldn't define exactly what it was,
so we called it "funkadelic."

186
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,220
Two-four is basic dance music.

187
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,093
James Brown taught us...

188
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,860
the one was more emphasis put on it.

189
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,492
The one is like that.
You can hit it on this end early...

190
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,307
you can hit it in the middle,
which is what most people try to do...

191
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,309
or you can hit it late, but it's still in that...

192
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,004
time of the one.

193
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,005
We were like...

194
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:54,575
the last second, you know,
right behind the beat, but hard.

195
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,765
We did it to a point that it was cartoonish.

196
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,135
So we exaggerated,
you know, till it was animated...

197
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,935
and then with the costumes
and the spaceship...

198
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,672
it knocked your head off.

199
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,246
You'd walk around flinching to yourself.

200
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,129
In the '70s, George Clinton
and Parliament Funkadelic...

201
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,299
and Earth, Wind & Fire
were very serious about our music...

202
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,240
and who we were trying to touch.

203
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,007
I think that's one reason
why the music of the '70s has not died.

204
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,641
Because it has
a rejuvenating quality about it.

205
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,897
Bob Marley made a great contribution
in presenting us with reggae music...

206
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,495
and creating more universal
acceptance of it.

207
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,768
I think Bob Marley's message
was a universal message...

208
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,809
so therefore it would touch everybody.

209
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,805
There's nothing
that he can't sing about in those songs.

210
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,146
It's the freedom that I relate to.

211
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,089
He didn't favor no sides of a thing.

212
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,493
It was just,
people should be together no matter what.

213
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,387
What is your special message?

214
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:50,595
Show peace and love and music,
you know. And liberty.

215
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,623
I met Bob quite a few times.

216
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,465
We used to joke a lot because
every time I saw him...

217
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,665
he'd always have a spliff
with a big old brown paper bag...

218
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,732
and I'm like, "That paper bag
would choke me to death."

219
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,301
Never mind the weed,
but that paper bag would hurt.

220
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,387
"He wanted everything at the same time...

221
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,452
"Prophet, soul rebel,
rasta man, herbsman...

222
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,293
"wild man, and natural mystic man...

223
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,801
"ladies'man, island man, family man...

224
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,600
"Rita 's man, soccer man, showman...

225
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:04,005
"shaman, human, Jamaican!"

226
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,785
The '70s was a very significant time
for black musicians...

227
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,654
because a lot of things
had been wrestled with, you know...

228
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,523
and kind of settled
in everybody's mind by that time...

229
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:26,462
about having the courage
to just go straight ahead...

230
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,228
with what your energy's about,
and go for it.

231
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,009
To me, Sly was an intellectual version...

232
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,917
of James Brown and Motown.

233
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,916
How in the hell
can anybody get soul music...

234
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,153
to be that tight, until it's popping...

235
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:59,129
and still have as much soul
as the old-fashioned blues singers?

236
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,134
He's, by far, one of the most brilliant
songwriters there ever was.

237
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,671
He was a genius.

238
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,732
To be able to conceive of
all different types of music...

239
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,177
and to fuse it into one thing,
and to set new standards at that time...

240
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,340
because prior to Sly...

241
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,250
black musicians didn't sell a lot of albums,
mostly sold single records.

242
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,422
So when Sly came along,
he kind of broke that chain.

243
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,333
There was a concert I went to
that I'll never forget.

244
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,166
It was a Sly and the Family Stone concert.

245
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,838
The whole place was rocking.
Stupidly rocking.

246
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,238
I always wanted to have my concert
be like that.

247
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,881
I said, "Gosh, I'll know...

248
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,919
"I will have really made it to the top
when my concerts do that."

249
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,157
Stevie Wonder, "Little 'Tevie."

250
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:40,426
We've watched Stevie grow up,
even before we got to Motown.

251
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,396
He was so frisky when he was little...

252
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,595
and, you know, he used to always jump
when he was performing.

253
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,572
Doing like that, and we used to say,
"Okay, Steve. Keep it up.

254
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,235
"You better get somewhere
and sit your little butt down, okay?"

255
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:57,247
"I ain't gonna do that." Stevie jumped
one time, jumped right off the stage.

256
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,876
"Okay. Didn't we tell you
to get somewhere and sit down?"

257
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:22,738
The interesting thing about Stevie Wonder
is he broke away from the Motown mold.

258
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,700
He matured to the point where
he said to Berry Gordy:

259
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:29,338
"I got to do what I do.
I want to create my kind of music."

260
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,817
Stevie Wonder,
going back to Talking Book...

261
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,981
he was playing all the instruments himself
and playing synthesizer.

262
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,284
It was great.

263
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,832
Stevie was recording like 150 to 200 songs
during this period...

264
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,805
Innervisions, and all those great things.
And he just fell in.

265
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,307
I remember there were these two
synthesizer players...

266
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,970
Bob Margouleff and a friend of his...

267
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:04,641
and they had this huge,
monstrous array of synthesizers.

268
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,150
In old-fashioned days,
you had to put in plugs...

269
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,052
and they had cords
like telephone operators had to plug in...

270
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,819
and they called this thing TONTO.
That was the name of it.

271
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,522
And Stevie just did some
of the most miraculous things...

272
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,795
and from thereon,
the synthesizer became another child...

273
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,267
that was a part of the vocabulary.

274
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:30,774
In the '70s, the artist had the opportunity
to take the time in the studio...

275
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,402
to spend the time
that he deemed necessary...

276
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:37,505
to really do his or her art,
whether it was self-indulgent or not.

277
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,142
With Steely Dan,
it used to take me six weeks...

278
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,584
just to find a comfortable chair
at $300 an hour.

279
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,349
It was pretty silly.

280
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,351
The biggest problem
with recording studios...

281
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,988
is the surfeit of options.
There are far too many things.

282
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,764
Can I just hear the
new Mellotron sound, please?

283
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,400
That wasn't really
quite exaggerated enough.

284
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,304
There always is an oscillation
of attraction between...

285
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,936
going the whole hog
with studio technology...

286
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,503
which always goes over the top
at some point.

287
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,948
The music of the early '70s
was actually fairly tedious...

288
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,454
as a result of people suddenly
becoming possessed by the idea...

289
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,580
that they were symphonic composers.

290
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:22,457
What Eno and I found that was the most
interesting aspect of the new music...

291
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,893
that we were doing at that time
was actually...

292
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,625
working with synthesizers,
but throwing the manuals away.

293
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,167
So we had no idea
how the damn things worked.

294
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:34,194
It was the mistakes they made that we
found more interesting than the stuff....

295
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,708
Because these things are programmed
by hi-tech buffs...

296
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,745
who don't have any sensibility
of what can be done musically.

297
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,610
So they put in the stuff that they believe...

298
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,809
musicians would want to use.

299
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,147
That's the stuff
you really don't want to hear...

300
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,688
because it's like fake strings
and things like that.

301
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,349
If you get the wrong circuits going,
you get crackles...

302
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,222
and farts coming out of these things.

303
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,694
It produces the most
extraordinary sounds...

304
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,788
in different range of textures.

305
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,500
There is music that is sacred to us...

306
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,630
and that's what's caused
this attitude in the studio.

307
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,402
An album like Sergeant Pepper...

308
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,876
everyone thinks they have a
Sergeant Pepper in them somewhere.

309
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,248
But if there is a Sergeant Pepper
of the '70s...

310
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,184
you'd have to say that
Dark Side of the Moon was it.

311
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:34,357
We were thinking in the '70s,
as we do today, of making great records...

312
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,595
which means an album to me.

313
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,365
I mean, singles seem like part
of a different business.

314
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,442
We all believed in, or were aiming for,
the same thing...

315
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:48,411
which is perfection.
Every piece of music being magical...

316
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,374
and uplifting and wonderful...

317
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:54,043
and the lyrics doing
whatever particular job they were doing...

318
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,609
to that same extent.

319
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,817
So we were working
towards a common goal.

320
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,500
-Can we run back and drop it a bit?
-You can if you like. Turn it down a bit.

321
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,201
Dark Side of the Moon
was done at Abbey Road Studios.

322
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,440
At some point during that,
I don't remember exactly when it was...

323
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:27,144
Roger came up with the idea of making it
a piece about madness...

324
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,413
and all the other things that it's about.

325
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,615
I think that I tend to bring musicality...

326
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,286
and melodies and all that sort of stuff.

327
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,696
Roger was certainly
a very good motivator...

328
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,029
and, obviously, a great lyricist.

329
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,702
Roger was much more ruthless
about musical ideas...

330
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,137
where he'd be happy to lose something
if it was for the greater good...

331
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,540
of making
the sense of the whole album work.

332
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,447
He'd be happy to make a lovely-sounding
piece of music disappear...

333
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,951
into radio sound or something...

334
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,956
that sounded really awful,
if it was benefiting the whole piece.

335
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,218
Can I put this down?

336
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,729
He wanted to use the ideas from the songs
to get responses...

337
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,789
from people,
and we wrote out a series of questions...

338
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,961
and got people into the studio,
and we interviewed...

339
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,700
roadies and Jerry, the Irish doorman
at Abbey Road.

340
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:31,876
"Were you in the right and would you
do it again if the same thing happened?"

341
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:36,345
Questions like: "What does the
Dark Side of the Moon mean to you?"

342
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,822
And, of course, understanding that
Dark Side of the Moon...

343
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,825
was not yet the title of the album.

344
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,986
Or not, in as far as
anyone else was concerned.

345
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:48,123
They were actually asking people what
does the other side of the moon mean?

346
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,433
Which is why Jerry,
the Irish doorman, said:

347
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,404
"There is no dark side of the moon, really.
It's all dark."

348
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,242
Stuff like that, which, when you put it into
a context on the record...

349
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,144
suddenly develops its own,
much more powerful meaning.

350
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,551
For me, rock 'n'roll just means
that there aren't any rules.

351
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,589
It's just whatever you want to do,
however you want to do it.

352
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,420
People say it sounds so professional
and so slick.

353
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,893
I'd have to argue that, even today,
I wouldn't say that my technique...

354
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,728
or some of the others' techniques
were particularly in the brilliant area.

355
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,497
If you talk about technique,
we were really crap when we started.

356
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,064
We really were pretty crummy.
We didn't have any technique at all.

357
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,873
Like I say, it should be anything
you want it to be, rock 'n'roll.

358
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,779
If it's moving any people in any way at all,
then it's doing its job.

359
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,657
In the '70s, I don't know if you can
pinpoint what was happening...

360
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,895
but a lot of influences were coming
together and becoming refined.

361
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,902
And a lot of the groups, you would find,
would spend months doing a record...

362
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,270
which was, at that time, unusual.

363
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,807
And Queen certainly brought in,
I think, unconscious influences.

364
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,315
We were all brought up contrary to
the way people are brought up today.

365
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,907
We were brought up with all this kind of...

366
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:19,521
show-type music around us, and with
a lot of classical music around us.

367
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:24,221
So when we found that we had all these
incredible tools in the studio to use...

368
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:29,298
we used them
to make something which was...

369
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,365
parallel to an orchestral arrangement,
I suppose.

370
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:49,249
Bohemian Rhapsody itself, Freddie
would normally come in with note paper...

371
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,653
and he would write out the chords
that he wanted to sing.

372
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,352
Freddie had a lot of pages
of these things...

373
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,725
and we went, "This is going to be....
Take some time."

374
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,765
If we make these harmonies,
then we got....

375
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,733
We had this technique,
which we called "the sausage machine. "

376
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,362
We would sing a line,
all together in unison...

377
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,964
till you'd have three of those,
and we'd bounce it to one track.

378
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,542
We'd then do the next part, three,
bounce that to one track.

379
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,771
The next part, the next part.

380
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:18,247
There would be like three
or six or nine parts sometimes...

381
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:23,276
and so, by the time you've finished,
you had a lot of voices singing those parts.

382
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:50,111
If the '70s represent something
which became refined...

383
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,878
I think the best of the '70s
had the balance.

384
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,080
You had groups who were able to make,
in recorded work...

385
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,646
something different and special...

386
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:03,091
but were really excellent
at performing on stage.

387
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,752
So the two skills
became parallel, but different.

388
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,994
And certainly, if there was a criticism,
that people weren't...

389
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,435
putting as much raw energy in,
I think you had to be there.

390
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,530
It wasn't really lacking
if you were in Madison Square Garden...

391
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,907
or the Forum at a Queen show,
or an Aerosmith show...

392
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,312
or, you know, a Zeppelin show.

393
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:26,279
For me, it was very gut-wrenching.

394
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:32,081
When I walked on stage, I thought,
"Well, tonight I have this opportunity...

395
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,855
"to maybe reach somebody the way
that I felt like I was reached...

396
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,327
"when I was 15."

397
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,057
I still get butterflies.

398
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:45,000
I don't need any laxatives,
because before that intro music goes on...

399
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,433
I'm in and out that can
like a fiddler's elbow.

400
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:53,907
We had a mission. Our mission was
to go out on stage...

401
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,038
and make sure that we made believers
out of everybody.

402
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,514
You're on, guys.

403
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,607
Rock 'n' roll!

404
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,390
-It's gonna be great.
-No, that's not an exit.

405
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,825
-We don't want an exit.
-That's true.

406
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,564
-Let's not lose it, now.
-Where the fuck is he?

407
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,126
You know, he should be here.

408
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:26,509
You go right straight through
this door here, down the hall, turn right....

409
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:27,902
This way.

410
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,505
Hello, Cleveland!

411
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,425
You definitely get a buzz being up there.

412
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:29,102
You can very much get caught up in
what you're doing, trip over everything.

413
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,733
You got to keep one eye open
and one eye shut.

414
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,711
I always liked those people that looked
a little aloof and floating around...

415
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,876
and for myself, I got to dance around
monitors and speakers and wires...

416
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,511
and enough of the arguments
with people to tape it down.

417
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:46,079
If they can't, they don't.
Better for me that I don't trip and fall over.

418
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,954
You never know what to expect.

419
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:52,725
The strangest of things happen
in the middle of a show, you know.

420
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,091
I'm out there on a cherry picker...

421
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,966
that huge, long arm
which reaches out over the audience.

422
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,835
The times that thing....
It took half an hour to get it back again.

423
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,843
And one night it would just break down
and it was just stuck out there.

424
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,609
I finished Space Oddity,
and I put the phone down.

425
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:16,049
I just didn't know what to do,
because I'm just still stuck out there.

426
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,953
The audience is down there,
and all these hands are coming up.

427
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:22,117
"What do I do?
Do I do the rest of the show out there?"

428
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:26,061
That was the early days
of rock theater, I guess.

429
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,356
I had so many
of those dreadful escapades.

430
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:35,197
We were supposed to breathe fire,
and I really wanted it to hit the ceiling.

431
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:39,403
The ceiling was 40 feet up in the air,
but in my mind I could reach it.

432
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,173
So the fireball that came out of my mouth
was too big.

433
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,874
And on the very first show
that we did on a big stage...

434
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,043
the right side of my face caught fire,
the hair and everything.

435
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,852
I later realized that if I didn't spray my hair
with hairspray, it wouldn't catch fire.

436
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,586
Because the stuff
says clearly, "flammable."

437
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,355
"Gene Simmons, this means you."

438
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,827
Somebody threw a chicken on stage.
This was in Toronto.

439
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,299
I'm from Detroit.
I've never been on a farm in my life.

440
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,428
I said, "A chicken. It's got wings. It'll fly."

441
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:11,464
I threw it back in the audience. I thought
it was going to fly away into the sunset.

442
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,637
It went right into the audience,
and the audience tore it to pieces...

443
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,207
and threw the parts back up on stage.
The next thing I knew, it was...

444
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,685
"Alice Cooper bites head off chicken
and drinks the blood...

445
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,222
"and tears the face," and all this stuff.

446
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,190
That's what the papers said the next day.

447
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,717
I got a call from Frank Zappa,
and he says, "Did you do that?"

448
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,027
I said, "No." He said,
"Don't tell anybody that. They love it."

449
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,693
The beauty of the '70s was...

450
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,769
there was no MTV.

451
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,463
Not saying that MTV is not any good.

452
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:49,139
But if you liked a band or an artist...

453
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,348
you had to physically go to the gig.

454
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,915
So there was more excitement.

455
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,717
"I am going to go and see Led Zeppelin,
or I'm going to see the Rolling Stones."

456
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,781
We used to have
incredible acts opening up for us.

457
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,259
There were bands
that were great bands, you know.

458
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,889
And you gotta go and follow them.
When KISS opened for us...

459
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,331
there were flames
leaping out of the stage.

460
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:13,666
And there's us four going,
"How can we ever top that?"

461
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,514
KISS believed the show was
the end all and be all of everything.

462
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,350
It should be overkill.
You know, everything, too much.

463
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,548
Overload of senses.

464
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,452
The makeup just evolved.

465
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,255
Gene was crazy about horror films.

466
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,922
And he came up with this demon persona.

467
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:44,397
And what made it believable
was we were really KISS world.

468
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,069
They did that stuff,
and the audience loved it.

469
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,409
They ate it up. It was big time wrestling.
It's like, the spectacle.

470
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,472
We were, like, shaking our heads.
We're just trying to play music.

471
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,110
And we were going,
"What are we going to have to do now?"

472
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,618
About a year and a half into our existence,
we were playing stadiums.

473
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,317
It really exploded big-time.

474
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,116
That's when the makeup...

475
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,754
really seeped into
the American consciousness.

476
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,628
That's when we became
trapped a bit by the makeup.

477
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,328
We couldn't go to restaurants.
Our heads were wanted.

478
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,462
Initially, it was exciting,
and then it got to be...

479
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,897
a little bit, sort of, too much.

480
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,404
There were KISS movies...

481
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,506
and the pin ball machines,
and the garbage pails, and you name it.

482
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,575
They wanted merchandise,
they wanted toys. "We'll give you toys."

483
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,917
This is KISS. Each sold separately.

484
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,753
And you can put them
in any crazy pose you want.

485
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,590
They were the first band I ever saw
have dolls, have games...

486
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,656
have all these side things on.

487
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,134
I mean, those guys took it to home.

488
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,229
I think rock 'n' roll
for the longest time was boring...

489
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,742
especially the American bands,
who were fat and ugly...

490
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,534
and didn't really care
about their appearance.

491
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,809
In fact, I remember going to see
a lot of the San Francisco bands...

492
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,851
and they'd literally turn their backs to you
and play like that.

493
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,319
I thought it was the biggest insult.
"What am I buying a ticket for?

494
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,186
"I could stay at home
and put on the record.

495
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,656
"Why are you turning your back to me?"

496
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,650
Everybody was a little bit tired
of peace and love.

497
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,459
Everybody got tired of this,
and everybody got tired of, "Yeah, man."

498
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,467
Something needed to happen
that was a backlash...

499
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,800
to all that placid, laid-back thing...

500
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,102
and we hit it with everything.

501
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,740
I would like to think Alice Cooper
opened the doors to theatrics.

502
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,218
Our band drove the stake
through the heart of the Love Generation.

503
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,721
We were just a rock 'n'roll band
with a lot of good ideas.

504
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:24,284
It had a little Vegas, a little Broadway,
but it was really rock 'n'roll.

505
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,331
The average kid
had no idea what to think...

506
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:32,267
because he'd come in, he'd see the show,
and he lived in Columbus, Ohio...

507
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,533
and he'd walk out of there going,
"What was that?"

508
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,233
That was like a truck hit him.

509
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:49,147
I thought it was nuts. I was just
so blown away when he hung himself...

510
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,211
and he also had some good songs.

511
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:55,349
I don't care about anybody else
that pulled off the makeup, seedy trip.

512
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,451
I mean, he was, like, the first one.

513
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,292
He was rock history
for having done it in the first place...

514
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,356
and he was the only one
that ever has been able to pull it off...

515
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,129
and do it so it was really cool.

516
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,403
I played the part of Alice. I created him.

517
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,105
I don't know where he comes from,
to be honest with you.

518
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,876
I know that if they say
20 minutes to stage time...

519
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,776
everybody leaves,
and then I turn into Alice.

520
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:25,288
After that, for the next hour and a half,
nobody gets near me.

521
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,591
The older I get, the more that I realize
what kind of escapist attraction there is...

522
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,153
to taking on the role of somebody else.
Because I've been through that.

523
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,064
I love theater. I thought it was great.

524
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,831
I thought it was a way of doing something
exciting with the stage and rock.

525
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,073
The idea of a prefabricated rock star...

526
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,076
one that didn't exist, a sampled rock star...

527
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,237
I thought was kind of cool.

528
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:18,869
The time that I really put it all together,
and really tried to make it work...

529
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,970
was on the first tour of this character
called Ziggy Stardust that I'd developed.

530
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,674
The theater elements were...

531
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,911
somewhere between
Clockwork Orange and kabuki theater.

532
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,283
Just, you know, grab this and grab that.

533
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:35,314
A real ragbag of information that
didn't actually make any real literal sense.

534
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:51,533
In interviews and stuff, I would just
either quote James Dean or Nietzsche.

535
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,036
It didn't really matter because
all the ingredients that went into it...

536
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,946
people would interpret that,
and I'd agree with them.

537
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,075
He represents it all to me:

538
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,849
Excitement, space.

539
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,151
I'm just a space cadet.
He's the commander.

540
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,555
I thought, "Golly, what power."

541
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,815
I let the whole thing trickle over
into my life to such a degree that...

542
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:37,445
it affected me dramatically, traumatically,
for quite a few years during the '70s.

543
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,285
Yes, I have a kind of strange...

544
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,852
psychosomatic death-wish thing.

545
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,325
Because I was so lost in Ziggy...

546
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,658
it resulted in schizophrenia.

547
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,503
How much did Ziggy's death
have to do with his own personality...

548
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,106
or with circumstances
in which he existed?

549
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,079
Yeah, really it was
it was his own personality...

550
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,520
being unable to cope with
the circumstances he found himself in...

551
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,822
which is being an almighty,
prophet-like, superstar rocker.

552
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:20,057
He found that he didn't know
what to do with it once he got there.

553
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:25,301
It's an archetype, really.
The definitive rock 'n' roll star.

554
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,597
It often happens.

555
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,376
I don't think anybody
can really prepare themselves...

556
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:42,384
for fame on the level that we've had.

557
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,422
When you try to think about
what it'll be like to be famous...

558
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:49,550
you can only comprehend it within
the scope of what you've experienced...

559
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,151
or what you know to be out there.

560
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,957
It's so beyond that.

561
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,794
There's hot-and-cold-running women...

562
00:43:55,866 --> 00:44:00,235
drugs, alcohol, food, limousines, jets...

563
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,365
and you very quickly begin to believe that
that's the way to live.

564
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,109
We're pampered beyond belief
as rock 'n'roll superstars.

565
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,880
I still like to get pampered.
I'm not being hypocritical...

566
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:21,653
but not to the degrees that
we prance around and we're very spoiled.

567
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,785
Although I never tie my own shoelace.
I mean, never.

568
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,921
It's just not the thing done in rock 'n' roll.

569
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,624
Ironically, you become a rock star...

570
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,224
because you don't want to do
what people tell you to do.

571
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,896
It's the classic thing. You want to rebel,
to have control of your own life.

572
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,669
What happens is, if you get famous,
you lose that control again...

573
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,142
because so many people
are looking for pieces of you.

574
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:45,375
You've suddenly, like, you got friends
you thought you'd never have.

575
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,383
Hi, fellas. How you doing?

576
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:52,078
A lot of people show up...

577
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:57,655
and you have to kind of sort out
why they're showing up.

578
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,425
Yes, Bobbie Fleckman.

579
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:04,263
You know, like suckerfish, those people
on the sidelines. Lawyers, managers...

580
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,359
everybody's starting to call you,
"Hey, babe."

581
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,106
Everybody wants
to start advising you on what to do...

582
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,607
and I get confused, you know.

583
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,109
This is it. I got it. I fucking have it.

584
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:17,614
'Cause it plays off that.
There was this author a few years ago...

585
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:22,044
I couldn't work out how these people had
those jobs, and how they retained them.

586
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,782
Because such an awful amount of them
seemed to be such complete dickheads.

587
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,949
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

588
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,290
I'm your promo man here in Chicago.
Nice to meet you. I love you guys.

589
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:35,422
When you're allowed the self-indulgence
of being anybody you want to be...

590
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,967
and having somebody tell you
that that's okay...

591
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,658
it's very frightening.

592
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,070
And in a lot of ways, your art will suffer.

593
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,200
I think the '70s was the time...

594
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,268
when that danger
became most apparent...

595
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:52,782
because that's really when everybody
started making a lot of money.

596
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,681
When you have money,
it buys you influence.

597
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,777
When you have influence,
it buys you power.

598
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,785
Well, fame in the '70s...

599
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,960
it equals power.

600
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,825
And then you have the power
to get what you want.

601
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,565
So we used it to party.

602
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,429
You know, we were the Toxic Twins.

603
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,528
And we had to live by night,
and not by day.

604
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,936
And we slept all day.

605
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,270
And that was marvelous, and it was fun.

606
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,744
When I got sober, I'd get pissed off
that I didn't make love to all these women.

607
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,881
I was in the bathroom...

608
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,281
with this guy and that guy,
and this girl and that girl...

609
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,843
just filling my nose and filling my arms.

610
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,579
I really didn't get a chance to revel in it.

611
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,788
Remember this?

612
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:46,632
The torture of fame and success
and lots and lots of money...

613
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:51,536
is not a subject that's guaranteed to win
a lot of sympathy with other people.

614
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:55,200
It was fun for a long time
because it was just me and the boys...

615
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,646
and our jet, you know.
I mean, how cool could that be?

616
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,948
If you are a millionaire at
20 years old, and you're unattached...

617
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:08,958
you don't have any responsibility,
except to have as much fun as you can.

618
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,722
At least that was the idea in the '70s.

619
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,564
There's more of a social conscience now
than there was then.

620
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:18,362
At that time, it was just: Have fun.

621
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,009
It can be a very privileged existence.

622
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,477
I don't mean in terms of money,
but in real life.

623
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,777
What you get to spend your time doing.
I live a very privileged life.

624
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:09,376
I have always thought
it was my responsibility to talk about...

625
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,785
life as it is for everybody.

626
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,450
If I want to write songs
that everybody can understand...

627
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,857
then I can't be writing songs about...

628
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,892
living behind a wall in Bel Air.

629
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:42,017
In my music, I use a personal narrative
to talk about things...

630
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,813
that, in final analysis,
are more or less universal.

631
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:49,291
If I am doing it right, then they're not
just about my life, but about your life, too.

632
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,603
It was put in my mind very early on...

633
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:06,905
that you should discover yourself,
find what it is and bring it out...

634
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,911
and that's what people
will be interested in.

635
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,243
What you have inside.
What you have to say.

636
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:16,418
For me, writing songs is like collecting
or harvesting the residue of a life.

637
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:19,216
It's almost what happened
when you take your experiences...

638
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,281
and reflect on them,
arrange them in some order.

639
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:27,295
A lot of the blues players
came from very poor backgrounds.

640
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:32,428
And they had this gift...

641
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,371
of singing about the human element.
A lot of it was despair.

642
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,806
And making people laugh at it.

643
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,612
Lot of stuff came out of anger being
in rock 'n' roll bands.

644
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,979
It's how you do it.
You don't punch your wife or get drunk.

645
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,450
Write a song about it. I'll fix your ass.

646
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:07,062
At the time when we were doing Rumours,
there was this rather unusual situation...

647
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,570
within the workings of the band...

648
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:12,096
where you had two couples
that were in the process of breaking up...

649
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,904
during the making of the album.

650
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,741
So you had
all this cross-dialogue going on.

651
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,987
You had John McVie
and Christine McVie breaking up.

652
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,151
You had Stevie and myself breaking up.

653
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,520
Go Your Own Way
was a song basically directed at Stevie.

654
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,967
Go Your Own Way
was Lindsey talking to Stevie...

655
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,531
or not talking to Stevie.

656
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:48,133
It was basically, "On your bike, girl."

657
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,445
Whenever that song was at its peak...

658
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:56,077
that was Stevie and Lindsey playing out
whatever roles they were playing out.

659
00:50:56,286 --> 00:51:00,484
Some heavy stuff went on with that song.

660
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,131
The Rumours album
went way through the ceiling.

661
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:21,599
At some point, it became a phenomenon...

662
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:25,910
in which the sales and the success of it...

663
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,777
really became disproportionate
to what the music itself was.

664
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:33,584
I always perceived it as having
something to do with the fact...

665
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:37,787
that it was a musical soap opera
and I think all of that came through.

666
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,353
The emotion of that, the truthfulness
of that came through on the grooves.

667
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:46,164
The Rumours album turned
into a freak, really.

668
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:55,039
"Well, how much money have you made?
That's what, 15 million albums now?"

669
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,346
But we got through it
and then we went into a situation...

670
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:05,215
where the likes of Peter Frampton,
the Bee Gees...

671
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,449
a lot of these bands
were selling a lot of albums.

672
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,652
Big numbers that hadn't been done before.

673
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,750
Frampton Comes Alive
was released in January 1976...

674
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,190
and it became...

675
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,128
this gi-normous record-breaking record...

676
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:51,160
and became the
biggest-selling record of all time.

677
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,725
The 55,000 that showed up
today at Anaheim...

678
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,540
The 26-year-old Englishman
whose name is magic enough...

679
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,475
to have all these rock fans
standing out in the hot sun...

680
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:04,478
from 1.:00 in the afternoon to 8.:00 tonight.

681
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,176
There were quite a few boom years there.

682
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,913
There were a lot of people
who were realizing...

683
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:15,117
that you could make a ton of money
off of concerts on a large scale.

684
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,351
We were certainly in the middle of that...

685
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:21,488
until the bottom dropped out of that,
which was not a bad thing.

686
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:25,293
The way, I think, Frampton Comes Alive
changed the industry...

687
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,495
was that it made everybody realize...

688
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:31,007
that there were a lot of people out there,
more people than usual...

689
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,371
that could buy a record.

690
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,706
There was a bigger audience
than they'd thought...

691
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:38,236
which turned it into
a much bigger business almost overnight.

692
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:42,177
Do you feel like we do?

693
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,889
Yes!

694
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,549
Frampton Comes Alive...

695
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:53,528
was the first sort of generally recognized
multi-platinum album.

696
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:57,091
And when people realized
you could make that much money...

697
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:01,103
selling records, they became
disinterested in fringe artists.

698
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,265
People within the industry became
disinterested in fringe artists.

699
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,936
People started investing everything
in these mega-platinum artists.

700
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,812
And that amount of money
also attracted...

701
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,045
corporations that had
no essential interest in music.

702
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,948
They had only interest
in money-producing enterprises...

703
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,453
of any kind. Gulf and Western
started buying up record companies...

704
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,755
and record companies started being run
from accounting offices...

705
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:26,625
rather than from A & R offices.

706
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:31,599
Definitely it was a new game,
as you would say, a new ball game.

707
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,872
There was the corporate thing in the '70s...

708
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,147
where people were making
big stadium shows...

709
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,414
and the music didn't seem to be
quite as good as it should have...

710
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:58,484
or it didn't seem to be being made
for quite the right reasons...

711
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:04,029
and you were having certain things that
weren't so good, thrust down your throat.

712
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,432
Time to get records on the radio.

713
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,562
We have a shot this week.
The album is a smash.

714
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,471
There's such a buzz going on.
Out of sight. It is a monster.

715
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,431
That was the beginning of that.

716
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,842
There is this adage in the business...

717
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,679
that if something works,
run in into the ground.

718
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,148
Here are 10 Frampton albums for jocks.

719
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,549
There are very few moves
in popular music now...

720
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:28,250
which haven't already been plotted out
and considered...

721
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,391
by some major corporation
who will put the money behind them.

722
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,122
There are not many accidents.

723
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:36,359
They got to the point to where
they were putting things on you...

724
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,924
to measure your heartbeat
to see what songs would work.

725
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,368
When you try to do music like that...

726
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,929
and put it on the assembly line
as a commodity...

727
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,269
it changes every time.

728
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,807
Up until that live album came out...

729
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:53,938
I'd always just sat down, wherever I was,
wherever I'd gone to write...

730
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,548
and written for myself.

731
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,085
I knew I had to write an album...

732
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:04,522
but I was basically writing stuff
for my own enjoyment.

733
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:10,397
Then Frampton Comes Alive comes along,
and I go, "What do they want now?"

734
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:15,197
And all of a sudden, the way I was thinking
about writing changed.

735
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:18,399
There was a pressure to write
for other people instead of myself.

736
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,670
The only way artists...

737
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:24,478
can do things is to do it for themselves...

738
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,779
and trying to second-guess...

739
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:31,483
what the public wants or likes
is kind of a fool's game.

740
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,189
Thank you.

741
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,159
When you got to the '70s...

742
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:45,329
ourselves, Earth, Wind & Fire,
Sly and the Family Stone...

743
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,336
who was an influence on all of us...

744
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:51,238
had music where you can dance,
and it was still rock 'n' roll.

745
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,044
It was dance music.
So we went on and on...

746
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,306
and as the funk bands
started coming out...

747
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,713
they really started dancing, and that
became money for the companies.

748
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,275
The companies tried to isolate...

749
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:08,253
the part of the record that worked,
that made you dance.

750
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,418
So your first notion
is that it's a drumbeat...

751
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,091
but the mistake
is that it's not one drumbeat.

752
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,761
When they started isolating
it to one drumbeat and one sound...

753
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,302
don't nothing get on your nerves...

754
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:24,670
more than some rhythmic
that's the same thing over and over again.

755
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,201
It's like making love with one stroke.

756
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,036
To tell you the facts, that is.

757
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,814
The machine age took its revenge,
I think, on music...

758
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:42,847
and disco music became the antithesis
of what music used to be...

759
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,325
which was a way to communicate.

760
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:47,227
The music, instead of being an anthem...

761
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,857
or instead of being a voice,
became an accompaniment.

762
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,695
It was almost the anthem of alienation.

763
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,397
Halls were full of people
who were mindlessly dancing...

764
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,170
to a rhythm that was basically a machine.

765
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:14,086
I think that it was kind of hard
for the white people to get into...

766
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,518
R & B music because
the beat is so sophisticated...

767
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,028
and hard for...

768
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:24,059
the kind of dancing
that the white people are used to doing.

769
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,529
This clearly defined beat
that is so apparent in disco music...

770
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,872
now makes it easier to learn
to do our kind of dancing.

771
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,747
There you go. Right foot on front.

772
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,883
Right foot, left foot.

773
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:43,979
Having fun?

774
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,852
Most rock 'n' rollers that I knew
had a real problem with disco.

775
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,688
I like a lot of disco music,
but I detest most of it.

776
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,523
I really hate disco.

777
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,961
I just remember disco
and hating it so much.

778
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,625
Number one:
You could do it all on machines...

779
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,033
so you didn't need any people,
and that put a lot of people out of work.

780
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:04,073
The record companies
wouldn't give us a second look...

781
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:08,837
so we really didn't have any choice...

782
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:11,210
other than play disco music...

783
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,840
and we weren't about to do that.

784
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,976
Disco got so big and it was generic.

785
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,953
The record companies
didn't have to deal with the personality.

786
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,990
They didn't have to give big contracts...

787
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,321
like they had to do
with the rock 'n' rollers.

788
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,724
They made it real big.

789
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:25,954
With rock 'n' roll...

790
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,726
there was a drastic,
violent reaction to disco.

791
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,836
A huge box containing thousands
of disco records was blown up.

792
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,767
We are free again.

793
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,536
Fans stormed out onto the field
in the thousands.

794
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,205
Disco records were hurled like Frisbees.
Bonfires were set.

795
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,269
Fistfights broke out.

796
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:48,350
Our goal in the '70s was to destroy disco.

797
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,818
We saw that as
a terrible menace to music.

798
00:59:58,394 --> 00:59:59,486
What you need, man?

799
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,725
Chopping up the old drum machine,
are you?

800
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:13,898
We have to remember the most important
thing about rock is the attitude.

801
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,446
Because, you know,
it's not supposed to be really good.

802
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,553
I think Petty is great.

803
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,861
Refugee was the most amazing
sounding record.

804
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,863
I remember kicking the door open.

805
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,334
The great thing about Petty...

806
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,804
is the simplicity. He's a great songwriter.

807
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:02,255
Damn The Torpedoes was very important
for me because...

808
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:05,589
in the writing I found a jumping-off place.

809
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,960
I found, like, "This is what I do. "

810
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,428
'Cause you don't know.

811
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,830
You do some of this,
you do some of that...

812
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,163
and then suddenly...

813
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,063
"Oh, this is what we do.

814
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,566
"And this is our sound.

815
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:23,472
"This isn't the Byrds or anybody else.
This is us."

816
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,223
The good thing about rock music
in my mind...

817
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:45,362
it will go for a while, and then
it will get very predictable, and then...

818
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,802
they're just bound to shake it up again.

819
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:52,363
And I love the little times
when they shake it up.

820
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,550
In the '70s, I suppose I was aware...

821
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:08,556
that there was a connection with the fans,
the people that came to see you.

822
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,953
There was a greater connection to be
made than was being made at the time.

823
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:20,964
When we went to do our show...

824
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:25,497
my idea was that the show should be
part circus, part political rally...

825
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,738
part spiritual meeting, part dance party.

826
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,575
You had to go back to the physical
in the end, I always felt.

827
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,673
It was like,
it sort of began with the physical...

828
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,685
and you're supposed to end
with the physical.

829
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:41,622
I have seen Bruce, yes.
It's a long concert. It was very long.

830
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,618
He's excellent, he's very talented,
but that was...

831
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:48,255
when he obviously didn't have anywhere
to go after the show.

832
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:52,427
He just played for about five,
maybe even six hours.

833
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:53,833
It was rather long.

834
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,370
That's all I can stand.

835
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,268
How I ended up playing that long...

836
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,737
I'm not really sure.

837
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,974
It sort of just happened.

838
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,106
I can't stand no more!

839
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:13,587
In the end, the idea was...

840
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:17,251
there would be
some sort of physical liberation...

841
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:21,928
and, "You get their ass moving,
and the spirit will follow. "

842
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:27,195
Also, playing to the point of exhaustion
was important to me.

843
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,834
The No Nukes show was a lot of fun...

844
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:38,380
and our slot was immediately
before Bruce Springsteen...

845
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:42,011
who was headlining that night.
It was his birthday, I think.

846
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:47,115
And people were yelling "Bruce, "
all night long.

847
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,257
Too bad the guy's name wasn't Melvin
or something.

848
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:01,527
"Listen, if you go on,
and you think they're booing you...

849
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:06,236
"don't get thrown because
they're really just saying 'Bruce."'

850
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,304
and I said, "What's the difference?"

851
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:14,774
The '70s for me was a time
when I felt really grounded...

852
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,751
in the music that I was making.

853
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:20,585
For me, that was the decade when
I was sort of just kind of telling my story...

854
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:25,184
focusing on what I thought that might be,
what it might be about...

855
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,123
trying to not make the mistakes...

856
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:31,098
that I'd seen some other people make,
or slip into...

857
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,032
not get distracted...

858
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,835
by too many
of the different types of choices...

859
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:40,433
and keeping basically
the idea of the music...

860
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:44,536
and the audience in front of me
as the essential thing...

861
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:49,551
and as this thing that gave
my own story meaning.

862
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:55,220
I didn't see myself
as some gifted, genius-type of guy.

863
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,191
I felt I was a hard-working guy.

864
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,096
I worked really hard at learning to play...

865
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:04,155
and I worked hard
at learning to write and sing...

866
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,791
and I always felt like...

867
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:09,167
I was the guy in the front row
or the third row...

868
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,729
that picked a guitar up and got onstage.

869
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,161
I think it comes down
to the performer and the audience...

870
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:45,207
and that's what it's about,
in some fashion.

871
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,536
It can be any room.

872
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,908
I've had great nights in little clubs
in New Jersey...

873
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:54,882
where you felt as alive and heightened
as in any big place you ever played.

874
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,409
One, two, three, four....

875
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,623
When it happens,
there's some direct recognition...

876
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,427
of some sort of mutual humanity...

877
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,764
and a good time is had by all.

878
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:19,764
I think music changed when
Bruce Springsteen came on the scene.

879
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,867
I think if it wasn't for Bruce Springsteen...

880
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,276
we may have gone
in a very scary direction.

881
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:28,443
We may have gotten to the point
where disco music ruled...

882
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,476
and then I would have had to quit.

883
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,890
My fellow Americans...

884
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:42,255
our long national nightmare is over.

1
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,993
In London, in 1975...

2
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,871
there was a sense
of the whole city winding down.

3
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,910
No investment. No hope.

4
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:21,936
Just a city in decay and a city collapsing.

5
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:28,250
It's like a wasteland with, just, nothing.

6
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,588
We had energy.
We wanted to go somewhere.

7
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,025
We wanted to do something.
There was nothing to do. Nowhere to go.

8
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,326
So you just kind of circle around...

9
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:42,630
walking underneath
those housing developments, projects...

10
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,604
and concrete, soulless places
where there's nothing.

11
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,240
A sort of hopelessness.

12
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:53,507
But we had hope, in a sea of hopelessness.

13
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,411
It was a very, very squalid period.

14
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,612
Massive unemployment.
Absolutely no hope.

15
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,247
Class warfare rampant.

16
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,684
Quite literally no future.

17
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,690
I wrote my own future.

18
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,663
I had to. It was the only way out.

19
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,656
The story of punk really begins
with lggy Pop.

20
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,162
He was authentic.

21
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,494
That's the problem with rock 'n'roll...

22
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,832
that there's not many
really authentic madmen in it.

23
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,838
I hated school...

24
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,771
I hated being confined in office clothes.

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,247
I hated the guys in the fraternities
around the college campus...

26
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,478
where I lived.

27
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,488
I just hated the whole American dream.

28
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,923
Iggy took the whole ethos
of the beat writer...

29
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,834
and made it applicable to modern music.

30
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,163
People would lay him side by side
with Jim Morrison.

31
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,675
I don't think that's quite fair...

32
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,907
because I think Morrison came
from much more of a European mentality...

33
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,680
where lggy was so totally American,
so totally Midwest.

34
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,880
Did the music of Detroit
have much of an effect on your music?

35
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,686
The industrialism in Detroit...

36
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:50,525
what I heard wandering around was....

37
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,065
-There are 10 cars, and so on and so forth.
-Sure.

38
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,397
I get a lot of my influence
from the electric shavers....

39
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,834
-It's true.
-But it's funny how those sounds...

40
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,840
you don't realize how they sound.

41
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,001
What did you do
to those nice people out there?

42
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,768
lggy walked on people's hands.

43
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,076
Iggy grabbed people out of the audience.

44
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,879
Suffice it to say lggy was a lot
more dangerous than Jim Morrison...

45
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:17,946
who might be waving his penis around
onstage in Miami.

46
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,482
You thought that lggy might take
the whole crowd with him.

47
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,067
I wanted to have my stuff presented...

48
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,036
in a much more shocking way
than the next fella...

49
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,235
because the next fella
was usually better-looking than me.

50
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,503
He could sing better...

51
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,137
and they could get a better gig
for more money...

52
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,182
but the reason they could
is because they would imitate...

53
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:47,049
the five most popular English bands
of the time.

54
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,762
It was obvious to me...

55
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,291
that person that could create
something really of their own...

56
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,770
that was the person
that was gonna have the key.

57
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,069
Do you feel you've influenced anybody?

58
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,576
I think I helped wipe out the '60s.

59
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,982
The American bands
that were influencing me were the MC5...

60
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:25,081
that was just a very heavy,
brutal, Detroit...

61
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,319
industrial rock ethic.

62
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,918
You were supposed to go out
and kick the audience's ass...

63
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,056
and everybody'd get sweaty
and gloriously beat up.

64
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,692
When I first heard
the Velvet Underground...

65
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,565
it gave me hope.

66
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,128
Here's a band
playing super-simple songs...

67
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,969
and the singer couldn't sing.

68
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,599
'Cause I couldn't sing either.

69
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,511
And I thought, "This is great.
He can't sing, I can't sing, let's sing."

70
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,655
When the Beatles
were singing Yesterday...

71
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,823
the Velvet Underground
were singing songs about heroin.

72
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,727
Singing songs
with real substance to them...

73
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:09,131
real stories with real lyrics
that gave you pause to think.

74
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,278
It was the height of the psychedelic era.

75
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,181
They were giving out flowers
on St. Mark's Place...

76
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,514
everybody was barefoot...

77
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,817
you brushed your teeth with LSD.

78
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,150
But the Velvets talked about real life
on the street...

79
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,684
and they played noisy, crude....

80
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,732
It sounded as if you didn't have
to know how to play...

81
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,131
to play what the Velvets played.

82
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:46,262
Obviously it's not as easy
as they made it sound...

83
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,807
but it was inspiring.

84
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,042
The Dolls were an inspiration, too.

85
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,974
Don't fuck with us, sweetheart.

86
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,140
The punk scene, most people think,
started with the Sex Pistols...

87
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,049
and the Sex Pistols defined it
in the popular consciousness...

88
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,088
but the Sex Pistols were influenced
by the New York Dolls...

89
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,181
and aren't ashamed to admit it.

90
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,792
The New York Dolls came along
and returned to the 3-minute song...

91
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,264
which is what punk is all about,
returning to the idea of a song.

92
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,206
A song that you heard on the radio.

93
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:37,645
Music you were hearing on the radio
in those days was terrible.

94
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,322
Captain and Tennille and all the crap.

95
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,107
I liked the way they were into
what kids really liked about rock 'n' roll...

96
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,267
which was:
"Do whatever the fuck you want to."

97
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,810
Offend the grown-ups and behave...

98
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,438
like the way a teenager
really wants to behave.

99
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,175
They were so bad.

100
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,614
When they attempted to play rock 'n' roll...

101
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,621
I thought it was such
a cacophonous racket...

102
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,786
that it made me laugh.

103
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,721
And their sheer audacity...

104
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,526
of being able to go out onstage
and deliver this to an audience...

105
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,199
I thought was phenomenal.

106
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,969
When the Dolls came over...

107
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,437
and they played this
really boring rock show...

108
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,971
-The New York Dolls.
-...wearing their high heels...

109
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,102
and, like, stuttering about
and smashing their instruments...

110
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,670
that was something
we'd never seen before.

111
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,943
And it was on television, even better.

112
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,044
It was wild and young and crazy,
and these people were having fun.

113
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,784
That was a seed that later grew, I think.

114
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,619
The good life. La dolce.

115
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,897
Malcolm was here and he
loved their style and their attitude...

116
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,732
and their aggression
and the tension they attracted.

117
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,499
He wanted them to come to England.

118
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,440
He thought if they played there,
they'd be a lot more popular...

119
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,569
but it was too late for the Dolls.
They were really falling apart.

120
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,908
Johansen didn't want to play...

121
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,541
with half the band
that was too drunk and stoned to play.

122
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:16,312
So not going back to anyone.... Malcolm
was there to sell clothes, basically.

123
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,451
You know, he was selling fashions.

124
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,853
And he sold rock 'n'roll fashion.

125
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,328
The best way to sell rock 'n'roll fashion
was to have a band.

126
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,730
Slowly I began to move
around New York...

127
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,999
and found a small bar called CBGB.

128
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,774
It seemed to be a scene.

129
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,136
And there was one character in the corner.

130
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,236
His name was Richard Hell.

131
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,818
And I noticed his T-shirt
was very cleverly designed.

132
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,647
Being a haberdasher
from the King's Road...

133
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,249
I was very enticed by this T-shirt.

134
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,851
Holes very carefully arranged in it.

135
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:01,163
And him playing this song,
which was his song...

136
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,358
called Blank Generation.

137
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,404
I began to adore the idea...

138
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,032
of new rock 'n'roll through them.

139
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:18,010
CBGB's, you know, there weren't bands
playing there when we started.

140
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:24,082
Part of my strategy was to do
as the Dolls had done.

141
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,250
Find a place where you appear regularly...

142
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,227
so that people can get in the habit
of knowing you're there.

143
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,163
The guy, Hilly, who owned the place,
agreed.

144
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,030
So we started playing there every Sunday.

145
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,928
And it was a wino, Hell's Angels bar.

146
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,174
It was just a dump...

147
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,408
a bar, and it's in the Bowery,
a skid-row section of New York.

148
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,713
Always dumpy and dirty and....

149
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,885
But at the time there was no place
to play your own material.

150
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,548
We liked the place right off the bat.

151
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,390
It had a nice, quaint kind of atmosphere.

152
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,396
And the acoustics were great.

153
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,361
There started being
this kind of uptown crowd...

154
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,564
mixed with a lot of dancers
from Times Square.

155
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,370
Topless dancers and prostitutes
and junkies...

156
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,443
mixed with these slumming chic people...

157
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,915
who thought we were cute and real.

158
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,790
In the beginning, they didn't expect
to make any records or make any money.

159
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,696
The whole point was
to have a good time...

160
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,395
because you didn't have a job
you could like...

161
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,370
you weren't gonna make
any money anyway...

162
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,464
so you might as well sing.

163
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,637
If Blondie was playing...

164
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,544
Richard Hell and David Johansen
were sitting there watching.

165
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,344
If Richard Hell was playing,
then Blondie and Patti Smith...

166
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,943
and the Talking Heads guys
would all be around.

167
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,284
I mean, it was all playing for each other...

168
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,879
and so there's a lot of pressure...

169
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,017
to do something better
and not repeat yourself.

170
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,103
It was a place you could go
and knew you'd see somebody...

171
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,572
you'd like to talk to.

172
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,109
The only place in the world
where you mattered at all.

173
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,177
You'd go there and...

174
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,741
like, matter.

175
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,650
By the time I walked into CBGB's...

176
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,248
which was in 1975...

177
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,094
I had been in the music business
in one way or another for 20 years.

178
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,755
What was great about it, for me...

179
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:50,598
was that it signaled a rebirth.

180
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,297
It was about reclaiming rock 'n'roll.

181
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,830
It was reclaiming rock 'n'roll
to a simple message...

182
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,947
and wasn't a big, bloated
corporate-limousine-cocaine-ridden...

183
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,672
bunch of shit.

184
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,178
What a lot of people were doing
at CBGB's...

185
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,454
was bubblegum and garage rock.

186
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,399
I saw elements of The Beach Boys there.

187
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:31,075
People thought I was crazy then
and I think people still think I'm crazy.

188
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,178
But their songs, they were all very catchy.

189
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,177
To me, they were pop music.

190
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,711
They were what was played
on the radio in the '60s, to me.

191
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,916
That's what I heard.

192
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,289
I thought they were
the most commercial band.

193
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,922
I was kind of shocked
when everybody said, "No."

194
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,336
Halfway through the third song,
I turned on the mike, and I said:

195
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,744
"What is this crap? What is this noise?"

196
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,612
I took the record off the turntable...

197
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,311
and flung the record across the room.

198
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,582
And I said, "We don't need this junk.
This is just noise."

199
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,316
I went and played a Billy Joel record.

200
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,467
I got hate calls
when I signed the Ramones.

201
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,972
They said, "You know,
you've got some nice bands.

202
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,611
"Why do you wanna fuck up your label
and sign the Ramones?"

203
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,078
That first Ramones album,
it was a fantastic record.

204
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,953
It was conceptually very interesting.

205
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,050
The fact that
all the songs were very short...

206
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,189
very simple drumming,
melody being carried by the bass...

207
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,493
the guitar
being simply this pulsing distortion...

208
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,572
actually became the English punk style.

209
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,669
The Ramones' first album...

210
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,735
was almost the only piece of vinyl
that we had that we could say was punk.

211
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,781
A lot of people I know
learned to play along to that record.

212
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,917
Sid Vicious learned to play
along to that record...

213
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,045
and Paul Simonon learned to play
really along to that record.

214
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,886
Most of the English bands really adapted...

215
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,450
the Ramones' distinct sound
as their foundations.

216
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,188
And then they injected their own selves...

217
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,633
to create their own thing.

218
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,800
When it got over to England...

219
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,669
punk became a way to dress,
look, and sound.

220
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,369
The New York punk scene
was very diverse.

221
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,011
The name of this song is Psycho Killer.

222
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:53,745
Going down to CBGB's that night
when I found the Talking Heads...

223
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:58,886
I was down there to see the Ramones,
who I had just signed.

224
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,621
It was a beautiful night in November.
It was almost like spring.

225
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,623
I was standing there with Lenny Kaye,
the guitar player...

226
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,632
in the Patti Smith Group...

227
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,863
and all of a sudden,
I hear music coming out.

228
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,846
I felt myself just moving more and more...

229
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,782
till I was inside the door and I was riveted.

230
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,660
I wanted to sign them
right then and there.

231
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,959
That night began an 1 1-month courtship.

232
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,369
When I started working with them,
they weren't sophisticated...

233
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,064
in using studios.

234
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,938
So I think I opened them up
to the conceptual notion...

235
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,104
that making music involved everything...

236
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,477
from the first note you play...

237
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,914
to the moment this thing comes out
as a piece of plastic.

238
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,958
Talking Heads are an intelligent band...

239
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,400
and ready for trying something new.

240
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:21,098
I don't know if that would have been true
of all punk bands, by any means...

241
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,903
or new wave bands,
or whatever they were.

242
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,842
If you're content to stay in a small club
and not do anything else...

243
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,476
then you're also not content to grow.

244
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,816
Part of the trick
is getting yourself out there...

245
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,649
"Can you make a record
and remain true to your ideals...

246
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,125
"and still sell those...

247
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,664
"you know, 20 billion records?"

248
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,633
The scene at CBGB stayed
so out of the mainstream for so long...

249
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,901
that all the bands were able
to fully explore their personalities.

250
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,703
-You know, including us.
-Thank you.

251
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:02,440
It was a great time because it was
just so spontaneous and pure.

252
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,339
And, of course, everything...

253
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,851
after a time, it evolves
into something else...

254
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,718
but there's always
these little pockets of time...

255
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,757
where everything just sparkles...

256
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,352
and everything is done
because people believe in things.

257
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,391
There was something about her music
that separated her...

258
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,993
from the rest of the pack.

259
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,401
I think that was the mixture
of the profane...

260
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,536
which was common in punk,
with the sacred.

261
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,943
And plus she was a poet, you know?

262
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,811
I mean she was a poet
in the true sense of the word.

263
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,681
She mythologized herself...

264
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,744
like any really great rock 'n'roll star does.

265
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,530
...spinal stars in the noir crayola field we
call sky.

266
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,331
'Scuse me! I tripped and
dropped my hand in his.

267
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,564
It la la la landed like an insect nest and...

268
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,574
all the red wire spiders jabbed in his
flesh like g-strings.

269
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,440
It was so easy to transform everything
into guitar strings....

270
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,475
...illuminated calligraphy. Everything was
something else.

271
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,609
A sound was a room, a spongy layer of
flesh, a trampoline....

272
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,193
Patti sort of evolved her poems
into rock 'n'roll.

273
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,896
In fact, what was amazing about her
in that period...

274
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:40,172
was the way that she would just go off
into the stratosphere...

275
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,769
into the astral plane.

276
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:47,241
She was performing in half a trance.

277
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:03,764
I met Patti Smith just about 1970.

278
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,697
And since Patti had grown up
in South Jersey...

279
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,206
and I grew up in Central Jersey...

280
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,606
we shared a lot of
the same reference points.

281
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,113
And at the time I was working
at Village Oldies on Bleecker Street.

282
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,978
She would come in on Saturday nights,
and we'd drink beer...

283
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,917
and dance around
to the Dovells or the Moonglows...

284
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,955
and have a lot of fun.
She knew I played guitar, and she said:

285
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,082
"I'm doing this poetry reading.
You want to do a couple.... "

286
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,788
We didn't even call them songs.
Just "play along with me. "

287
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,094
CB's was so important to us
for giving us a place...

288
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:44,199
to really understand who we were...

289
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,434
especially in the improvised songs.

290
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,940
Patti would tell a different story
every night...

291
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,313
and we would just follow along.

292
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:30,073
We would go around the country
and every town we would visit...

293
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:33,515
we would see little pockets
that would become...

294
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,076
the alternate rock scene in that town.

295
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,519
You go to San Francisco...

296
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,716
and Crime and The A vengers
would be at the show.

297
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,750
You go to LA, and The Zeroes
and The Germs would be there.

298
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,592
I mean, you go to England...

299
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,225
what would become the Clash,
the Sex Pistols, Chrissie Hynde...

300
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,495
they were all there.

301
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,005
And we all felt like
there was a real mood...

302
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,700
of not only us against them...

303
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,442
but a sense that it was time
for rock's regeneration.

304
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,139
We thought the rest of the world
will catch up to this...

305
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,013
and they'll realize what we're doing.
They never did.

306
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,679
And then, of course, the Sex Pistols
came along and buried us all.

307
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,261
We didn't know it at the time,
but all over London...

308
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,230
there was nucleuses of people
who were looking for something...

309
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,528
other than what they'd been given.

310
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,593
And we were all probably 19 or 20...

311
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,901
and we'd grown up
watching everybody else shine...

312
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:33,537
and we really didn't feel as if
there was anything that was our own.

313
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:39,210
We were living in a squatting community
where no one had any money.

314
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,947
So we just broke into houses
and lived in these abandoned houses.

315
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,954
I looked at the people I was living
with and decided...

316
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,083
that I could form them
into a rock 'n' roll group.

317
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:53,857
I was working for a cosmetics company,
Elizabeth Arden...

318
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:58,130
in a big glass building,
working as a computer operator...

319
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,497
and I was feeding punch cards
into this machine.

320
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,939
In fact, we were connected up
to the main computer...

321
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,204
which was one of these
billion dollar brain jobs.

322
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,673
We were all people who always dreamed
of making music...

323
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,742
but the right circumstances
never seemed to be there.

324
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,449
And bit by bit, the scenes have created
the right circumstance.

325
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,787
And one of the things
that drew us all together...

326
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,727
had a lot to do with the shop
that Malcolm McLaren had started.

327
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,028
Originally, it was a Teddy boy shop
which aligned it with rock 'n' roll...

328
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,127
and then they made it into this sort of
sadomasochist store called "Sex."

329
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:38,198
Basically, here was a shop
that was selling black rubber...

330
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,447
black leather, fetish wear,
on the King's Road...

331
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,049
to everyday kids,
who were searching for a scene.

332
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,745
It was the kind of store
where you could go in and just hang out.

333
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,122
I got talking to Malcolm.
We became kind of friends.

334
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,562
But I was stealing clothes off him as well
at the same time.

335
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,033
Some of those kids began to ask me...

336
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,798
whether I was interested
in helping them...

337
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,340
become rock 'n' roll stars.

338
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,305
I wasn't. I'd had enough
after the New York Dolls.

339
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,343
I really was more interested...

340
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:19,406
in working in this sort of
fetish fashion in clothing.

341
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,018
But it soon dawned on me...

342
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,715
that music needed to give it
some propelling force.

343
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,557
I used to steal a lot of bands' equipment.

344
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:32,057
He said, "Why don't you learn
to play some of this stuff...

345
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,121
"and get a band together?"

346
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,263
So that's what I did.

347
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,230
I was spotted on King's Road...

348
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,830
in a "I hate Pink Floyd" T-shirt.

349
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,000
I'd personalized it myself.

350
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,973
That, at the time...

351
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,748
I know it seems hard to believe now,
when you look back at it...

352
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:54,478
but that was just about the most
insulting thing you could ever do.

353
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,645
They were as popular as the royal family.

354
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,220
We said, "Can you sing?"

355
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,759
He said, "No, but I can scream and shout."

356
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,851
I said, "Come back to the shop."

357
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,757
And there was a jukebox in the corner.

358
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,356
We said, "Sing along to a song, then."

359
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,327
Actually, I picked
the Alice Cooper records...

360
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,498
because the rest of the stuff they had
was unbearable to me.

361
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,905
So I put the song on.
John was at the other end.

362
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,640
We all stood by the jukebox
and watched as he performed...

363
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,440
Iooking and behaving
like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

364
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,485
He was just taking the piss out of the
song when he was singing it.

365
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,758
I hated the guy.
And that's actually how we got our sound.

366
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,729
I couldn't play,
and Johnny Rotten couldn't sing...

367
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,030
and it created this horrible noise.

368
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,823
John Lydon's voice, just this big hell...

369
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,055
was the sense of exorcism.

370
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,230
The Sex Pistols were just blowing
everything out of the way.

371
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,202
It was an incredible roar of rock 'n'roll.

372
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,609
Everything that was going on in town,
it was completely over...

373
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,881
the second they came out on stage.
And I saw that.

374
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:40,321
That's when the old scene died,
and the new one began for myself.

375
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,195
The thing about the Clash is that...

376
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:58,265
they were a lot more experimental
with music than the Pistols.

377
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,507
The Pistols had their particular sound,
and they went with that till the end.

378
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,208
And we'd just try and play anything...

379
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,450
that we thought was good.

380
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,314
They were obviously looking at
one of their first loves, which was reggae.

381
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,723
The kind of minimalist aesthetic of punk...

382
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:22,426
had a lot to do with
what was going on in dub, early dub.

383
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,396
Completely destroy the track
and double and triple echo...

384
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,298
and that was dub.

385
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,638
It had that urgency
that you get from documentary footage.

386
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:39,439
You know, as soon as you see grain
on television, you think, "This is for real."

387
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,844
The white kids,
they never had any form of expression...

388
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,949
and reggae was a sound
that spoke about my people...

389
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,323
my problems.

390
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,956
It was both a protest movement,
underground, outside.

391
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,660
It wasn't the only rebel sound around.

392
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,170
Bernard Rhodes, who'd introduced me
to Mick and Paul...

393
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,232
he'd say, "Why don't you write
about what affects you?

394
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,744
"The dissatisfaction
among the young people.

395
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,804
"The way everyone seemed
to be going nowhere. "

396
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,960
We were tagged as
the more positive thinkers.

397
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,826
The Pistols would smash
everything down...

398
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,463
and we would come through
with something...

399
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,903
another set of values
or a way to be, to think, to feel.

400
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,241
It was a lot to bond you together.

401
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,302
Wherever the Clash or the Pistols played...

402
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,507
when people saw them
after they'd finished playing...

403
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,176
six or seven other groups
would start up from that night.

404
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,777
They were something
the fans could get into themselves.

405
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,388
It sort of said to everybody,
"You can do this, too. "

406
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,691
They played three chords,
it was good enough.

407
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:06,169
It didn't matter. Everybody was playing
the same Chuck Berry chords...

408
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:10,537
putting the new poetry on top.

409
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,978
On sale, 50 p's, from the box office.

410
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,156
It happened everywhere.
It was amazing, really.

411
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,025
I had no hope of a job.
If I did, it was a job I didn't want.

412
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,127
The qualifications I have
wouldn't have given me anything.

413
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,361
So I had nothing,
and the great thing was...

414
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,733
that you had a way of life
that you could tap into.

415
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,169
A music way of life.

416
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,367
You were actually creating
a future for yourself.

417
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:59,981
I was still struggling,
trying to get my songs to publishers...

418
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,356
going into people's offices with a guitar...

419
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,918
and making them sit down
and listen to me play...

420
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:09,433
and not really getting anywhere.
They weren't really terribly interested.

421
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,806
There just started to be a few rumblings
of things going on.

422
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,440
I used to read music papers
'cause that was my only contact...

423
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:02,509
with the professional business, really,
apart from rejection letters.

424
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:08,053
Sometime in '76, the founding of the label,
Stiff Records, was announced.

425
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,954
It had been a long time since such
a record company existed in England.

426
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,091
They're more or less
inventing independent record labels...

427
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,634
or reinventing them.

428
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:42,559
I took an afternoon off and took my tape
to this office in West London...

429
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,028
and there was just one girl in the office.
There was nobody there.

430
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,360
Next thing I know, they said,
"You'll get to make an album.

431
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,963
"But we'll call you Elvis."
I said, "Are you out of your mind?"

432
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,507
Stiff had this energy. They were thriving
off these things happening in London.

433
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,573
All this punk stuff I was reading about.

434
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,553
I found myself involved in a company
that had something to do with it.

435
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:21,131
We was starting to make some noise
in the music press.

436
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,726
We'd play at some clubs,
and a fight would break out...

437
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,270
and there just happened to be
a photographer there.

438
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:31,365
And they'd catch the fight....
There was always something going on.

439
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,172
I mean, something out of the ordinary.

440
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,213
Good Lord.
Now, I want to know one thing.

441
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,178
Are you serious or
are you just making it up?

442
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,810
-Shit.
-It's what?

443
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,887
Nothing. A rude word. Next question.

444
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,217
-No. What was the rude word?
-Shit.

445
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,928
We didn't know this was going out live.

446
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,486
Dirty bastard.

447
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,029
-Again.
-You dirty fucker.

448
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,558
-What a fucking....
-That's it for tonight.

449
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,931
The phones are all lighting up.
Lights were going on everywhere.

450
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:06,170
Malcolm come running out
as red-faced as you can imagine:

451
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,439
"Quick, let's get out of here."

452
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,480
The following day...

453
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,842
was incredible.
Every newspaper ran headlines:

454
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,653
"The filth and the fury of the night
the air turned blue."

455
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:24,559
"Call it punk, we call it filthy Lucca."

456
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,826
I had to go to work that day
and sat with everybody.

457
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,424
There were middle-aged guys
reading the newspaper...

458
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,026
with steam coming out of their ears.
It was really funny.

459
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,904
About the word "punk. "
It means worthless, nasty, jolly rotten.

460
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:40,569
-Are you happy with this word?
-No, the press gave us that.

461
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:44,580
It's their problem, not ours.
We never called ourselves "punk. "

462
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,014
It just became like the circus,
doing something to get in the press.

463
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,353
That was McLaren's thing,
to keep the media thing going...

464
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,086
and the music really
kind of went out the window.

465
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,386
One week after EMI dumped Sex Pistols,
A&M Records picked them up...

466
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:04,367
before EMI could get rid of them
and had to buy off the contract.

467
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,667
Here they were, signing a new contract
that could make them a lot of money...

468
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,971
and they already had a song to record
for A&M in honor of the Queen's jubilee.

469
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,410
You thought you'd gotten rid of us,
didn't you?

470
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,779
But you are wrong, old bean,
'cause we're back with a vengeance.

471
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,943
God save the Queen, my son.

472
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,751
About that time, nobody in England
said anything bad about the Queen.

473
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:36,095
There was this incredible attempt
to stop anybody hearing it and buying it.

474
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,698
We could no longer play anywhere.

475
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:44,040
The records were never gonna be heard
on the radio. They were banned.

476
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:50,609
We could take a boat on the Thames,
and we could play on the water...

477
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,215
a quarter of a mile
behind the Queen's flotilla.

478
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,555
The boat was finally surrounded
by the river police.

479
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,658
I was arrested and spent the night in jail.

480
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:08,665
And God Save the Queen
did become number one.

481
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,098
You cannot affect change...

482
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,611
unless you attack the very things
that are keeping you down.

483
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:25,611
The class system in Britain,
this is perpetuated continually...

484
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,510
by the very idea that
you have a royal family there...

485
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,919
and that's not to be tolerated.

486
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,958
The Sex Pistols' current record
God Save the Queen...

487
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,525
is at number one...

488
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,436
but the IBA, which administers
the Broadcasting Act...

489
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:51,202
has advised us that particularly
at this time...

490
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:55,211
this record is likely to cause offense
to a number of our listeners....

491
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,908
There was such paranoia around the city.

492
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,951
Paul Cook was violently attacked.

493
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:07,180
Johnny Rotten and Chris Thomas
were attacked with knives.

494
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,419
I, funnily enough, wasn't attacked at all.

495
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,397
We had to be careful
'cause a lot of reactionary people...

496
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,457
come out of the woodwork.

497
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,726
Maybe they just wanted...

498
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,601
to teach us a lesson, so they would say.

499
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,507
So, it did get quite heavy.

500
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,974
When all is said and done,
really all I've seen...

501
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,281
is a bunch of spotty kids being naughty.

502
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,417
Somehow, it worked.

503
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,556
We hit on something there,
not deliberately so.

504
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,429
Instinctively.

505
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,062
The album came out.
It was again a public scandal.

506
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,761
The name was considered too vulgar...

507
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:58,166
and we were destined to go
to America to tour.

508
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,234
It was Malcolm's idea
when the Pistols came over to America...

509
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,304
not to play
the typical rock star hangouts...

510
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:08,312
not to come to CBGB's, and not to go
to The Whiskey in Los Angeles...

511
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,411
but to come and play in America.

512
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,158
We played at bars that were
in shopping centers...

513
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,822
and we played someplace
in Oklahoma City and Dallas...

514
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,660
and God-knows-where.

515
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,758
All these places
that were not really at all...

516
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,565
on any kind of standard rock tour route.

517
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,567
But they were bars
that local bands used to play in...

518
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,769
so they'd play for these people
who wanted to hear rock 'n' roll...

519
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,904
and it was pretty rowdy,
pretty loose, and pretty real.

520
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,916
He fucking put us right out there
in the boonies.

521
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,077
You know, deliverance.

522
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,385
It felt like we were just like a circus,
you know.

523
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,756
And Sid was so out there, he didn't care.
He would fight anybody.

524
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,455
Can't believe someone didn't get shot.

525
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,057
I didn't give a shit
about the music anymore. It didn't matter.

526
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,761
You know, it was all about.... It was just....

527
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,932
We were all off the edge,
totally wasted all the time.

528
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,312
When you first go out on tour, and you're
traveling in a coach for 10 months...

529
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,475
and it's a shock to the system
for a lot of people.

530
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,883
Some people take to it better than others.

531
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,353
And others start having to take pills.

532
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,416
You're partying a lot and staying up late
because you like it.

533
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,321
When we got to San Francisco,
so much was going on by that time...

534
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,628
we just totally burnt ourselves out.

535
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,329
I think everyone had had enough by that
time, that we didn't want to carry on.

536
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,032
Coming to America was
like the nail in the coffin.

537
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,711
I drove almost 200 miles
from Silver Springs just to see it.

538
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,476
I enjoyed every minute of it.

539
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,985
I'd drive 200 miles again tomorrow night.
I really enjoyed it.

540
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,920
I'd think these people
are where it's at right now.

541
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,981
It was great.
That's what music's meant to be.

542
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,927
I think that's where rock is going
and where it's going to stay.

543
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,865
My sound was really horrible.
Nothing worked.

544
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:12,136
I had a terrible cold. Sid was, like,
fucked up. We didn't play any note.

545
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,506
And John was like...

546
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,614
Mr. Righteous and Dig My Life,
you know what I mean.

547
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,780
The ego was
of fucking blown out of proportion.

548
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,848
"What the fuck's this all about?
What's the purpose?

549
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,156
"This ain't how it used to be like. "

550
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,458
We were playing like shit
and everyone was loving it.

551
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,532
Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?
Good night.

552
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,670
When I said, "Ever get
the feeling you've been cheated?"...

553
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:53,183
I meant that for us,
who had to perform this stuff.

554
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:57,653
'Cause that's what it had become by then,
just stuff, just rock 'n'roll.

555
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,315
Just trundling out night after night.

556
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,989
It lost its point.

557
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,694
It was too much like
a Rolling Stones-on tour affair.

558
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,060
Too big.

559
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,368
And indeed, when things get that way,
then you should stop.

560
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,600
It's the easiest thing in the world
to just stop.

561
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,268
If you don't want to be a pop star,
just stop being one.

562
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,578
The Sex Pistols came along,
made incredible amount of chaos...

563
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,314
and then broke up.

564
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,218
And left everyone else
to clean up their mess.

565
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,058
The Ramones had to go out there
and keep playing.

566
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:42,394
We kind of felt us and the Sex Pistols
would become...

567
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,162
almost like the Beatles and the Stones
of the '60s.

568
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,330
Like, we were the new revolution,
let's say.

569
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,371
But America wouldn't have it that way.

570
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:56,277
And no record company wanted
to touch anybody after the Sex Pistols...

571
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,245
who was in a punk band.

572
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,808
I liked the Sex Pistols
but they were just there for a second.

573
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,983
They were gone really fast. By the time
the Sex Pistols had come and gone...

574
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,025
there were these great LA bands playing.

575
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,722
Punk, in the neurosense of the word,
where you had to play a certain way...

576
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,731
sound a certain way on record,
look a certain way...

577
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,427
probably worked in England
because England was...

578
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:21,630
A: much more fashion conscious,
and B: poor.

579
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,036
That kind of punk, that kind of anger
certainly doesn't work...

580
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,374
in a '70s America where kids
have plenty of toys to play with.

581
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:36,712
So, music of rebellion,
or music that challenges establishment...

582
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,822
had to take a different form in America.

583
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:52,293
Basically the 200 people that made up...

584
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:56,567
the original punk rock scene of LA
were people who didn't fit in.

585
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,907
And it wasn't just artists...

586
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:04,711
it was working-class people
that were bohemian.

587
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,351
The time that we began X,
it was a frightening time...

588
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,981
because people didn't want to know
what we were talking about.

589
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,087
What we wrote about was
how estranged we were...

590
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,159
and we wrote a lot about being poor
and seeing a lot of wealthy people.

591
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,667
'Cause it was still the Hollywood scene,
there were still movie stars...

592
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,499
and rock stars and producers
and people getting big deals.

593
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,665
There was still Fleetwood Mac,
and we were so different from that.

594
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,006
It was just like Los Angeles in '66, '67.

595
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:42,610
The same kind of street-club activity
was happening all over again...

596
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:45,621
in '78, '79, '80,
and I was just absolutely hooked.

597
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,920
I was everywhere in that day
that you could possibly go.

598
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,723
And I told everybody,
I said, "None of you know this...

599
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:56,391
"but this is exactly what we did
15 years ago, the psychedelic generation...

600
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,732
"and you guys are now
totally insane punk rockers."

601
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,976
X was one of the most exciting bands
I'd ever come across...

602
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,746
and I couldn't believe
that they were actually poetic.

603
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,380
The lyrics had that kind of street,
beatnik impact...

604
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:22,948
took me back to '58, '60, '62,
when the beats were at their height...

605
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:26,087
and I thought,
"Man, this is the same kind of stuff."

606
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:17,578
And everything went along just great
until, at some point...

607
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,346
the audiences went from being
relatively intelligent...

608
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,285
and understanding, interesting people...

609
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:28,654
to kind of scary young kids
who liked to spit at the bands a lot...

610
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:33,428
who wielded chains
and beat up people who had long hair.

611
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,867
And it became a kind of a war
between what was...

612
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,267
and this kind of new, hard-core scene.

613
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,349
Along with the misfits, there were some
who were genuinely psychotic.

614
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,179
And they were there to inflict pain...

615
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,919
and not to be part of the core audience.

616
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:05,818
A song like Johnny Hit and Run Paulene,
we don't play because the audience....

617
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:10,560
I've seen too many
19 and 20-year-old boys...men...

618
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,096
boy-men, going like this...

619
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,865
"Johnny hit and run Paulene,"
and don't know that it's an antirape song.

620
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:23,310
And they're into it for the wrong reasons.
So, we don't play that anymore.

621
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,339
Society stinks.

622
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,397
But this hard-core scene
was particularly scary and violent.

623
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,626
It was what gave punk a bad name.

624
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,402
We kept begging them
to stop spitting at us.

625
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,066
The media wants to make this
into a cartoon, and they say...

626
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,507
in England bands get spit at
by the audience.

627
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:57,536
This spitting was just utter nonsense,
journalistic fabrication.

628
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,742
Unfortunately, the newer crowds
that came into it...

629
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,817
didn't understand that.

630
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:09,817
Spitting on your heroes has been popular
ever since in different ways...

631
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,819
and maybe that's okay,
and maybe that was....

632
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,831
The part of punk was
the thing about the antihero, really.

633
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,129
Yeah, a healthy disrespect for authority...

634
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,603
is what supposedly runs through
the whole history of rock 'n' roll.

635
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,696
Stop!

636
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,238
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
There's no reason to do this song here.

637
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:30,542
That's what the irony was about,
because in a corporate society...

638
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:35,017
where a few record companies and a few
TVnetworks control everything...

639
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:38,350
if you're an act signed to a label
and you pretend to be a rebel...

640
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,219
it seemed to be a bad joke.

641
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,396
I was never a part of any punk rock thing.
I used to read about it.

642
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,695
But it was some sort of elitist thing to me.

643
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,668
I lived in the suburbs.
I couldn't afford to go to nightclubs.

644
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,967
I had a wife and kid,
and I had to go to work.

645
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,269
If music was gonna pay my way...

646
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,243
it had to pay my way
to the same extent as my job.

647
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:37,013
I've had a strange career in the sense...

648
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,641
that I started out
on an independent label predominantly.

649
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:45,154
I was signed within six months
to a very big corporation in America.

650
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,853
I was a pop star, you know.
There's no other word for it.

651
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,417
I found it really at odds
with what I believed...

652
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:54,123
being a musician in the long term was.

653
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,999
From there on,
I just did whatever the hell I wanted to...

654
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,298
and left it to the record company
to sort out.

655
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,136
That's their job. Mine's to make the music.
Theirs is to sell it.

656
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,933
And it never said in my contract...

657
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,706
that I had to make the same record
over and over again.

658
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:33,635
I think it's harder for people
to change the rules in rock 'n' roll...

659
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:37,003
because it's such
a very, very limited form musically...

660
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,134
that it comes down
to somebody's imagination...

661
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,503
what they have in their heart.

662
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,145
As soon as the people got hold
of the idea that it's punk.

663
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,549
We get it. We got it.

664
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,083
And then, when we started
to play other things...

665
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,756
they didn't like it
'cause people don't like change.

666
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,900
When you step into that public arena...

667
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:09,334
on one hand, it's maybe where some
of the greatest possibilities are located...

668
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,465
at the same time,
it's the most dangerous place...

669
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,032
because it's where you're
most easily subverted.

670
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,007
To reach a wide audience,
you have to give something up.

671
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:23,844
People still hate us in England
for making it in America.

672
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,286
I'm glad we did.
You know, somebody had to break out...

673
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,292
and prove that
this thing was a global thing.

674
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,726
It wasn't just a neighborhood thing.

675
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:28,608
When you're struggling to get somewhere,
the struggle can really hold you together.

676
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,895
It's not a blinding rush for fame.

677
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:44,295
You're expressing your soul,
and you gotta do it in the right way.

678
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,797
What killed us was success.

679
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,636
For some reason, we weren't prepared.

680
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,073
We'd spent five years getting there.

681
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,879
Perhaps, after five years,
we'd said our piece, if you like.

682
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,849
A lot of the great groups didn't exist
for very long.

683
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:11,823
To lump artists like the Sex Pistols,
the Clash, and Elvis Costello...

684
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:16,525
under the banner of punk is really
an indication of how categories fail.

685
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:21,299
I suppose everybody wanted one band
to do it like it happened with the Beatles.

686
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,404
And it turned out not to be one band...

687
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,466
but a lot of bands, a lot of journalists...

688
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:31,746
a lot of young people who went into
the record companies and changed them.

689
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:36,252
I remember when Seymour Stein
sold Sire Records to Warner Bros.

690
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,281
Bugs Bunny, the Warner Bros. character...

691
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,086
was in advertisements
in a black leather jacket saying:

692
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,627
"Don't call it punk. Call it new wave."

693
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:49,097
So, new wave was really a term
for college kids, you know.

694
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,633
At the time everybody said:

695
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,464
"I don't like the Ramones,
but I like the Talking Heads."

696
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,471
It was safe. New wave was safe.

697
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,508
Punk rock wasn't necessarily
very musical or melodic...

698
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,372
and I think new wave is when things....

699
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:04,345
You know, a few jangly guitars
and melodies. I guess. I don't know.

700
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,301
We thought we were a punk band
for about a minute.

701
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:51,453
Very early on, just after
we'd figured out our barre chords...

702
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,622
we realized that we wanted
to say more than "Fuck off."

703
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:59,998
Even though there were some cool ways
of saying "Fuck off" around at the time.

704
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,863
New wave is watered-down.

705
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,973
That was the complete corruption
of everything.

706
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,242
It's where everybody tried
to be nice all over again.

707
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,277
Don't be nice. It's the kiss of death.

708
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,486
We were trying to change something.

709
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,559
The music industry. The way we live.

710
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,364
You know, to be accepted
in a way we wanted.

711
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:05,195
I've always believed that to be esoteric...

712
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:09,796
or underground, music of one generation...

713
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,601
becomes the pop music
of the next generation.

714
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,002
You know, there's jazz purists...

715
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,113
whose job is to keep it pure and the same.

716
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:25,077
Rock 'n'roll is the opposite.
It started as a bastard, as a hybrid.

717
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,515
It was never pure to begin with.

718
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,855
When the punk rock groups started,
it was an "us and them " thing.

719
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,361
The establishment was "them, "
and there was "us. "

720
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,058
But I think they had
to grow up very rapidly.

721
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:40,535
Because some of them became successful,
got deals, and realized that really...

722
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:43,538
they had to work with the system
to get anywhere.

723
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:47,434
Some handled it, some left
totally devastated. They got money...

724
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,276
and consequently didn't get that creative
'cause they weren't hungry anymore.

725
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,340
Or they could buy more drugs,
and they ended up dead.

726
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:59,616
You know, only the people
that had any real...

727
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:04,422
content and staying power,
managed to get over that hurdle.

728
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:10,230
Most of the musicians I know,
their work is the core of their identity.

729
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:15,364
It's a good deal of what
they created their identity from.

730
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:19,502
It's fundamental to you.
You feel like it is you.

731
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,673
And so, when you step into...

732
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,683
the mass cultural arena....

733
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:35,282
Like I said, there's a real element of
"You're on dangerous ground."

734
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,220
At the same time, I always thought that
that was where...

735
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:46,158
you found out what you could do.

736
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,443
American corporations
took 10 or 15 years...

737
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,947
to recover from the shock
of the Sex Pistols...

738
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:03,111
and the fluke of actually managing
to sell the Clash to the general public...

739
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:06,883
to really take a step back
and find Nirvana and a few other bands.

740
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:21,903
Punk came....
You know what it was in England.

741
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:25,099
That was the last time anything
important happened in England...

742
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,405
or came from England to affect anybody.

743
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:30,105
You know what happened
is that punk said:

744
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,672
"We're fed up with Pink Floyd,
Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin...

745
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,911
"the sort of skeleton of the Beatles.

746
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,385
"Let's have some music from the street. "

747
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,447
And what's happened
in America in 1991, '90...

748
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:44,386
is that you finally got your own punk.

749
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:05,047
I didn't know him, you know.
But I know that...

750
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:11,316
that type of success is very stressful
on you, you know.

751
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,153
It's very stressful.

752
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:17,182
And because you're constantly....
You feel yourself....

753
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,320
You think you feel yourself slipping away
in some fashion.

754
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,958
Maybe you're not.
Maybe you are, you know.

755
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,511
It brought home to me...

756
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:49,547
as many things have in my maturity...

757
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:53,487
the fact that this is
a very dangerous business.

758
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,063
It's very dangerous for the practitioners.

759
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,941
It's like a fire...

760
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,646
and it burns, and it burns....

761
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,818
And that sounds like
a sort of romantic fire idea...

762
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:28,489
until you realize that
what's keeping the fire alive is bodies.

763
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,905
I think rock 'n'roll exists...

764
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:44,003
to deliver this truth
that needs to be constantly delivered.

765
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,310
Rock, hip-hop, whatever you call it.

766
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:49,545
It reminds us,
like this unspoken message...

767
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,520
is that it is fun to be alive.

768
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,256
It's a hell of a lot better than being dead.

769
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:11,034
I think that my whole life was saved...

770
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:16,305
and opened up and made into a real life
by my favorite singers.

771
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,706
By Johnny Cash, Muddy Waters...

772
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,918
the Rolling Stones, the Beatles.

773
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,556
I'm gonna forget so many people.
John Lee Hooker.

774
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,958
I'll forget a lot of people, but yes,
by the stuff that went before.

775
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:41,567
Rock has thrived on people not necessarily
willfully throwing things into the mix...

776
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:46,132
but stumbling on things, crossing over
short circuits and misconnections...

777
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,609
and the people who have the tight...

778
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:53,305
spandex pants on and their hair just so
and the guitar at the right angle...

779
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,780
aren't it at all, you know.
The cigarette coming from the lip like this.

780
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:02,223
'Cause it's a facsimile that was previously
rock, doesn't make it rock 'n' roll forever.

781
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:06,523
It's somebody in a bedroom somewhere
doing something you haven't heard yet.

782
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,087
With any luck.

783
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:15,527
How did the audience react
when The Stooges first started playing?

784
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,505
What did you look like?

785
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:21,873
I appeared in an aluminum Afro wig
I made myself...

786
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,209
out of strips of heavy-duty aluminum
which I curled.

787
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:29,650
No eyebrow and a woman's
maternity smock, totally white-faced.

788
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,253
I was playing a Hawaiian guitar,
standing on--

789
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:36,814
Another fellow who operated
a Wearing blender.

790
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:41,861
There was another guy whose job it was
to just tip over the top of an amp...

791
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,764
at certain times
with the reverb turned on 10.

792
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,625
It was like....

793
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,032
I also played vacuum cleaner.

794
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:57,007
And people found it really interesting.
